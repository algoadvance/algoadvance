[Leetcode 2502. Design Memory Allocator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2502)
### Problem Statement
You are required to implement a `MemoryAllocator` class that can dynamically allocate and free memory blocks. The class should support the following operations:

- `MemoryAllocator(n)`: Initializes the memory with a size of `n` where all memory blocks are initially free.
- `allocate(size, mID)`: Allocates a block of memory of `size` units with the given `mID`. Returns the starting index of the allocated block if the allocation is successful, otherwise returns -1.
- `free(mID)`: Frees all memory blocks with the given `mID`. Returns the number of blocks that were successfully freed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should happen if `allocate` is called with a size larger than the available memory?
   - It should return -1.
2. Are the allocations contiguous, meaning should they be in a single continuous block of memory?
   - Yes, allocations must be contiguous.
3. What are the constraints on `n` and `size`?
   - Typically, `n` and `size` will be positive integers within reasonable limits for in-memory operations.
4. How should the reallocation be managed if blocks are freed in `free`?
   - Freed blocks should be considered available for subsequent calls to `allocate`.

### Strategy
1. Use a single array to represent memory slots.
2. For `allocate`, find a contiguous block of the required size that is free.
3. For `free`, iterate through the memory array, and mark the blocks with the given `mID` as free.

### Code

```javascript
class MemoryAllocator {
    constructor(n) {
        this.memory = new Array(n).fill(null); // initial memory blocks are free
    }
    
    allocate(size, mID) {
        let n = this.memory.length;
        
        // Try to find a free block of 'size' contiguous memory
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - size; i++) {
            let found = true;
            for (let j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                if (this.memory[i + j] !== null) {
                    found = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) {
                // Allocate the block with mID
                for (let j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                    this.memory[i + j] = mID;
                }
                return i; // Return starting index
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // No sufficient contiguous block found
    }
    
    free(mID) {
        let count = 0;
        
        // Free all blocks with the given mID
        for (let i = 0; i < this.memory.length; i++) {
            if (this.memory[i] === mID) {
                this.memory[i] = null;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count; // Return the number of blocks freed
    }
}

// Example usage
// const allocator = new MemoryAllocator(10);
// console.log(allocator.allocate(3, 1)); // Should print 0
// console.log(allocator.allocate(2, 2)); // Should print 3
// console.log(allocator.free(1));        // Should print 3
// console.log(allocator.allocate(4, 3)); // Should print 0
```

### Time Complexity
- **`allocate(size, mID)`**:
  - Worst-case: O(n * size), where `n` is the length of the memory array. This happens if we need to check almost every possible segment of the memory.
  
- **`free(mID)`**:
  - O(n), where `n` is the length of the memory array, because we iterate through the entire memory array to free blocks.

This design ensures that the operations for allocating and freeing memory are straightforward but efficient for the problem's requirements.
