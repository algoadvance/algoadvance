[Leetcode 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1295)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of possible values for `nums`? 
   - The problem typically assumes that the array `nums` can contain large positive or negative integers.
2. Can `nums` be empty, and what should be returned?
   - If `nums` is empty, we should return 0 since there are no numbers to evaluate.
3. What should be the output for single-digit numbers, which inherently have an odd count of digits?
   - Single-digit numbers should not be counted as they contain an odd number of digits.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Each Number to String**: This allows easy counting of digits.
2. **Check the Length of Each String**: If the length is even, increment the counter.
3. **Return the Counter**: The final count will be the number of integers with an even number of digits.

### Code

```javascript
var findNumbers = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num.toString().length % 2 === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to 0.
2. **Iterate Over Numbers**: Loop through each number in the array.
3. **Convert to String and Check Length**: Convert the current number to a string and check if its length is even.
4. **Increment the Counter**: If the number of digits is even, increment the counter.
5. **Return**: After the loop is finished, return the final count.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We iterate through each element in the array exactly once. The conversion to string and length checking are O(1) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we use a constant amount of space for variables.

This solution efficiently counts the numbers with an even number of digits by leveraging simple string operations and iteration.
