[Leetcode 2830. Maximize the Profit as the Salesman](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2830)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `offers` where `offers[i] = [start, end, price]` represents an offer with a start day, end day, and price. As a salesman, you can either accept or reject an offer. Your goal is to maximize the total profit such that no two offers overlap.

Write a function `maximize_profit(offers)` that takes in the list of offers and returns the maximum profit you can achieve. Offers are non-overlapping if the start and end days of one offer do not intersect with the start and end days of any other offer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How many offers can be in the `offers` list? (Upper limit)
   - Are the start and end days within a specific range?
   - Is it guaranteed that the `end` day is always greater than or equal to the `start` day for each offer?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the function return an integer representing the maximum profit?

Assuming typical competitive programming constraints:
   - Number of offers: \( n \leq 10^5 \)
   - Days are within a reasonable range e.g., \( 1 \leq start, end \leq 10^9 \)

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with binary search:

1. **Sort the Offers:** 
   - Sort the offers based on their end day. This will help us determine the maximum profit up to any given offer efficiently.

2. **DP Array:** 
   - Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit up to the `i-th` offer.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to the price of the first offer.

3. **Binary Search for Non-overlapping Offers:**
   - For each offer `i`, use binary search to find the last offer `j` where `offers[j].end < offers[i].start`.

4. **DP Transition:**
   - If such an offer `j` exists, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], offers[i].price + dp[j])`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], offers[i].price)`.

5. **Result:**
   - The answer will be `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the number of offers.

### Code

```javascript
function maximize_profit(offers) {
    offers.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    const n = offers.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(0);
    dp[0] = offers[0][2];

    function binarySearch(end) {
        let left = 0, right = n - 1;
        let res = -1;
        while (left <= right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (offers[mid][1] < end) {
                res = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let profitWithCurrent = offers[i][2];
        let j = binarySearch(offers[i][0]);
        if (j != -1) {
            profitWithCurrent += dp[j];
        }
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], profitWithCurrent);
    }

    return dp[n-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Binary Search for each DP transition:** \( O(\log n) \times n = O(n \log n) \)
- **Total:** The overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \), which is efficient for \( n \leq 10^5 \).

This solution efficiently maximizes the profit by leveraging sorting and binary search, ensuring the non-overlapping constraint is preserved.
