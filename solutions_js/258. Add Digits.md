[Leetcode 258. Add Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l258)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of the input `num`?
     - Typically, `num` will be a non-negative integer.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should we handle the case when `num` is 0?
     - The output should be 0.
   
### Strategy
A straightforward approach would be to repeatedly sum the digits until we end up with a single-digit number. However, a more efficient way leverages mathematical properties. The problem can be reduced to finding the digital root of the number. The digital root can be calculated in constant time using modulo operation:
   - If `num == 0`, return `0`.
   - If `num % 9 == 0`, return `9`.
   - Otherwise, return `num % 9`.

This simplification arises from modular arithmetic properties in numeral systems.

### Code

```javascript
function addDigits(num) {
    if (num === 0) return 0;
    if (num % 9 === 0) return 9;
    return num % 9;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm computes the result in constant time using modulo operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space usage is constant, as no additional data structures are needed.

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Special Case Handling**:
   - Check if the number is 0, and immediately return 0 as the result.
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Use the modulo operation to determine the digital root efficiently.
     - If the number is perfectly divisible by 9 (and non-zero), return 9.
     - Otherwise, return the remainder of the division by 9, which gives the required single-digit result.
