[Leetcode 2365. Task Scheduler II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2365)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of tasks where each task represents the type of work. In order to prevent burn out, the same type of work should not be performed again until a specific number of days have passed since the last time it was performed.

You are given an integer `n` which represents the minimum number of days that have to pass before the same type of work can be performed again. Return the minimum number of days to complete the tasks given.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: tasks = [1,2,1,2,3,1], n = 2
Output: 7

Explanation:
One optimal way of scheduling the tasks is:
Day 1: Task 1
Day 2: Task 2
Day 3: Idle
Day 4: Task 1
Day 5: Task 2
Day 6: Idle
Day 7: Task 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before we dive into the solution, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Constraints**:
   - What is the length of the tasks array? 
   - What is the range of values for `n`? 
2. **All tasks need to be performed exactly once**.
3. **In case of multiple optimal ways**:
   - Should we return the length of the shortest possible completion time?

Assuming standard constraints as follows unless specified otherwise:
- 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= n <= 10^4
- Each task is represented by a unique non-negative integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Track the last occurrence**: Use a map to track the last day each task was performed.
2. **Iterate through the tasks**:
   - Calculate the earliest day you can perform the current task based on the minimum gap `n`.
   - Either schedule the task on this earliest day or the next free day if the earliest day has already been occupied by some other task.
3. **Increment day counter** to keep track of the total number of days as we progress through the tasks.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(T) where T is the number of tasks since each task is processed once and tracking the last occurrence using a map is O(1) on average.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function taskSchedulerII(tasks, n) {
    let day = 0;
    const lastDayPerformed = new Map();
    
    for (const task of tasks) {
        if (lastDayPerformed.has(task)) {
            day = Math.max(day, lastDayPerformed.get(task) + n + 1);
        }
        day++;
        lastDayPerformed.set(task, day);
    }
    
    return day;
}

// Example Usage:
let tasks = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1];
let n = 2;
console.log(taskSchedulerII(tasks, n));  // Output: 7
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day = 0`: Represents the current day.
   - `lastDayPerformed = new Map()`: Tracks the last day a task was performed.

2. **Processing each task**:
   - For each task, check the last day it was performed.
   - Calculate the next available day the task can be performed respecting the gap `n`.
   - Update the `day` and the last performed day in the map.

3. **Return the final value of `day`**: This represents the minimum number of days required to complete all the tasks with the given constraints.
