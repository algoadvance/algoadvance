[Leetcode 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1129)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, red edges, and blue edges. The edges are directed, the red edges are directed and the blue edges are directed.

You are also given three arrays:
- `redEdges` where each `redEdges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a directed red edge from node `ai` to node `bi`.
- `blueEdges` where each `blueEdges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node `ui` to node `vi`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the path alternates colors (beginning with either color). If there is no such path, `answer[x]` must be `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Properties**: Are the nodes guaranteed to be connected?
2. **Path Alternation**: Should the path strictly alternate colors, or can it consist of any valid combination of red and blue edges?
3. **Multiple Edges**: Can there be multiple edges (both red and blue) between the same pair of nodes?
4. **Edge Cases**: Is it possible for certain edges or nodes to be nonexistent?

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use adjacency lists to represent the graph with both red and blue edges.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore using a BFS approach to find the shortest path, ensuring each step alternates the edge color.
3. **Visited State**: Maintain a visited state to keep track of nodes visited with specific colors to avoid cycles.
4. **Initialization**: Initialize distances and a queue to facilitate BFS.
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle the scenario where nodes are isolated or unreachable.

## Code

```javascript
function shortestAlternatingPaths(n, redEdges, blueEdges) {
    // Initialize adjacency lists for red and blue edges
    const redAdj = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    const blueAdj = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    
    for (const [u, v] of redEdges) {
        redAdj[u].push(v);
    }
    
    for (const [u, v] of blueEdges) {
        blueAdj[u].push(v);
    }
    
    // Initialize result array with -1 and set the starting point to 0
    const result = Array(n).fill(-1);
    result[0] = 0;

    // Queue for BFS: [node, step_count, previous_color]
    const queue = [[0, 0, null]];
    
    // Visited sets for red and blue
    const visitedRed = new Set();
    const visitedBlue = new Set();
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [node, steps, prevColor] = queue.shift();
        
        const currentNodes = prevColor === 'red' ? blueAdj[node] : redAdj[node];
        const visitedSet = prevColor === 'red' ? visitedBlue : visitedRed;
        const nextColor = prevColor === 'red' ? 'blue' : 'red';
        
        // Explore the nodes with alternate color
        for (const nextNode of currentNodes) {
            if (!visitedSet.has(nextNode)) {
                if (result[nextNode] === -1) {
                    result[nextNode] = steps + 1;
                }
                queue.push([nextNode, steps + 1, nextColor]);
                visitedSet.add(nextNode);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating adjacency lists takes O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **BFS Traversal**: Each node and edge are processed once, making the BFS traversal O(V + E).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

This solution uses BFS to ensure the shortest path is found and alternates edge colors as required. It properly handles disconnected nodes and isolated edges by marking unreachable nodes with `-1`.
