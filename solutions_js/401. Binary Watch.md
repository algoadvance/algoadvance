[Leetcode 401. Binary Watch](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l401)
### Problem Statement
A Binary Watch has 4 LEDs that represent the hours (0-11) and 6 LEDs that represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED can be either on (1) or off (0).

Given a non-negative integer `turnedOn`, which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

The order of the output does not matter.

The hour LEDs represent the following values:

- 8, 4, 2, 1 (from left to right)

The minute LEDs represent the following values:

- 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (from left to right)

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are duplicated times allowed in the output?
   - No, only unique times should be returned in the output.

2. What format should the output times be in?
   - The times should be in the `"H:MM"` format where `H` is the hour (0-11) and `MM` is the minute (00-59).

3. Are there any constraints on the size of the input `turnedOn`?
   - Yes, `turnedOn` will be in the range [0, 10].

### Strategy
1. Use a brute-force approach to iterate through all possible hours (0-11) and minutes (0-59).
2. For each combination of hour and minute, count the number of 1s in their binary representations using bitwise operations.
3. If the total count of 1s matches `turnedOn`, format the time and add it to the result list.
4. Return the result list.

### Code

```javascript
function readBinaryWatch(turnedOn) {
    const result = [];
    
    for (let h = 0; h < 12; h++) {
        for (let m = 0; m < 60; m++) {
            const binHour = h.toString(2);
            const binMinute = m.toString(2);
            
            // Count number of 1s in the binary representations
            const onesCount = binHour.split('1').length - 1 + binMinute.split('1').length - 1;
            
            if (onesCount === turnedOn) {
                result.push(`${h}:${m < 10 ? '0' + m : m}`);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
// turnedOn = 1
// Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
console.log(readBinaryWatch(1));
```

### Time Complexity
The algorithm iterates over all possible hour (0-11) and minute (0-59) combinations, making it a nested loop with constant bounds.

- The outer loop iterates 12 times.
- The inner loop iterates 60 times.
- Therefore, the total number of iterations is \(12 \times 60 = 720\).

Each iteration involves:
- Converting numbers to binary (constant time for small numbers).
- Counting bits (constant time for small numbers).

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(1)\) because the nested loops have constant upper bounds.

### Conclusion
This solution leverages brute-force iteration with bitwise counting for simplicity and effectiveness given the constrained input size. The overall approach ensures that all possible times are evaluated and those matching the `turnedOn` count are returned in the specified format.
