[Leetcode 589. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l589)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of an N-ary tree. Implement a function to return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

An N-ary tree is a tree in which a node can have any number of children.

**Example:**

Input: `root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]`
 
         1
       / | \
      3  2  4
     / \
    5   6

Output: `[1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output when the input tree is empty?**
   - The output should be an empty list `[]`.

2. **Can the tree have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the tree can have duplicate values but that should not affect the traversal.

3. **What is the structure of the tree node?**
   - A node has two properties: `val` (integer) and `children` (list of child nodes).

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a Node.
function Node(val, children) {
    this.val = val;
    this.children = children;
}

/**
 * @param {Node} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var preorder = function(root) {
    const result = [];
    
    function traverse(node) {
        if (!node) return;
        result.push(node.val);                // Visit the node
        for (let child of node.children) {    // Visit all children in order
            traverse(child);
        }
    }
    
    traverse(root);
    return result;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Define a result array**: This will store the nodes' values in preorder sequence.
2. **Helper function (traverse)**: 
   - Base case: If the current node is `null`, simply return.
   - Recursive case: 
     - Add the current node's value to the result array.
     - Recursively call the `traverse` function for each child of the current node.
3. **Initial call**: Call the `traverse` function with the root node.
4. **Return the result array**: After traversing the entire tree, return the result array containing the preorder traversal.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), which is the space used by the recursion stack plus the space used to store the result. In the worst case, if the tree is highly unbalanced, the recursion stack might consume O(N) space.
