[Leetcode 2109. Adding Spaces to a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2109)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a list of integers `spaces`, return a new string with spaces added at the positions specified in the list `spaces`. The spaces list is zero-indexed, meaning a position of `0` in the list corresponds to the beginning of the string. The spaces are added in order and the resultant string should have the correct characters and spaces at the specified positions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do we need to worry about any constraints on the length of `s` or the `spaces` array?**
   - Yes, they are typically constrained by the usual bounds for programming competitions (e.g., `1 <= s.length <= 1000` for practical reasons).

2. **Are all positions in `spaces` guaranteed to be valid positions within the bounds of the string `s`?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that all entries in `spaces` are valid indices for `s`.

3. **Should the original string `s` be modified, or should we return a new string?**
   - We should return a new string with the spaces added.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize an array to construct the result:**
   - Create an array `result` to build our new string incrementally to handle efficient string concatenation compared to repeatedly using string concatenation which is less efficient in JavaScript.

2. **Iterate through the original string `s`:**
   - Use a pointer or index to traverse the string `s`.

3. **Insert spaces at specified indices:**
   - Check if the current index matches any index in the `spaces` list.
   - If it does, append a space to `result`.

4. **Append the current character:**
   - Append the current character from `s` to `result`.

5. **Convert the array back to a string:**
   - Once the iteration is complete, join the `result` array into a string using `join('')` method.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation for the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number[]} spaces
 * @return {string}
 */
var addSpaces = function(s, spaces) {
    let result = [];
    let spaceIndex = 0;
    let spaceLen = spaces.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        // Check if the current position is in the spaces list
        if (spaceIndex < spaceLen && spaces[spaceIndex] === i) {
            result.push(' ');
            spaceIndex++;
        }
        result.push(s[i]);
    }
    
    return result.join('');
};

// Example Usage
const s = "leetcode";
const spaces = [4];
console.log(addSpaces(s, spaces)); // Output: "leet code"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is:

- **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the number of elements in the `spaces` array.
  - We iterate through the string `s` once (`O(n)`).
  - We also iterate through the `spaces` array as needed, resulting in an `O(m)` time complexity for space insertion.

Overall, the solution is efficient for typical input sizes expected in coding interviews.
