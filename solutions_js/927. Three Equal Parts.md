[Leetcode 927. Three Equal Parts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l927)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` which consists of only `0`s and `1`s. Your task is to divide the array into three non-empty parts such that all of these parts represent the same binary value.

If it is possible to partition the array into three parts with equal binary value, return any `[i, j]` such that:
- `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i]` is the first part,
- `arr[i + 1], arr[i + 2], ..., arr[j - 1]` is the second part, and
- `arr[j], arr[j + 1], ..., arr[arr.length - 1]` is the third part.

If it is not possible, return `[-1, -1]`.

Note that the entire part is used for representing the binary value, so leading zeros are counted. E.g.,  `001` is not equal to `1`, but `1` is equal to `1`.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: [0,3]

Input: arr = [1,1,0,1,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
```

### Constraints

- `3 <= arr.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `arr[i]` is `0` or `1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. How do we count the binary values of partitions? Is it with the leading zero?
   - Yes, leading zeros are counted.

2. Can we return any valid partition, or do we need to follow a specific order?
   - Any valid partition is acceptable.

3. If the binary values are the same, can the partitions have different lengths?
   - Yes, partitions can have different lengths as long as the binary values are the same.

## Strategy
1. **Count the Number of Ones:** 
   - Calculate the total number of `1`s in the array. If this is not divisible by 3, return `[-1, -1]`.

2. **Partition the Ones:**
   - If the total number of `1`s is divisible by 3, each part can contain `one_third` number of `1`s. 

3. **Find Starting Points:**
   - Identify the starting index of each partition with exactly `one_third` number of `1`s.
  
4. **Verify and Assemble the Result:**
   - Check if the sequence from each starting point to the end of the array forms the same binary value.
   - If so, find the potential indices `[i, j]` where the partitions can be divided.

## Code

```javascript
function threeEqualParts(arr) {
    const totalOnes = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);

    // If the number of 1s is not divisible by 3, we can't part the array into 3 equal parts.
    if (totalOnes % 3 !== 0) return [-1, -1];
    
    const oneThird = totalOnes / 3;
    if (oneThird === 0) return [0, arr.length - 1]; // If there are no 1s, we can return any valid partition
    
    let first = -1, second = -1, third = -1, onesCount = 0;
    
    // Finding the starting positions of the three parts
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === 1) {
            onesCount++;
            if (onesCount === 1) first = i;
            else if (onesCount === oneThird + 1) second = i;
            else if (onesCount === 2 * oneThird + 1) third = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the parts starting at first, second and third index are the same
    while (third < arr.length && arr[first] === arr[second] && arr[first] === arr[third]) {
        first++;
        second++;
        third++;
    }
    
    if (third === arr.length) return [first - 1, second];
    
    return [-1, -1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
  - We traverse the array a few times: once to count the 1s and another to find starting points of each partition, and finally a pass to verify the partitions.

- The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are only using a few additional variables regardless of the size of the input array.
