[Leetcode 2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2558)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `gifts` where each element represents the number of gifts in a pile. The richest pile is the one with the most number of gifts. Your task is to perform a specified number of `k` operations. In each operation, you will be taking half of the gifts (rounded down) from the richest pile and redistributing them. Your goal is to return the total number of gifts remaining after `k` operations.

**Example:**

```javascript
Input: gifts = [8, 10, 15], k = 3
Output: 32
Explanation:
1st operation: Take 7 gifts (from pile of 15, leaving 8), total remaining = 8+10+8 = 26
2nd operation: Take 5 gifts (from pile of 10, leaving 5), total remaining = 8+5+8 = 21
3rd operation: Take 4 gifts (from pile of 8, leaving 4), total remaining = 4+5+8 = 17
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: What are the minimum and maximum values for `gifts` and `k`?
2. **Ties**: If there are multiple piles with the same number of gifts (and those tie as the richest), does any priority matter for choosing the richest pile? (Assume no priority needed if not specified)
3. **Precision**: Should we always round down when taking half of the richest pile?

Assuming:
- Length of `gifts` array and values are within reasonably small bounds for a plausible solution.
- Standard rounding rules apply (e.g., `Math.floor` for half value calculation).

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**: Use a Max-Heap (Priority Queue) to efficiently manage and retrieve the richest pile.
2. **Operations**:
   - Build the max-heap from the `gifts` array.
   - For `k` operations:
     1. Extract the max (richest pile).
     2. Calculate the number of gifts to take: `Math.floor(richest / 2)`.
     3. Insert the remaining gifts back into the heap.
   - Sum the remaining elements in the heap after the `k` operations to get the final result.

## Code

```javascript
class MaxHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  push(val) {
    this.heap.push(val);
    this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
    const max = this.heap[0];
    this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
    this.bubbleDown(0);
    return max;
  }

  bubbleUp(index) {
    const parent = (index - 1) >> 1;
    if (index > 0 && this.heap[parent] < this.heap[index]) {
      [this.heap[parent], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[parent]];
      this.bubbleUp(parent);
    }
  }

  bubbleDown(index) {
    const left = (index * 2) + 1;
    const right = (index * 2) + 2;
    let largest = index;

    if (left < this.heap.length && this.heap[left] > this.heap[largest]) largest = left;
    if (right < this.heap.length && this.heap[right] > this.heap[largest]) largest = right;

    if (largest !== index) {
      [this.heap[largest], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[largest]];
      this.bubbleDown(largest);
    }
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.heap.length === 0;
  }
}

var pickGifts = function(gifts, k) {
  const maxHeap = new MaxHeap();

  for (let gift of gifts) {
    maxHeap.push(gift);
  }

  while (k-- > 0) {
    let richest = maxHeap.pop();
    let take = Math.floor(richest / 2);
    maxHeap.push(richest - take);
  }

  return maxHeap.heap.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(pickGifts([8, 10, 15], 3)); // Output: 32
```

## Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: Each push and pop operation on the heap is `O(log n)`.
- **Total Complexity**: Building the heap takes `O(n log n)`. Performing `k` operations involves `k` push and pop operations, each costing `O(log n)`, therefore the total time complexity is `O(n log n + k log n)`.

This is efficient for reasonably bounded input sizes typically found in interview problems.
