[Leetcode 777. Swap Adjacent in LR String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l777)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `start` and a string `end`, both of length `n`. The strings only contain the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'X'`. You can transform `start` into `end` by making the following moves any number of times:

1. Swap the positions of 'L' and 'X' such that 'L' can move to the left of 'X'.
2. Swap the positions of 'R' and 'X' such that 'R' can move to the right of 'X'.

Return `true` if and only if it is possible to transform `start` into `end`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the strings always be of equal length?
2. Are we only allowed to swap adjacent positions?

For simplicity, letâ€™s assume the strings are always of equal length and adjacent swaps are the only operations allowed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we must check a few key conditions:

1. **Character count and order matters**:
    - Both strings must have the same number of 'L', 'R', and 'X'.
    - The relative order of 'L' and 'R' in reduced strings (ignoring 'X') must be the same.

2. **Valid Moves**:
    - An 'L' in the `start` string must not move to the right.
    - An 'R' in the `start` string must not move to the left.

### Plan

1. Verify both strings have the same characters in the same frequency.
2. Check positions of the characters 'L' and 'R' to ensure valid moves.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
var canTransform = function(start, end) {
    if (start.length !== end.length) return false;
    
    // Filter out 'X' and check if remaining sequences of 'L' and 'R' match
    let filteredStart = start.replace(/X/g, '');
    let filteredEnd = end.replace(/X/g, '');
    if (filteredStart !== filteredEnd) return false;
    
    let startL = [], endL = [];
    let startR = [], endR = [];
    
    // Collect the positions of 'L' and 'R' in start and end strings
    for (let i = 0; i < start.length; i++) {
        if (start[i] === 'L') startL.push(i);
        if (start[i] === 'R') startR.push(i);
        if (end[i] === 'L') endL.push(i);
        if (end[i] === 'R') endR.push(i);
    }

    // Check if 'L's in start can move to positions in end
    for (let i = 0; i < startL.length; i++) {
        if (startL[i] < endL[i]) return false; // 'L' can only move left
    }
    
    // Check if 'R's in start can move to positions in end
    for (let i = 0; i < startR.length; i++) {
        if (startR[i] > endR[i]) return false; // 'R' can only move right
    }
    
    return true;
};

// Example usage:
// console.log(canTransform("RXXLRXRXL", "XRLXXRRLX")); // Outputs true
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution processes the strings a few times (to filter 'X's, find positions of 'L' and 'R'), all of which are linear operations. Hence, the overall time complexity is:

  **O(n) - linear time complexity**

where `n` is the length of the input strings. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the additional arrays used to track positions of 'L' and 'R'.
