[Leetcode 1036. Escape a Large Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1036)
## Problem Statement:

You are given two lists of blocked cells on a grid and a starting and a target point. You need to determine whether you can escape from the starting point to the target point considering the blocked cells.

The grid size is \([1, 10^6] \times [1, 10^6]\), and you need to determine if there's a clear path from the starting point to the target point without passing through any blocked cells.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are points guaranteed to fall within the grid bounds?**
   - Yes, the starting and target points, as well as blocked cells, are within the grid.

2. **Are the blocked cells a dense subpart of the grid?**
   - The problem description doesn't explicitly state, but it's important to check both large and trivial cases.

3. **What are the expected input constraints?**
   - The coordinates for the grid as well as the size of blocked cells list.

## Code:

```javascript
var isEscapePossible = function(blocked, source, target) {
    const BLOCKED_THRESHOLD = 200; 
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    const n = 1000000; // maximum grid size

    const hashPosition = ([x, y]) => `${x},${y}`;
    const blockedSet = new Set(blocked.map(hashPosition));
    
    const bfs = (start, end) => {
        let queue = [start];
        let visited = new Set([hashPosition(start)]);
        let steps = 0;

        while (queue.length > 0 && steps < BLOCKED_THRESHOLD) {
            let newQueue = [];
            for (let [cx, cy] of queue) {
                for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
                    const nx = cx + dx;
                    const ny = cy + dy;
                    if (nx < 0 || ny < 0 || nx >= n || ny >= n) continue;

                    const newPos = [nx, ny];
                    const hashedPos = hashPosition(newPos);
                    if (hashedPos === hashPosition(end)) return true;

                    if (!blockedSet.has(hashedPos) && !visited.has(hashedPos)) {
                        visited.add(hashedPos);
                        newQueue.push(newPos);
                    }
                }
            }
            queue = newQueue;
            steps += 1;
        }
        return steps >= BLOCKED_THRESHOLD;
    };

    return bfs(source, target) && bfs(target, source);
};

```

## Strategy:

1. **Understanding BFS Approach**:
    - The algorithm utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore each possible path step by step.
    - Uses a `blockedSet` to check blocked cells in O(1) time.

2. **Handling Large Grid**:
    - Due to the potential size of the grid, the algorithm limits the number of steps to `200`, which is derived from the theoretical maximum number of cells blocked to ensure we do not get stuck in an infinite loop.
    - This threshold aims to check not just reachability within the blocked cells, but whether an actual escape route can be found around them.

3. **Bidirectional Search**:
    - To handle extreme cases, it performs a search from both the source and the target. If either search confirms escape, returns `true`.

4. **Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: Primarily constrained by our cap of steps, making it effectively O(1) for this problemâ€™s theoretical limits.
    - **Space Complexity**: Uses additional space for visited nodes and the queue, but these are proportional to the nodes visited during BFS limiting, which is also constrained by the step cap.

The algorithm is designed to efficiently handle both trivial and extreme cases by using a step constraint in a large grid scenario. 

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The theoretical upper bound is O(BLOCKED_THRESHOLD) due to the BFS constraint limiting to 200 iterations, regardless of grid size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(blocked.size + BLOCKED_THRESHOLD) due to storage of visited nodes and queue operations constrained by the BFS steps.
