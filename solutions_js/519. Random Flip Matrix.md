[Leetcode 519. Random Flip Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l519)
### Problem Statement

You are given the number of rows `m` and number of columns `n` of a 2D binary matrix initialized with all `0's`. Implement the `Flip` and `Reset` functions:

1. **Flip:** This function should flip a `0` to a `1` randomly and then return the position `[row, col]` of that flip. Each zero is equally likely to be flipped.
2. **Reset:** This function should set all the entries in the matrix back to `0`.

Design and implement a class `Solution` for this problem.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Can `m` or `n` be zero?
    - Are the limits on `m` and `n` within a certain range? (Usually, constraints help to optimize the solution.)

2. **Behavior of Flip and Reset:**
    - What happens if all 0's are flipped and `Flip` is called again? Should it throw an error, or should it return some invalid position?
    - Will the matrix be used concurrently? This helps understand if thread-safety needs to be considered.

Assuming reasonable constraints (e.g., \(1 \leq m \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)), and that all method calls are valid and Flip is never called more than the matrix size, letâ€™s proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

A naive approach would involve maintaining and shuffling the entire matrix, but that would be too memory-inefficient. Instead, we'll use a hash map to track already flipped cells and an efficient way to generate random unique positions.

1. **Initialization**: Maintain a set (map) to track the flipped positions, the total number of positions, and a function to convert a one-dimensional index to a matrix coordinate.
2. **Flip**:
    - Randomly generate an index.
    - Check if this index has already been flipped.
    - If flipped, generate another index until an unused one is found.
    - Mark it as used and return its position.
3. **Reset**:
    - Clear the tracking structure to reset the state.

### Time Complexity
- **Flip:** Average \(O(1)\) time using hash map for tracking flips.
- **Reset:** \(O(1)\) time to clear the tracking structure.

Here's a potential implementation of this strategy:

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
    constructor(m, n) {
        this.m = m;
        this.n = n;
        this.total = m * n;
        this.map = new Map();
        this.size = 0;
    }
    
    flip() {
        const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * (this.total - this.size));
        let idx = x;
        if (this.map.has(x)) {
            idx = this.map.get(x);
        }
        
        this.map.set(x, this.map.has(this.total - this.size - 1) 
                        ? this.map.get(this.total - this.size - 1) 
                        : this.total - this.size - 1);
        
        this.size++;
        return [Math.floor(idx / this.n), idx % this.n];
    }
    
    reset() {
        this.size = 0;
        this.map.clear();
    }
}

// Example of usage:
const obj = new Solution(3, 1);
console.log(obj.flip()); // Random position, e.g., [0,0]
console.log(obj.flip()); // Another random position
console.log(obj.reset()); // Resets the board
```

In this implementation:
- We store and map indices to quickly find available positions.
- We convert linear indices back to 2D coordinates for the matrix.
- The `random()` function ensures uniform random distribution over unused indices.
