[Leetcode 85. Maximal Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l85)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix filled with `0`'s and `1`'s. Find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return its area.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum and minimum possible values for `m` and `n`?
     - Generally, we can assume typical constraints for interview problems, where `m` and `n` can go up to 200. But confirm if specific constraints exist.

2. **Matrix Characteristics:**
   - Can the matrix be empty?
     - It's commonly assumed that the matrix is non-empty, but clarify if an empty matrix should be considered.

3. **Output Specifics:**
   - Should the function return only the area or also the dimensions of the rectangle?
     - The problem specifies returning the area.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can take advantage of the solution to the largest rectangle in a histogram problem. The idea is:

1. **Histograms by Rows:** Iterate over each row, converting the matrix row into a histogram (height array) by measuring the consecutive ones.
2. **Dynamic Histograms:** Treat the entry `height[j]` of the histogram for row `i` as the height of a bar in a histogram where all bars end at row `i`.
3. **Calculate Maximal Rectangle:** Use the largest rectangle in histogram approach for each row's histogram representation to determine the maximum area rectangle ending at that row.

### Code

```javascript
function maximalRectangle(matrix) {
    if (matrix.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    const heights = new Array(n).fill(0);

    let maxArea = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Update the current row's histogram heights
            if (matrix[i][j] === '1') {
                heights[j]++;
            } else {
                heights[j] = 0;
            }
        }
        // Compute the maximal rectangle for the current row's histogram
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, largestRectangleArea(heights));
    }

    return maxArea;
}

function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
    heights.push(0);  // Add a zero height to ensure the stack gets emptied
    const stack = [];
    let maxArea = 0;
    let index = 0;

    while (index < heights.length) {
        if (stack.length === 0 || heights[index] >= heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            stack.push(index);
            index++;
        } else {
            const height = heights[stack.pop()];
            const width = stack.length === 0 ? index : index - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
    }
    heights.pop(); // Restore the heights array by removing the 0 height
    return maxArea;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Histogram:** Each row update of the heights array is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of columns.
- **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:** Each call to `largestRectangleArea` is `O(n)`, and is called `m` times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.
