[Leetcode 682. Baseball Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l682)
### Problem Statement

You are keeping score for a baseball game with the following rules:
1. The input is a list of strings where each string can be one of the following:
    - An integer: a new score that you need to add to the record.
    - `"+"`: record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
    - `"D"`: record a new score that is double the previous score.
    - `"C"`: invalidate the previous score and remove it from the record.
2. You need to return the sum of all the scores after performing all the operations.

### Example
```javascript
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30

Explanation:
- "5" - Record a score of 5.
- "2" - Record a score of 2.
- "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, which is 2.
- "D" - Record a score that is double of the previous score, which is 10.
- "+" - Record a score that is the sum of the previous two scores, which is 15.

The total score is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length range of the input list?
2. Are there constraints on the values or the format of the integers in the list?
3. Can we assume the input will always be valid?

Assuming standard constraints for a coding interview:

### Strategy

1. Use a stack to keep track of the scores.
2. Iterate through each element in the list and perform the operations based on the rules:
    - If the element is an integer, convert it and push onto the stack.
    - If it is `"C"`, pop the top element from the stack.
    - If it is `"D"`, double the top element and push the result onto the stack.
    - If it is `"+"`, sum the top two elements and push the result onto the stack.
3. At the end, sum all the elements in the stack and return the result.

### Code

```javascript
function calPoints(ops) {
    let stack = [];

    for (let op of ops) {
        if (!isNaN(op)) { // Check if it's a number
            stack.push(parseInt(op));
        } else if (op === "C") {
            stack.pop();
        } else if (op === "D") {
            stack.push(2 * stack[stack.length - 1]);
        } else if (op === "+") {
            stack.push(stack[stack.length - 1] + stack[stack.length - 2]);
        }
    }

    return stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

// Test example
console.log(calPoints(["5","2","C","D","+"])); // Output: 30
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input list. Each operation is processed in constant time, and accumulating the sum of the stack at the end also takes linear time.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) because, in the worst case, we're storing all the scores in the stack.
