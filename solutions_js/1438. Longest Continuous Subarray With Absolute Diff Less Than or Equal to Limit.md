[Leetcode 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1438)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest continuous subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: All subarrays are:
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |4-2| = 2 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |7-4| = 3 <= 4.
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are all integers in the `nums` array positive?
2. Can the `nums` array contain duplicate elements?
3. What is the range of values for `limit` and `nums`?

### Strategy

We can solve this problem efficiently using a sliding window approach combined with two deques to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the current window. The steps are as follows:

1. Initialize two deques to store indices of elements in non-decreasing order (for min) and non-increasing order (for max).
2. Use a sliding window approach with two pointers: `start` and `end`.
3. Initially, both pointers start at the beginning of the array.
4. Expand the `end` pointer to include more elements in the window and update the deques.
5. While the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum element in the current window is greater than `limit`, increment the `start` pointer to shrink the window.
6. Track the size of the window during this process and update the result accordingly.
7. Return the size of the longest window found.

### Code

```javascript
var longestSubarray = function(nums, limit) {
    let maxDeque = [], minDeque = [];
    let start = 0, longest = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
        while (maxDeque.length && nums[end] > nums[maxDeque[maxDeque.length - 1]]) {
            maxDeque.pop();
        }
        maxDeque.push(end);

        while (minDeque.length && nums[end] < nums[minDeque[minDeque.length - 1]]) {
            minDeque.pop();
        }
        minDeque.push(end);

        while (nums[maxDeque[0]] - nums[minDeque[0]] > limit) {
            start++;
            if (maxDeque[0] < start) {
                maxDeque.shift();
            }
            if (minDeque[0] < start) {
                minDeque.shift();
            }
        }
        longest = Math.max(longest, end - start + 1);
    }

    return longest;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. The reason is that each element is added and removed from the deques at most once. This ensures that all operations within the loop run in constant time on average, making the algorithm linear.
