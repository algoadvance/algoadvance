[Leetcode 877. Stone Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l877)
## Problem Statement:

Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones [piles[i]]. The objective of the game is to determine if Alice wins the game assuming both Alice and Bob play optimally.

Alice always goes first. Both players start with a score of 0. On each player's turn, that player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row. The game ends when there are no more piles left to take, and the player with the higher score wins.

Can you determine whether Alice wins the game?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice starts first, and she can always win by picking the first pile or the last pile, and one optimal strategy would be:
- Alice chooses first pile (5), then Bob chooses 4, then Alice chooses 5, and finally Bob chooses 3.
- Alice's score is 10 (5 + 5), and Bob's score is 7 (4 + 3).
```

**Constraints:**
- 2 <= piles.length <= 500
- piles.length is even.
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 500

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the solution account for both players playing optimally?
2. Is the goal to determine whether Alice wins no matter what?
3. Confirming that the length of piles is always even.
4. Should we consider the possibility of a draw?

## Strategy:
1. Since both players play optimally, we need to recognize that the game can be reduced to a dynamic programming problem to simulate choices both players make.
2. Create a memoization table to store results of subproblems (i.e., the optimal scores from subarrays of piles).
3. Use a minimax approach where Alice tries to maximize her score while Bob tries to minimize Alice's score on his turn.
4. Compute the possible score difference between Alice and Bob, which if positive, indicates Alice wins.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} piles
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var stoneGame = function(piles) {
    const n = piles.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Initializing base cases: when i == j, only one pile to take
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = piles[i];
    }
    
    // Fill the dp array
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            let j = i + length - 1;
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(piles[i] - dp[i + 1][j], piles[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1] > 0;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(stoneGame([5, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: true
```

## Explanation:
1. We initialize a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve over Bob when considering the subarray `piles[i..j]`.
2. Initially, when `i == j`, `dp[i][i]` is just the value of `piles[i]` since there's only one pile to take.
3. We fill the DP table such that for subarrays of increasing lengths, we take the maximum difference Alice can achieve by either choosing the leftmost or rightmost pile and subtracting Bob's optimal response.
4. Finally, if `dp[0][n-1]` (the difference in scores considering the entire array) is greater than 0, Alice is guaranteed to win.

## Time Complexity:
- The overall time complexity of the above approach is O(n^2), where `n` is the size of the piles array, since it involves filling a 2D array based on subarray lengths.
- Space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the `dp` array.
