[Leetcode 2151. Maximum Good People Based on Statements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2151)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` people where each person is represented by an integer index from 0 to n-1. Each person has made a statement about every other person that represents either:

- 0: bad
- 1: good
- 2: no comment

Statements are in the form of a 2D array `statements` where `statements[i][j]` indicates what the ith person says about the jth person. Note:

- `statements[i][i]` is always 2, denote no self-comment.
 
A group is good if every good person always tells the truth.

Return the maximum number of good people one can have if we can assume a consistent relationship between the statements made.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume the length of the `statements` array will always be `n x n`?
   - Yes

2. Will it always be possible to form at least one valid group of good people?
   - Not necessarily; the problem is to find the maximum good people while maintaining consistency in the statements.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} statements
 * @return {number}
 */
function maximumGood(statements) {
    let n = statements.length;
    let maxGood = 0;

    function isValid(config) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (config[i] === 1) {
                for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if ((statements[i][j] === 0 && config[j] === 1) || 
                        (statements[i][j] === 1 && config[j] === 0)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    for (let mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        let config = Array(n).fill(0);
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) !== 0) {
                config[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (isValid(config)) {
            maxGood = Math.max(maxGood, config.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0));
        }
    }

    return maxGood;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Bitmasking Approach**: Use a bitmask to represent different configurations of good (`1`) and bad (`0`) people.
2. **Configuration Validation**: For each bitmask configuration, validate whether all statements are consistent under that configuration.
3. **Max Good Calculation**: Track and return the maximum number of good people observed in valid configurations.

## Time Complexity

- **Bitmasking Loop**: The loop runs for all possible configurations of the people, which is \(2^n\).
- **Configuration Check**: Each configuration check runs in \(O(n^2)\) time for validating all pairs of people.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)\).

This approach is feasible for small values of `n` but will struggle for large values due to its exponential nature with respect to `n`.
