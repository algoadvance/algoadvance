[Leetcode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l300)
### Problem Statement
The problem "Longest Increasing Subsequence" from LeetCode asks you to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given array of integers.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the subsequence required to be contiguous?**
    - No, the subsequence does not have to be contiguous.
2. **What is the range of the input size?**
    - The array length can be in the range `[1, 2500]`.
3. **What is the range of array values?**
    - The values in the array can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

### Strategy
There are multiple ways we can approach this problem, but an efficient one combines dynamic programming (DP) with binary search:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (O(n^2)):**
    - Initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with `nums[i]`.
    - For each `i`, iterate through all indices `j` before `i` (i.e., `0` to `i-1`) to find elements smaller than `nums[i]` and update `dp[i]`.
    - The final result will be the maximum value in `dp`.

2. **Binary Search + Dynamic Programming (O(n log n)):**
    - Utilize a list `lis` to keep our current longest subsequence.
    - For each number in `nums`, use binary search to determine its position in the `lis` list and replace or append accordingly.

Here we will use the more efficient binary search approach:

### Code 
```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let lis = [];
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        let left = 0, right = lis.length;
        
        while (left < right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (lis[mid] < num) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        if (left < lis.length) {
            lis[left] = num;
        } else {
            lis.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    return lis.length;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18];
console.log(lengthOfLIS(nums)); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty list `lis` that will store the smallest ending elements of the increasing subsequences of different lengths found so far.
2. **Binary Search:** For each element `num` in `nums`, perform a binary search in `lis` to find the position (`left`) where `num` should be placed.
    - If `left` is within the bounds of `lis`, replace `lis[left]` with `num` (this maintains the smallest possible number for the subsequence length `left + 1`).
    - If `left` equals the length of `lis`, it means `num` can extend the current longest subsequence, so append it to `lis`.
3. **Result:** The length of `lis` at the end represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)`
- **For each number**: `O(n)`

Combining these, the overall time complexity for this approach is `O(n log n)`, making it efficient for the given input constraints.
