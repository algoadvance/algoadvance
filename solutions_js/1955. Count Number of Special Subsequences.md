[Leetcode 1955. Count Number of Special Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1955)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, a special subsequence is a subsequence that can be represented as `[0, 1, 2]` where `0` must appear before `1` which must appear before `2`. Note that a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Return the number of different special subsequences modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:

- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: nums = [0,1,2,2]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The special subsequences are [0,1,2], [0,1,2] and [0,1,2,2]
  ```

- Example 2:
  ```
  Input: nums = [2,2,0,0]
  Output: 0
  Explanation: There are no special subsequences in [2,2,0,0].
  ```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 2`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array `nums` contain elements other than 0, 1, or 2?
   - No, according to the constraints, the elements of `nums` can only be 0, 1, or 2.

2. Are there any specific memory or performance constraints to consider other than the given constraint on `nums.length`?
   - Nothing specific beyond the sequence length constraint of up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can maintain three variables:
- `count0`: Number of ways to form subsequences ending with `0`
- `count1`: Number of ways to form subsequences ending with `1`
- `count2`: Number of ways to form subsequences ending with `2`

We iterate through the array and update these counts based on the current value:
- For each `0`, it can start a new subsequence or extend previous counts of subsequences ending with `0`.
- For each `1`, it can extend all subsequences formed by `count0`.
- For each `2`, it can extend all subsequences formed by `count1`.

Finally, `count2` will give the number of special subsequences.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const countSpecialSubsequences = (nums) => {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    let count0 = 0, count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) {
            count0 = (count0 * 2 + 1) % MOD;
        } else if (num === 1) {
            count1 = (count1 * 2 + count0) % MOD;
        } else if (num === 2) {
            count2 = (count2 * 2 + count1) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return count2;
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with all counts `count0`, `count1`, `count2` set to `0`.
2. **Iterate through `nums`**:
    - If `num` is `0`: A subsequence ending with `0` can be doubled by adding the current `0` to each existing subsequence ending with `0` and including this `0` as a single-element subsequence.
    - If `num` is `1`: A subsequence ending with `1` can be updated to include all subsequences ending with `0` and doubled by adding the current `1` to each existing subsequence ending with `1`.
    - If `num` is `2`: A subsequence ending with `2` can be updated to include all subsequences ending with `1` and doubled by adding the current `2` to each existing subsequence ending with `2`.
3. **Result**: Return `count2`, which contains the number of special subsequences.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array once and perform constant-time operations within each iteration.
