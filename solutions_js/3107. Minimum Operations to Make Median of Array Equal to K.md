[Leetcode 3107. Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3107)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted. If the size of the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. In order to make the median of `nums` equal to `k`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an element from the array and change it to any integer value.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?
2. **Value Range**: Is there any limit on the values of the elements in the array `nums` or the integer `k`?
3. **Odd and Even Lengths**: Are there any special considerations for arrays with odd or even lengths?
4. **Initial Checks**: Should we check if the current median is already `k`?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array to easily find the median.
2. **Identify Median Position**: Determine the position of the median in a sorted array.
   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the array length is even, choose either middle element since they average to the same value.
3. **Operations Count**: Calculate necessary operations:
   - Replace the median element with `k`.
4. **Return the Result**: The result will be the count of operations needed.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
const minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualToK = (nums, k) => {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const medianIndex = Math.floor(nums.length / 2);
    
    if (nums[medianIndex] !== k) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualToK([1, 2, 3], 2)); // Output: 0
console.log(minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualToK([3, 5, 1, 7], 6)); // Output: 1
console.log(minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualToK([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Finding Median**: Accessing the median element takes `O(1)` time.
3. **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

This solution ensures the minimum number of operations to make the median equal to `k`, using efficient sorting and indexing techniques.
