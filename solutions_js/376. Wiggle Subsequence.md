[Leetcode 376. Wiggle Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l376)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence. 

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(7-1)=[+6]`, `(4-7)=[-3]`, `(9-4)=[+5]`, `(2-9)=[-7]`, and `(5-2)=[+3]` alternate between positive and negative.

Example 1:
- Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
- Output: 6

Example 2:
- Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
- Output: 7

Example 3:
- Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- Output: 2

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
2. Is the sequence conventionally assumed to always start with the first element?
3. Can the input array be empty or contain only one element?

These are important to ensure proper handling of edge cases.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Check**: If `nums` has fewer than two elements, return the length of `nums`.
2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `up`: Represents the length of longest wiggle subsequence ending with a positive difference.
   - `down`: Represents the length of longest wiggle subsequence ending with a negative difference.
3. **Traverse the Array**:
   - For each element in the array (starting from the second one), update `up` and `down` based on whether the current difference is positive or negative.
4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value between `up` and `down`.

## Code
```javascript
function wiggleMaxLength(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2) return nums.length;

    let up = 1, down = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            up = down + 1;
        } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            down = up + 1;
        }
    }

    return Math.max(up, down);
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The algorithm iterates through the list once to compute the result, making it linear in terms of time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, as we are using constant space for the variables `up` and `down`.
