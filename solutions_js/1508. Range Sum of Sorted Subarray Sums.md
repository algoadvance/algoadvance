[Leetcode 1508. Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1508)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `n` and `left`, `right`. You need to calculate and return the sum of the numbers from the `left`-th smallest to the `right`-th smallest sum of subarrays in non-decreasing order since the sum should be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `nums`?**
   - For example, the length of the array, and the range of values it might contain?
   
2. **What is the range for `left` and `right`?**
   - How large can these values be compared to the length of `nums`?

3. **Do we need to account for subarrays of all sizes?**
   - For clarity, should the subarrays considered range from size 1 to the length of `nums`?

4. **Is it guaranteed that `left` and `right` are within bounds of the total number of subarrays possible?**
   
Here, assuming typical constraints from similar problems:
- `n` can be up to 1000,
- The values in `nums` can be any integer within the range `-10^4` to `10^4`,
- `left` and `right` are valid indices within the bounds of summed subarrays sorted.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Subarray Sums:**
   - Compute the sum for every subarray within the array. This will involve O(n^2) operations.

2. **Sort the Subarray Sums:**
   - Once all sums are generated, sort them in non-decreasing order.

3. **Sum the Required Range:**
   - Sum the values from the `left`-th smallest sum to the `right`-th smallest sum.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Ensure the result is modulo `10^9 + 7` as specified.

### Code

```javascript
function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    let subarraySums = [];

    // Generate all subarray sums
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            sum += nums[j];
            subarraySums.push(sum);
        }
    }

    // Sort the sums
    subarraySums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Calculate the sum from left to right (1-indexed)
    let result = 0;
    for (let k = left - 1; k < right; k++) {
        result = (result + subarraySums[k]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(rangeSum([1, 2, 3, 4], 4, 1, 5)); // Output: 13
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Generating Subarray Sums:** O(n^2)
   - Nested loops through the array to generate all subarray sums.
   
2. **Sorting Subarray Sums:** O(n^2 log n^2)
   - The number of possible subarrays is O(n^2), and sorting them will require O(n^2 log n^2) time due to the sorting algorithm.

3. **Summing the Range:** O(k)
   - Summing `k` elements where k = `right - left + 1`.

The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in O(n^2 log n^2). While this can be intense, it's feasible given typical constraints in competitive programming.
