[Leetcode 992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l992)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, call a (contiguous, not necessarily distinct) subarray of `nums` good if the number of different integers in that subarray is exactly `K`.

Return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], K = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,3].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints and Size:**
   - What is the range of the array size `n`?
     - A: The length of the array can be up to 50,000.
   - What is the range of values for `nums[i]`?
     - A: Each element in `nums` will be a positive integer where `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`.
   - What is the range of `K`?
     - A: `1 <= K <= nums.length`

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle the smallest input case, e.g., `nums = [1], K = 1`?
   - A: The function should be able to handle and return correct result for such cases seamlessly.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the "sliding window" (or two-pointer) technique. The idea is to maintain two sliding windows:
1. One for subarrays with at most `K` different integers.
2. One for subarrays with at most `K-1` different integers.

The number of subarrays with exactly `K` different integers is the difference between the number of subarrays with at most `K` different integers and the number of subarrays with at most `K-1` different integers.

#### Steps:
1. Implement a helper function `atMostK` to count the number of subarrays with at most `K` different integers.
2. Use this helper function to find the count for `K` and `K-1`.
3. Return the difference.

### Code

```javascript
function subarraysWithKDistinct(nums, K) {
    function atMostK(k) {
        let count = new Map();
        let left = 0;
        let res = 0;
        
        for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            count.set(nums[right], (count.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
            
            while (count.size > k) {
                count.set(nums[left], count.get(nums[left]) - 1);
                if (count.get(nums[left]) === 0) {
                    count.delete(nums[left]);
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            res += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    return atMostK(K) - atMostK(K - 1);
}

// Example Usage
let nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3];
let K = 2;
console.log(subarraysWithKDistinct(nums, K));  // Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the `atMostK` function is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Since we call this function twice (for `K` and `K-1`), the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n + n) which simplifies to O(n).

This solution is efficient and should handle the upper constraint limits effectively.
