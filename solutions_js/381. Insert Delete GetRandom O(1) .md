[Leetcode 381. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l381)
## Problem Statement

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time, even when duplicates are allowed:

1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item `val` to the collection.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item `val` from the collection if present.
3. `getRandom()`: Returns a random element from the current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same value the collection contains.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in the collection guaranteed to be integers?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the elements are integers.
   
2. **What should the behavior be if `remove(val)` is called on a value not in the collection?**
   - If `remove(val)` is called on a value not present, it should not change the collection and should still support constant-time operations.

3. **Is the collection possibly very large?**
   - Yes, the collection can grow large, so our operations should be efficient in both time and space.

## Strategy

To achieve O(1) average time complexity for each operation, we can combine the use of a hash map and an array. Here's the detailed strategy for each method:

1. `insert(val)`: 
   - Append `val` to an array.
   - Use a hash map where the key is the value and the value is a set of indices in the array where the value is located.

2. `remove(val)`:
   - If `val` is not in the hash map, do nothing.
   - Otherwise, get an index of `val` from the hash map.
   - Swap this element with the last element in the array.
   - Remove the last element of the array.
   - Update the hash map accordingly.

3. `getRandom()`:
   - Simply return a random element from the array using a random index.

This data structure ensures that both insertion and deletion are O(1) operations because both the hash map and the list allow for efficient indexing and updating.

## Code

```javascript
class RandomizedCollection {
    constructor() {
        this.vals = [];
        this.indexMap = new Map();
    }

    insert(val) {
        if (!this.indexMap.has(val)) {
            this.indexMap.set(val, new Set());
        }
        this.indexMap.get(val).add(this.vals.length);
        this.vals.push(val);
        return true;
    }

    remove(val) {
        if (!this.indexMap.has(val) || this.indexMap.get(val).size === 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        const indexToRemove = this.indexMap.get(val).values().next().value;
        const lastVal = this.vals[this.vals.length - 1];
        this.vals[indexToRemove] = lastVal;
        
        this.indexMap.get(val).delete(indexToRemove);
        if (indexToRemove !== this.vals.length - 1) {
            this.indexMap.get(lastVal).delete(this.vals.length - 1);
            this.indexMap.get(lastVal).add(indexToRemove);
        }
        
        this.vals.pop();
        if (this.indexMap.get(val).size === 0) {
            this.indexMap.delete(val);
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    getRandom() {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.vals.length);
        return this.vals[randomIndex];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- `insert(val)`: Average O(1) - appending to an array and adding to a hash set both take constant time.
- `remove(val)`: Average O(1) - locating an index, swapping elements, and updating hash maps are all average O(1) operations.
- `getRandom()`: O(1) - accessing an array element by index is an O(1) operation.

This implementation ensures that all operations are average O(1) as required by the problem statement.
