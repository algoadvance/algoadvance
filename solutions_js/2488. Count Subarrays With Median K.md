[Leetcode 2488. Count Subarrays With Median K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2488)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`. A subarray is called a Median K-out if the median of the subarray is `k`. You need to find the number of such subarrays.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of median?**
   - The median is the middle value of the sorted numbers or the average of the two middle numbers when the array length is even.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes.

3. **Do we need to consider only contiguous subarrays?**
   - Yes, a subarray must be continuous.

4. **Is the subarray length fixed?**
   - No, it can be of any length but must be contiguous.

## Code
Here is the code that solves the problem:

```javascript
function countSubarrays(nums, k) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let kPosition = -1;

    // Find the position of k in the array
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === k) {
            kPosition = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (kPosition === -1) {
        return 0; // If k is not in nums, return 0
    }

    let balance = 0;
    let count = { 0: 1 }; // Initialize with balance 0 having 1 frequency
    let result = 0;

    // Calculate balance for the right part including k
    for (let i = kPosition; i < n; i++) {
        balance += (nums[i] > k) ? 1 : (nums[i] < k) ? -1 : 0;

        // Calculate number of valid subarrays where balance is (0 or -1)
        if (count[balance]) {
            result += count[balance];
        }
        if (count[balance - 1]) {
            result += count[balance - 1];
        }
    }

    balance = 0; // Reset balance for counting left part
    count = { 0: 1 }; // Reinitialize count for the left part with 0 balance having 1 frequency
    
    // Calculate balance for the left part excluding k
    for (let i = kPosition - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        balance += (nums[i] > k) ? 1 : (nums[i] < k) ? -1 : 0;
        
        if (count[balance]) {
            count[balance]++;
        } else {
            count[balance] = 1;
        }
    }

    balance = 0; // Reset balance for final count augmentation
    for (let i = kPosition; i < n; i++) {
        balance += (nums[i] > k) ? 1 : 0;
        let oppositeBalance = count[-balance] || 0;
        let oppositeBalanceMinusOne = count[-balance - 1] || 0;
        result += oppositeBalance + oppositeBalanceMinusOne;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Identify the Position of `k`:** Scan through the array once to find the index where `k` is located.
2. **Score Subarray Using Balance:** Create a system to balance subarray values based on their relation to `k`. Increase the balance if the value is greater than `k`, decrease if itâ€™s lesser.
3. **Utilize Counting:** Implement a dictionary to count different balance values to efficiently calculate how many subarrays have a median of `k`.
4. **Separate Counting for Right and Left:** Balance counts are calculated separately for indices right of and including `k`, and left of `k`.
5. **Match and Calculate Possible Subarrays:** Combine the separate counts to get the result.

## Time Complexity
- The solution involves scanning the array multiple times with processes that are linear in nature.
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
