[Leetcode 1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1806)
## Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

You are given an even integer `n`. You start with the permutation `perm = [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]` of size `n`.

In one operation, you create a new array `arr`, and for each `i`:

- If `i % 2 == 0`, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- If `i % 2 == 1`, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

You then assign `arr` to `perm`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to reinitialize the permutation `perm` to its original state.

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few details about the problem:
1. **Range of `n`:** What are the expected constraints on `n`? 
2. **Expected Output:** Confirm that the output is the minimum number of operations to revert back to the initial permutation.
3. **Initial Permutation:** Confirm that the process always starts with the initial permutation `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]`.

Assuming the constraints are standard for competitive programming (with `n` typically up to \(10^4\) or more), let's proceed with designing the strategy.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with the permutation `perm = [0, 1, ... , n-1]`.
2. **Simulation:** Simulate the reinitialization process iteratively until `perm` returns to `[0, 1, ... , n-1]`.
3. **Counter:** Count the number of operations needed.
4. **Termination Condition:** Stop when `perm` matches the initial permutation.

### Simulation Details:

- Utilize a loop where we form `arr` based on the given rules and then update `perm` with `arr`.
- Track the number of operations necessary.

### Edge Cases:
- Ensure `n` is even as specified.

Here's the implementation plan:

## Code

```javascript
var reinitializePermutation = function(n) {
    let perm = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i); // Initialize perm [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
    const original = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i); // Keep a copy of the original permutation
    let arr = new Array(n); // Temporary array for transformations
    let operations = 0;

    while (true) {
        operations++;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 === 0) {
                arr[i] = perm[i / 2];
            } else {
                arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + Math.floor((i - 1) / 2)];
            }
        }
        // Update perm with the new arrangement in arr
        perm = [...arr]; 
        
        // Check for reinitialization
        if (perm.every((value, index) => value === original[index])) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return operations;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization Cost:** Initializing the arrays takes \(O(n)\).
- **Simulation Cost:** In each operation, updating `perm` takes \(O(n)\), and checking if `perm` matches `original` also takes \(O(n)\).
- **Operation Loop Cost:** Assuming the worst-case scenario requires \(O(n)\) operations (though in practice, it will usually be significantly less).

Overall Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\) in a pessimistic view, but likely \(O(n \cdot k)\) for some small k in a typical case.

Thus, the strategy and code efficiently solve the problem within the expected constraints.
