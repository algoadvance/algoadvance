[Leetcode 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1493)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length range of the input array `nums`?
    - The length can range from 1 to 10^5.
2. Should I consider edge cases like all 0's or all 1's?
    - Yes, consider these edge cases: if the array consists of all 0's, deleting one element will not convert any subarray to 1's. If all 1's, the result should be the length of the array minus one.

## Strategy

1. Use the sliding window technique to find the longest subarray of 1's possible after deleting one element.
2. Maintain two pointers `left` and `right` to define the sliding window.
3. Count the number of zeros within the current window using a counter `zeroCount`.
4. Move the `right` pointer to expand the window. If a zero is encountered, increment `zeroCount`.
5. When `zeroCount` exceeds 1, move the `left` pointer to the right until `zeroCount` is no more than 1.
6. Calculate the size of the current window and update the maximum length accordingly.
7. Return the maximum length found.

## Code

```javascript
function longestSubarray(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let zeroCount = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    while (right < nums.length) {
        if (nums[right] === 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        }

        while (zeroCount > 1) {
            if (nums[left] === 0) {
                zeroCount--;
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Length of the window minus one element (since one element is to be deleted)
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
        right++;
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above code is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the code is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
