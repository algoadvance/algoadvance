[Leetcode 2424. Longest Uploaded Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2424)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a stream of videos, each represented by a unique ID starting from `1` to `n`. Implement a system that tracks the longest prefix of consecutive videos that have been uploaded so far.

**Your task is to implement the `LUPrefix` class:**

1. `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object for `n` videos.
2. `void upload(int video)` Uploads `video` into your list of uploaded videos.
3. `int longest()` Returns the length of the longest prefix of consecutive uploaded videos.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the maximum value of `n`?
   - This impacts memory usage considerations and helps in choosing the right data structure.
   
2. **Order of Uploads**: Are the video uploads always in increasing order of their IDs?
   - This guides how we track the longest prefix.

3. **Duplicate Uploads**: Can a video be uploaded more than once, and if so, should it affect the system?
   - This impacts the upload logic and data structures.

4. **Performance Requirements**: Are there any performance constraints on the methods, particularly `upload` and `longest`?

Assuming the problem is straightforward with reasonable constraints and the videos will be uniquely uploaded in any order:

### Strategy:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use an array `uploaded` to keep track of which videos are uploaded. The index of the array represents the video ID (offset by 1 because IDs start from 1).
   - Use a variable `maxPrefix` to keep the longest sequence of consecutive videos starting from `1`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an array of size `n+1` (with `0` as a dummy value at index 0).

3. **Upload Video**:
   - Mark the video as uploaded in the array.
   - Update `maxPrefix` if consecutive videos from `1` to `k` are all uploaded.

4. **Get Longest Prefix**:
   - Return the value of `maxPrefix`.

Doing this should give `O(1)` time complexity for both `upload` and `longest`.

### Code:

```javascript
class LUPrefix {
    constructor(n) {
        this.uploaded = new Array(n + 1).fill(false); // index 0 is unused
        this.maxPrefix = 0;
    }

    upload(video) {
        this.uploaded[video] = true;

        // Update maxPrefix if the next video in sequence is uploaded
        while (this.maxPrefix + 1 < this.uploaded.length && this.uploaded[this.maxPrefix + 1]) {
            this.maxPrefix++;
        }
    }

    longest() {
        return this.maxPrefix;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization (`LUPrefix`)**: `O(n)` due to array creation and initialization.
- **Upload (`upload`)**: `O(1)` amortized, assuming `maxPrefix` updates in a single pass.
- **Get Longest Prefix (`longest`)**: `O(1)`.

The approach efficiently maintains and checks the longest prefix of uploaded videos, ensuring quick responses for uploads and prefix queries.
