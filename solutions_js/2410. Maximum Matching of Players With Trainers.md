[Leetcode 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2410)
### Problem Statement
[LeetCode 2410: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/)

You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers`. The `players[i]` represents the skill level of the `i-th` player, and `trainers[j]` represents the skill level of the `j-th` trainer.

Each player can be matched with at most one trainer, and each trainer can be matched with at most one player. A player and a trainer can only be matched if the player's skill level is less than or equal to the trainer's skill level.

Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the arrays have duplicated values?**
   - Yes, both `players` and `trainers` arrays can have duplicated values.
2. **Are the arrays always non-empty?**
   - The problem does not explicitly state that the arrays are always non-empty, so we should handle empty arrays gracefully, although matching in such cases would be 0.
3. **What are the possible ranges of array lengths?**
   - The length of the arrays is within the range `[0, 10^5]`.

### Strategy
1. **Sort Both Arrays:** Start by sorting both `players` and `trainers` arrays. This will allow us to use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum matching.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:** Use two pointers, one for the `players` array and one for the `trainers` array. Initialize both pointers at the start of each array.
3. **Iterate and Match:** Traverse through both arrays simultaneously. For each player, if there is a trainer who can match (trainer's skill level >= player's skill level), increment the matching count and move both pointers forward. If not, just move the trainer's pointer forward.
4. **End Condition:** Continue until we have processed all players or all trainers.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} players
 * @param {number[]} trainers
 * @return {number}
 */
var matchPlayersAndTrainers = function(players, trainers) {
    // Sort both arrays
    players.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    trainers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let i = 0, j = 0, matched = 0;

    // Use two pointers to find the maximum matching
    while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
        if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
            matched++;
            i++;
            j++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }

    return matched;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sorting step for both `players` and `trainers` arrays takes `O(N log N + M log M)` where `N` is the number of players and `M` is the number of trainers.
- **Matching:** The matching process using the two-pointer technique takes `O(N + M)` because we are traversing both arrays at most once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N log N + M log M)`.
