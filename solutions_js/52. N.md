[Leetcode 52. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l52)
## Problem Statement

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
    - Typically, `1 <= n <= 9`.
   
2. **What does it mean for queens to attack each other?**
    - Queens attack each other if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

3. **Do we need to return the actual arrangements of the queens?**
    - No, we only need to return the number of distinct solutions.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking approach:**
    - Use backtracking to explore all possible ways to place queens.
    - Ensure that no queens attack each other by tracking columns and diagonals.
    
2. **Track invalid positions:**
   - Use sets to track columns, `left_diagonals` (defined by row - col) and `right_diagonals` (defined by row + col) that are under attack.
   
3. **Recursive function:**
   - Create a function that takes the current row and places a queen if it's safe.
   - If all queens are placed (i.e., when the row equals `n`), count this as a valid solution.
   - Backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next possible position.

## Code

```javascript
function totalNQueens(n) {
    let solutions = 0;

    function solve(row, cols, leftDiags, rightDiags) {
        if (row === n) {
            solutions++;
            return;
        }

        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (cols.has(col) || leftDiags.has(row - col) || rightDiags.has(row + col)) {
                continue;
            }

            cols.add(col);
            leftDiags.add(row - col);
            rightDiags.add(row + col);

            solve(row + 1, cols, leftDiags, rightDiags);

            cols.delete(col);
            leftDiags.delete(row - col);
            rightDiags.delete(row + col);
        }
    }

    solve(0, new Set(), new Set(), new Set());
    return solutions;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the N-Queens problem is generally O(N!), where N is the size of the board. This is because we are generating every possible position for the queens and then validating it:

1. **Placement of Queens:**
    - Place 1 queen in `n` possible ways in the first row.
    - Place the 2nd queen in `n-1` possible ways in the second row.
    - And so on, leading to `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1` = O(N!) time complexity.

## Conclusion

The provided code effectively solves the N-Queens II problem using a backtracking approach while ensuring that no queens attack each other. The combination of sets to keep track of columns and diagonals helps in efficiently pruning the search space, leading to accurate and efficient computation of the number of distinct solutions.
