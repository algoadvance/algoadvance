### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

**Constraints:**
- 2 <= n <= 58

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `n` a positive integer?**
   - Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.

2. **Is there a limit to the size of `n`?**
   - Yes, `n` has a limit where `2 <= n <= 58`.

3. **Can we use mathematical properties or dynamic programming to enhance the performance?**
   - Yes, using mathematical properties or dynamic programming can optimize the solution.

### Strategy

To maximize the product of integers summing to `n`, we leverage a mathematical insight:

1. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - When breaking down the integer `n`, the numbers 1 and 2 are not ideal as factors for maximizing the product (except when `n = 2` or `n = 3`).
   - The number 3 is the most critical component to maximize the product. Thus, to maximize the product, we should decompose `n` into as many 3’s as possible while considering the remainders.

2. **Steps:**
   - If `n = 2` or `n = 3`, return `n - 1`, as they are the edge cases.
   - For general cases, keep breaking down `n` into parts that are divisible by 3, and handle any remaining parts (like when the remainder is 1 or 2).

   Let's go ahead and implement this strategy.

### Code

```javascript
const integerBreak = (n) => {
    // Base cases:
    if (n === 2) return 1;
    if (n === 3) return 2;

    // General case:
    let product = 1;
    while (n > 4) {
        product *= 3;
        n -= 3;
    }

    // Remaining part will be 2, 3, or 4; as above conditions ensure n <= 6
    return product * n;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(integerBreak(2));  // Output: 1
console.log(integerBreak(10)); // Output: 36
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n/3) which simplifies to O(n). However, practical computations will be constant time for reasonable bounds of `n` given the limited range up to 58.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a few variables for computation and do not utilize any significant extra space.

This approach ensures an optimized and efficient solution to the problem by leveraging mathematical insights on breaking down the number in a way that maximizes the product.
