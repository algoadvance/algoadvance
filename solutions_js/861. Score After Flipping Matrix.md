[Leetcode 861. Score After Flipping Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l861)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary matrix A with dimensions `R x C`. The matrix can only contain 0s and 1s. You can perform two types of operations on the matrix any number of times:

1. Flip any row (i.e., turn all 0s in the row to 1s and all 1s to 0s).
2. Flip any column (i.e., turn all 0s in the column to 1s and all 1s to 0s).

The score of the matrix is the sum of the binary numbers represented by the rows. The objective is to maximize the score of the matrix.

Write a function `matrixScore` that takes a binary matrix A and returns the highest possible score after flipping the matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the dimensions R and C?**
    - There is no explicit range given, but usually, it will be within manageable limits for typical competitive programming constraints.

2. **Can the matrix be empty?**
    - No, the matrix will always have at least one row and one column.

3. **Are the individual binary elements strictly 0 or 1?**
    - Yes, the matrix will only contain binary elements 0 or 1.

4. **What should be the output format?**
    - The output should be a single integer, representing the maximum possible score.

### Strategy

To maximize the score of the matrix, consider these steps:

1. Ensure that the most significant bit (i.e., the first column of the matrix) of each row is 1. This is because having a 1 in the most significant position maximizes the value of the binary number.
    - This can be achieved by flipping any row that has a 0 in the first column.
2. After ensuring the first column has all 1s, maximize the number of 1s in the other columns. For each column (from the second to the last):
    - Count the number of 1s and 0s.
    - If the number of 0s is greater than the number of 1s, flip that column to maximize the number of 1s.

### Code

```javascript
function matrixScore(A) {
    let R = A.length, C = A[0].length;
    
    // Step 1: Ensure first column has all 1s
    for (let i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
        if (A[i][0] === 0) {
            for (let j = 0; j < C; ++j) {
                A[i][j] ^= 1; // Flip the row
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Maximize the number of 1s in each column
    for (let j = 1; j < C; ++j) {
        let oneCount = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
            if (A[i][j] === 1) {
                oneCount++;
            }
        }
        
        if (oneCount < R - oneCount) { // More 0s than 1s in this column
            for (let i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
                A[i][j] ^= 1; // Flip the column
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the score
    let score = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < R; ++i) {
        let rowValue = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < C; ++j) {
            rowValue = rowValue * 2 + A[i][j];
        }
        score += rowValue;
    }

    return score;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Flipping a row involves R (rows) iterations and each row flip is O(C).
- Flipping a column involves R iterations and each column flip is O(R).
- Calculating the score is O(R * C) because you need to process each element once.

Overall, this algorithm runs in O(R * C), making it efficient for typical matrix dimensions in competitive programming.
