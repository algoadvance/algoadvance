[Leetcode 946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l946)
## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, you need to check whether this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000`
- All the elements of `pushed` and `popped` are distinct.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if one of the arrays is empty? 
   - Since the lengths of both arrays are the same, if one is empty, the other must also be empty. Hence, the answer should be `true` because no push or pop operations were performed.

2. Is there any constraint on the time complexity or space complexity of the solution?
   - While no explicit constraints are given beyond those provided, a linear time complexity (O(n)) solution is feasible given the array lengths.

## Strategy
The key to solving this problem is to simulate the push and pop operations using an auxiliary stack. We'll try to push elements from the `pushed` array onto the stack, and at each step, we'll check if the top of the stack matches the next element in the `popped` array. If it does, we'll pop the stack and move to the next element in the `popped` array. If, at the end, the stack is empty and all elements in `popped` have been correctly matched, then the sequences are valid.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize an empty stack and an index `j` to track the position in the `popped` array.
2. Iterate through each element in the `pushed` array and push it onto the stack.
3. After each push operation, while the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is equal to the current element in `popped[j]`, pop the stack and increment `j`.
4. After processing all elements, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Code

```javascript
function validateStackSequences(pushed, popped) {
    let stack = [];
    let j = 0; // index for popped array

    for (let x of pushed) {
        stack.push(x); // simulate push operation
        // simulate pop operation
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === popped[j]) {
            stack.pop();
            j++;
        }
    }

    // If the stack is empty, all elements have been matched correctly
    return stack.length === 0;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(validateStackSequences([1,2,3,4,5], [4,5,3,2,1])); // true
console.log(validateStackSequences([1,2,3,4,5], [4,3,5,1,2])); // false
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above approach is O(n), where n is the length of the `pushed` (or `popped`) array. This is because the while loop at most will pop every element that is ever pushed.

The space complexity is also O(n) due to the extra stack used to simulate the push and pop operations.
