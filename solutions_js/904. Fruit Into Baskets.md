[Leetcode 904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l904)
### Problem Statement

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `i-th` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules:

1. You have only two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
2. You can select any subarray of the fruit's row and you need to collect the maximum number of fruits possible in that subarray.

The goal is to find the maximum number of fruits you can collect in two baskets.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].

Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].

Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].

Input: fruits = [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the fruits array ever be empty? If so, what should the function return in that case?
2. Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
3. Can the length of the given array be extremely large?

### Strategy
This problem can be solved efficiently using a sliding window approach. The main idea is to maintain a dynamic window that satisfies the condition of containing at most two distinct types of fruits. 

1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` both set to the beginning of the array and use a hashmap to keep track of the count of each fruit type in the current window.
2. Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and add the fruit to the hashmap.
3. If the number of different fruit types in the hashmap exceeds two, shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer and update the hashmap accordingly.
4. Track the maximum size of the window that contains at most two different types of fruits.

### Time Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array `fruits`. We traverse each element at most twice, once when expanding the window by moving the `right` pointer and once when contracting by moving the `left` pointer.
- Space complexity: O(1), as the hashmap will hold at most three keys regardless of the input size.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} fruits
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalFruit = function(fruits) {
    let maxFruits = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let fruitCount = new Map();

    for (let right = 0; right < fruits.length; right++) {
        // Add the fruit at the right pointer to the map
        fruitCount.set(fruits[right], (fruitCount.get(fruits[right]) || 0) + 1);

        // Check if we have more than 2 types of fruits
        while (fruitCount.size > 2) {
            // Remove the fruit at the left pointer
            fruitCount.set(fruits[left], fruitCount.get(fruits[left]) - 1);
            if (fruitCount.get(fruits[left]) === 0) {
                fruitCount.delete(fruits[left]);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Calculate the maximum fruits we can collect
        maxFruits = Math.max(maxFruits, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxFruits;
};
```
This solution efficiently uses the sliding window technique along with a hashmap to manage the counts of fruits and ensure the window contains at most two distinct types of fruits.
