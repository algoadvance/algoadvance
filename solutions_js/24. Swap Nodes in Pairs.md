[Leetcode 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l24)
### Problem Statement

You are given a linked list, and your task is to swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

For example:
- Given `head = [1,2,3,4]`, return `[2,1,4,3]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the linked list is empty (i.e., `head` is `null`)?**
   - If the linked list is empty, simply return `null`.

2. **What happens when there is only one node in the list?**
   - If there is only one node, the list remains unchanged, and the single node should be returned.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We will use a dummy node to handle edge cases easily, like when the linked list has less than two nodes.
2. **Iteration**: We'll iterate through the list in pairs. For each pair of nodes we encounter, we'll swap their connections.
3. **Termination**: Once we reach the end of the list or there's only one node left that can't form a pair, we terminate the iteration.

### Steps

1. Create a `dummy` node and set its next pointer to the head of the list.
2. Initialize a `current` pointer to the dummy node. This pointer helps in managing the node swaps.
3. Iterate through the list while ensuring that there are at least two nodes to swap.
4. Perform the swap of the node pairs.
5. Move the `current` pointer two nodes ahead.
6. Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the swapped list.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the linked list, because we are visiting each node exactly once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a few extra pointers.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function swapPairs(head) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let current = dummy;
    
    while (current.next !== null && current.next.next !== null) {
        let first = current.next;
        let second = current.next.next;
        
        // Swapping the nodes
        first.next = second.next;
        second.next = first;
        current.next = second;
        
        // Move the current pointer ahead for the next pair
        current = first;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
}

// Example usage:
const head = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4))));
const newHead = swapPairs(head);

let current = newHead;
while (current != null) {
    console.log(current.val); // This should print 2, 1, 4, 3
    current = current.next;
}
```

Here, the function `swapPairs` efficiently swaps adjacent nodes in a linked list while maintaining a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)**. The provided code also includes an example usage to demonstrate how the function works with a sample linked list.
