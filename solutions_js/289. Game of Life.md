[Leetcode 289. Game of Life](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l289)
### Problem Statement

The "Game of Life" is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway.

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state (either `0` representing a dead cell or `1` representing a live cell). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid board, return the next state.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the board be modified in place, or is creating a copy allowed?**
   - We can modify in place, but we must not overwrite the current state until all cells have been processed.

2. **What to do if the matrix is empty?**
   - If the board is empty, simply return an empty grid.

3. **Constraints on the size of the board?**
   - The board will be within a manageable size as per problem constraints on LeetCode.

### Strategy

To solve this problem in place while avoiding overwriting issues, an effective technique is to use two-bit integers:
- Utilize the second bit to store the next state while the first bit keeps the current state.

For example:
- `0 (00 in binary)` -> Dead state now, dead state next.
- `1 (01 in binary)` -> Alive state now, dead state next.
- `2 (10 in binary)` -> Dead state now, alive state next.
- `3 (11 in binary)` -> Alive state now, alive state next.

After computing the next state for all cells, a quick pass through the board can update it to the next state.

### Code

```javascript
function gameOfLife(board) {
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;
    
    const directions = [
        [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1],
        [1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]
    ];
    
    const countLiveNeighbors = (r, c) => {
        let liveCount = 0;
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr;
            const nc = c + dc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && (board[nr][nc] & 1) === 1) {
                liveCount++;
            }
        }
        return liveCount;
    }
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            const liveNeighbors = countLiveNeighbors(r, c);
            
            if ((board[r][c] & 1) === 1) {
                if (liveNeighbors === 2 || liveNeighbors === 3) {
                    board[r][c] = 3; // 11 in binary
                }
            } else {
                if (liveNeighbors === 3) {
                    board[r][c] = 2; // 10 in binary
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            board[r][c] >>= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the board. This is because we process each cell twice: once for computing the next state and once for updating the board.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). The in-place modification ensures that no additional space is used apart from a few fixed-size variables.

This approach ensures that the board is updated efficiently according to the rules of the Game of Life.
