[Leetcode 336. Palindrome Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l336)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words`. A **palindrome pair** is a pair of integers `(i, j)` such that:

- 0 <= i, j < `words.length`
- `i != j`
- `words[i] + words[j]` is a palindrome

Your task is to return a list of all the palindrome pairs.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindrome pairs are:
["abcd","dcba"] => "abcddcba"
["dcba","abcd"] => "dcbaabcd"
["lls","s"] => "llss"
["s","lls"] => "slls"
["sssll",""] => "sssll" (Assuming empty string is a valid word in the list)
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be included in the result if there are no palindrome pairs?**
   - Return an empty list.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of individual strings and maximum number of strings in the list?**
   - Let's assume `words.length` can be up to 5000 and each string `words[i]` can have a length up to 300.

3. **Do we need to handle case sensitivity?**
   - No, the problem states that all characters are lowercase English letters.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number[][]}
*/
var palindromePairs = function(words) {
    let wordMap = new Map();
    let res = [];
    
    words.forEach((word, index) => wordMap.set(word, index));
    
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        const word = words[i];
        const wordLen = word.length;
        
        for (let j = 0; j <= wordLen; j++) {
            const left = word.slice(0, j);
            const right = word.slice(j);
            
            if (isPalindrome(left)) {
                const reversedRight = right.split('').reverse().join('');
                if (wordMap.has(reversedRight) && wordMap.get(reversedRight) !== i) {
                    res.push([wordMap.get(reversedRight), i]);
                }
            }
            
            if (isPalindrome(right) && right.length !== 0) {
                const reversedLeft = left.split('').reverse().join('');
                if (wordMap.has(reversedLeft) && wordMap.get(reversedLeft) !== i) {
                    res.push([i, wordMap.get(reversedLeft)]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return res;
};

var isPalindrome = function(str) {
    let left = 0, right = str.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (str[left] !== str[right]) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Map Creation**:
   - Create a hash map to store each word and its index for quick lookup.

2. **Split and Check**:
   - For each word in `words`, iterate through possible splits of the word.
   - For each possible split, check if either the left part or the right part is a palindrome.
   - Then, for the non-palindromic part, check if its reverse exists in the hash map.

3. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Create a helper function to check if a string is a palindrome.

4. **Result Assembly**:
   - Based on the checks, add corresponding indices to the result list if the conditions for forming a palindrome pair are met.

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity can be broken down as:

- **Hash Map Construction**: O(n), where n is the length of the words array.
- **Main Loop**: For each word (nested loop for all splits), the palindrome operations are linear in time, leading to:

    - `O(n * m^2)` where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of a word. This accounts for all splits and palindrome checks.

Thus, the time complexity is `O(n * m^2)`. This is efficient given the constraints, but keep in mind the large constants may affect performance.
