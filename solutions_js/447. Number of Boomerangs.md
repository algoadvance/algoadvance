[Leetcode 447. Number of Boomerangs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l447)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that `n` will be at most `500` and coordinates of points are all in the range `-10^4` to `10^4`.

**Input:**
- An array of points, where each point contains two integers representing the coordinates `[xi, yi]`.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the number of boomerangs.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can two points have the same coordinates?
   **A:** No, the problem states that all points are pairwise distinct.
   
2. **Q:** Can the list of points be empty?
   **A:** No, there will always be at least one point since `n` is at least 1.

These clarifications indicate we don't need to handle duplicate points or empty input arrays.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Boomerangs:** For a point `i`, find all pairs `(j, k)` such that the distance `d(i, j) == d(i, k)`.
2. **Distance Calculation:** Use Euclidean squared distance since we only need relative distances (avoid using square roots for efficiency): `d(i, j) = (xi - xj)^2 + (yi - yj)^2`.
3. **Distance Mapping:** Use a hash map to track the frequency of each distance from point `i` to other points.
4. **Counting Boomerangs:**
   - For each unique distance `d` found from point `i`, if `count` points are at this distance, then there are `count * (count - 1)` boomerangs, since point `i` can pair with any permutation of these points.
5. **Repeat for Each Point:** Repeat the above steps for each point in the list to accumulate the total number of boomerangs.

## Code

```javascript
function numberOfBoomerangs(points) {
    let boomerangs = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        let distanceMap = new Map();

        for (let j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
            if (i !== j) {
                let dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                let dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                let dist = dx * dx + dy * dy;

                if (distanceMap.has(dist)) {
                    distanceMap.set(dist, distanceMap.get(dist) + 1);
                } else {
                    distanceMap.set(dist, 1);
                }
            }
        }

        for (let count of distanceMap.values()) {
            boomerangs += count * (count - 1);
        }
    }

    return boomerangs;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfBoomerangs([[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]])); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Outer Loop:** Iterates through each point, so `O(n)`.
2. **Inner Loop:** For each point `i`, computes distances to all other points, so `O(n)`.
3. **Distance Mapping and Counting:** Filling the hash map and then iterating its values - Inner operations are `O(n)` for a single point.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`, which is efficient for `n <= 500`.
