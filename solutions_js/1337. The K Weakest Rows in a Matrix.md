[Leetcode 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1337)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians, that is, all the `1`'s will appear to the left of all the `0`'s in each row.

A row `i` is weaker than a row `j` if one of the following is true:
- The number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`.
- Both rows have the same number of soldiers and `i` is less than `j`.

Return the indices of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Bounds:** What are the possible values for `m` and `n`?
    - *Answer*: Typically, constraints will be given in the problem description on platforms like LeetCode.

2. **Elements in Matrix:** Can there be any element other than `0` and `1` in the matrix?
    - *Answer*: No, the matrix only contains `0` and `1`.

3. **Tie-breaking:** If two rows have the same number of soldiers, their order is determined by the row index, correct?
    - *Answer*: Yes, that's correct.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Soldiers:** For each row, count the number of soldiers.
2. **Pair and Sort:** Pair each row's index with its soldier count and sort these pairs.
3. **Extract Indices:** Extract the row indices of the first `k` elements from the sorted pairs.

### Code

Here's a step-by-step implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var kWeakestRows = function(mat, k) {
    // Step 1: Count soldiers in each row
    const soldiersCount = mat.map((row, index) => {
        const count = row.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
        return [count, index];
    });
    
    // Step 2: Sort rows by the number of soldiers, then by row index
    soldiersCount.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[1] - b[1]);
    
    // Step 3: Extract the first k indices from the sorted list
    const result = soldiersCount.slice(0, k).map(pair => pair[1]);
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Soldiers:** Counting soldiers in each row (n elements) for m rows is \(O(m \cdot n)\).
- **Sorting:** Sorting the rows based on soldier count is \(O(m \log m)\).
- **Slice and Map:** Slicing the first `k` elements and mapping to get indices is \(O(k)\).

**Overall Time Complexity: \(O(m \cdot n + m \log m)\)**

Use the above strategy and code to find the `k` weakest rows in the matrix efficiently.
