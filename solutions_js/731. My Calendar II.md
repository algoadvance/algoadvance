[Leetcode 731. My Calendar II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l731)
### Problem Statement

You are implementing a program to manage event bookings in a calendar. The program needs to support booking new events, where booking an event means adding a time interval (start, end). A new event can be added if it does not cause a triple booking, which means no three events should overlap at any time.

Implement a class `MyCalendarTwo`:

- `MyCalendarTwo()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `bool book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be successfully booked without causing a triple booking, and `false` otherwise. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `start` and `end`?**
   - Typically, `start` and `end` will be positive integers, and `start < end`.

2. **Is there a specific maximum duration for an event?**
   - No explicit limit is given; however, the values are bounded by typical integer constraints in JavaScript.

3. **Will the bookings always be non-overlapping initially?**
   - No, bookings can overlap as long as no time interval is part of three events at the same time.

### Strategy

1. **We need two lists of intervals:**
   - **Primary Bookings:** These intervals represent successfully booked events.
   - **Double Bookings:** These intervals represent the periods confirmed to be part of two overlapping events.

2. **For each new booking attempt:**
   - First, check whether the new event overlaps with any of the existing double bookings. If it does, return `false`.
   - Then, determine the overlapping intervals with the primary bookings and update the double bookings list accordingly.
   - Finally, add the current interval to the primary bookings.

3. **Helper function to determine intervals intersection:**
   - Calculate the intersection of two given intervals.

### Code

```javascript
class MyCalendarTwo {
    constructor() {
        this.bookings = [];
        this.doubleBookings = [];
    }
    
    book(start, end) {
        for (let interval of this.doubleBookings) {
            if (Math.max(start, interval[0]) < Math.min(end, interval[1])) {
                // This means [start,end) intersects with a double-booked interval
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check overlap with existing bookings and update double bookings
        for (let interval of this.bookings) {
            let intersectStart = Math.max(start, interval[0]);
            let intersectEnd = Math.min(end, interval[1]);
            
            if (intersectStart < intersectEnd) {
                // This means [start,end) intersects with an existing booking
                this.doubleBookings.push([intersectStart, intersectEnd]);
            }
        }
        
        // Add the current booking to the list of primary bookings
        this.bookings.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
}

// Example usage:
let calendar = new MyCalendarTwo();
console.log(calendar.book(10, 20)); // Returns true
console.log(calendar.book(50, 60)); // Returns true
console.log(calendar.book(10, 40)); // Returns true
console.log(calendar.book(5, 15));  // Returns false
console.log(calendar.book(5, 10));  // Returns true
console.log(calendar.book(25, 55)); // Returns true
```

### Time Complexity

- **`book` Method:**
  - **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(n^2) where `n` is the number of bookings.
    - Checking each double booking takes O(m) time, where m is the number of double bookings.
    - Checking and adding possible new double bookings involves another loop over the primary bookings.

While this approach is straightforward, it maintains efficiency for a typical interview's test case scales and ensures adhering to the no triple booking rule effectively.
