[Leetcode 2835. Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2835)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. In one operation, you can choose any integer from `nums` and remove it. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to form a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of the subsequence is at least `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the list of integers `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, assuming from context that `nums` contains only non-negative integers.

2. **What should be returned if it is impossible to form such a subsequence?**
   - Return -1.

3. **Should we consider cases where the list `nums` is empty?**
   - Yes, if `nums` is empty and the `target` is greater than 0, return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting Approach**:
   - First, sort the array in descending order. This ensures that we can try to form the sum using the largest numbers first, which minimizes the number of numbers we need.
   
2. **Iterate and Sum**:
   - Iterate through the sorted array and keep a running sum.
   - Count the number of elements added to form this running sum.
   - As soon as this running sum equals or exceeds the target, return the count of added elements.
   
3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If after iterating through the entire array, the running sum is still less than the target, return -1 because it's not possible to form such a subsequence.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(nums, target) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let currentSum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        currentSum += num;
        count++;
        if (currentSum >= target) {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    // If we cannot reach the target sum
    return -1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minOperations([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 11)); // Output: 3 ([5, 4, 2] or [5, 3, 3])
console.log(minOperations([2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3], 7)); // Output: 2 ([4, 3])
console.log(minOperations([1, 1, 1, 1], 5)); // Output: -1 (not possible to reach target sum)
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Iteration**: The iteration through the array takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case, if we need to iterate through all elements.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\), dominated by the sorting step.

This solution efficiently uses sorting and a greedy method to find the minimal subsequence meeting the required target sum.
