[Leetcode 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1975)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer matrix `matrix`. In one operation, you can choose any submatrix of `matrix` and flip all the signs of the elements in that submatrix. You need to return the maximum sum of the matrix elements that you can achieve with the given operation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the matrix guaranteed to be not empty?**
   - Yes, the matrix will have at least one element.
   
2. **Are there constraints on the size of the matrix?**
   - Typically, matrix dimensions are limited by the problem constraints on a coding platform like LeetCode, but for our solution, we will consider the general case.
   
3. **What are the possible range of values for matrix elements?**
   - Matrix elements can be any integer, including negative values, zero, and positive values.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Operation**:
   - Flipping the signs of a submatrix means changing positive values to negative and vice versa. This operation can turn negative values into positives which can help in maximizing the sum of the matrix.

2. **Optimal Approach**:
   - Since we can flip any submatrix, our goal is to leverage that flexibility to maximize the matrix's sum.
   - If we count the number of negative numbers:
     1. If the number of negatives is even, hypothetically, we can flip pairs of negatives to positives to achieve the maximum sum.
     2. If it's odd, we'll always have at least one negative element left no matter how we flip.
   - Thus, our aim should be to minimize the impact of the smallest magnitude element left negative.

3. **Steps**:
   - Calculate the sum of absolute values of all elements in the matrix.
   - Count the total number of negative numbers.
   - Determine the minimum absolute value in the matrix for the case when the count of negatives is odd.
   - If the number of negatives is odd, subtract twice the minimum absolute value from the summed absolute values to account for that one obligatory negative element.

## Code

```javascript
var maxMatrixSum = function(matrix) {
    let totalSum = 0;
    let minAbsValue = Infinity;
    let negativeCount = 0;

    for (let row of matrix) {
        for (let value of row) {
            totalSum += Math.abs(value);
            if (value < 0) {
                negativeCount++;
            }
            minAbsValue = Math.min(minAbsValue, Math.abs(value));
        }
    }

    // If the count of negative numbers is odd, we need to adjust the sum
    if (negativeCount % 2 !== 0) {
        totalSum -= 2 * minAbsValue;
    }

    return totalSum;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\)
  - We pass through each element of the matrix once to compute the total sum, count negatives, and find the minimum absolute value. Here `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the matrix.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We only use a few extra variables for calculations and do not require any additional data structures that scale with input size.

This solution ensures that we achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements after the optimal flipping of signs.
