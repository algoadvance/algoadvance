[Leetcode 552. Student Attendance Record II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l552)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of days a student has been attending classes. The attendance record for a student can be represented as a string composed of only three characters:
- 'A': Absent.
- 'L': Late.
- 'P': Present.

A student could be rewarded if the attendance record doesn't contain:
- More than one 'A' (absent).
- More than two continuous 'L' (late).

Given `n`, return the number of unique attendance records that can be rewarded. The result may be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of `n`?
   - The value of `n` can be up to a maximum of 100, as per typical contest constraints.
  
2. Should we consider sequences with exactly one ‘A’ and no continuous 'LL' as valid?
   - Yes, the sequence should not have more than one 'A' and should not have more than two continuous 'L'.

3. Are we always to assume a non-negative integer `n`?
   - Yes, `n` will always be a non-negative integer.

4. Is this problem meant to be solved in an optimized manner considering constraints?
   - Yes, we need to consider the efficiency of our algorithm.

## Code

```javascript
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

function checkRecord(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    if (n === 1) return 3;

    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(2).fill(0).map(() => new Array(3).fill(0)));
    
    dp[0][0][0] = 1;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let A = 0; A < 2; A++) {
            for (let L = 0; L < 3; L++) {
                // Ending with P
                dp[i][A][0] = (dp[i][A][0] + dp[i - 1][A][L]) % MOD;
                // Ending with A
                if (A > 0) dp[i][A][0] = (dp[i][A][0] + dp[i - 1][A - 1][L]) % MOD;
                // Ending with L
                if (L > 0) dp[i][A][L] = (dp[i][A][L] + dp[i - 1][A][L - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let A = 0; A < 2; A++) {
        for (let L = 0; L < 3; L++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][A][L]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkRecord(2));   // Output: 8
console.log(checkRecord(1));   // Output: 3
```

## Strategy

1. We use dynamic programming to keep track of all possible attendance records under the given conditions.
2. We maintain a 3D DP array where `dp[i][A][L]` represents the number of valid sequences of length `i` with `A` indicating the number of 'A's and `L` indicating the continuous 'L's up to that point.
3. We populate the DP array by considering three choices for each day - 'P', 'A', or 'L', and updating the counts according to these choices.
   - If we add 'P', it doesn't change the count of 'A' or add more 'L'.
   - If we add 'A', we need to ensure we have at most one 'A'.
   - If we add 'L', we need to check that the count of continuous 'L's doesn't exceed two.
4. The final answer is the sum of all valid sequences of length `n`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n) with respect to the number of days considering the dimensions of the DP array are small fixed values (i.e., 2 for 'A' and 3 for 'L'). This efficient dynamic programming approach ensures we can handle the maximum constraint of `n = 100`.
