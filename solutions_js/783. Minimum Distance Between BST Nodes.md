[Leetcode 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l783)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the tree's node structure?**
   Each node in the tree has an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.

2. **Can the BST have duplicate values?**
   By definition, a BST should not have duplicate values, so we can assume there are no duplicates.

3. **What if the BST contains fewer than two nodes?**
   Since the problem guarantees that the tree will have at least two nodes, we don't need to handle this case specially.

### Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal:**
   Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. An in-order traversal of a BST will yield the node values in sorted order.

2. **Compute Minimum Difference:**
   During the traversal, compute the difference between each successive pair of values and keep track of the minimum difference encountered.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

var minDiffInBST = function(root) {
    let prev = null;
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    
    const inOrderTraversal = (node) => {
        if (!node) return;
        
        // Traverse the left subtree
        inOrderTraversal(node.left);
        
        // Compute the difference with the previous value
        if (prev !== null) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, node.val - prev);
        }
        
        // Update the previous value
        prev = node.val;
        
        // Traverse the right subtree
        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    };
    
    inOrderTraversal(root);
    return minDiff;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the in-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the system stack during the recursive in-order traversal. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height can be O(N), but on average for a balanced tree, it would be O(log N).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum difference between any two nodes in the BST.
