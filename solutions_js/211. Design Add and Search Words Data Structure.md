[Leetcode 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l211)
### Problem Statement

Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Implement the `WordDictionary` class:

- `WordDictionary()` Initializes the object.
- `void addWord(word)` Adds `word` to the data structure, it can be matched later.
- `bool search(word)` Returns `true` if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or `false` otherwise. `word` may contain dots `.` where dots can be matched with any letter.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the length and content of the words?
   - Are the words case-sensitive?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should the implementation handle very large word datasets efficiently?
   - How should edge cases like adding an empty word or searching for a non-existent word be handled?

3. **Performance:**
   - How important is the search efficiency in this problem?
   - Are there any specific performance requirements?

### Code

```javascript
class TrieNode {
    constructor() {
        this.children = {};
        this.endOfWord = false;
    }
}

class WordDictionary {
    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }

    addWord(word) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (let char of word) {
            if (!(char in node.children)) {
                node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[char];
        }
        node.endOfWord = true;
    }

    search(word) {
        const dfs = (index, node) => {
            if (index === word.length) {
                return node.endOfWord;
            }
            const char = word[index];
            if (char === '.') {
                for (let child in node.children) {
                    if (dfs(index + 1, node.children[child])) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                return false;
            } else {
                if (!(char in node.children)) {
                    return false;
                }
                return dfs(index + 1, node.children[char]);
            }
        };
        return dfs(0, this.root);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const wordDictionary = new WordDictionary();
wordDictionary.addWord("bad");
wordDictionary.addWord("dad");
wordDictionary.addWord("mad");
console.log(wordDictionary.search("pad")); // false
console.log(wordDictionary.search("bad")); // true
console.log(wordDictionary.search(".ad")); // true
console.log(wordDictionary.search("b..")); // true
```

### Strategy

1. **Trie Data Structure:**
   - Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store the added words, which allows for efficient insert and search operations.
   
2. **Adding Words:**
   - Traverse each character of the word, create child TrieNodes if they don't exist.

3. **Searching Words with `.`:**
   - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to handle `.` wildcards. Explore all possible node children when encountering `.`.
   
4. **End of Word Marker:**
   - Mark the end of each word in the Trie to differentiate between prefixes and complete words.

### Time Complexity

1. **Add Word:**
   - Average case: O(m), where m is the length of the word being added.
   - Worst case: O(m), when all characters of the word lead to new nodes.

2. **Search Word:**
   - Best case: O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched, and all characters match exactly without wildcards.
   - Average/Worst case: O(m * 26^k), where k is the number of `.` wildcards in the word, due to the branching factor of up to 26 letters in each Trie step. Thus, if the depth of recursion involves wildcards, it can become exponential.

This implementation leverages the Trie data structure for prefix-based operations and extends it to handle search patterns with wildcards efficiently.
