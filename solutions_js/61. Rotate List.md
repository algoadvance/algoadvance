[Leetcode 61. Rotate List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l61)
### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the head of the rotated linked list.
   
2. **What if `k` is greater than the length of the list?**
   - Rotate `k % length` times, as rotating the list by its length results in the same list.

3. **What if the list is empty or `k` is 0?**
   - Return the list as is.

4. **How are we representing the linked list?**
   - Assume we have a linked list node class defined as follows:
     ```javascript
     function ListNode(val, next) {
         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
     }
     ```

### Strategy

1. **Length Calculation**: Calculate the length of the linked list.
2. **Modulus Operation**: Use `k % length` to handle cases where `k` is greater than the list length.
3. **Find Cut Point**: Identify the new tail of the rotated list (length - `k`th node from the beginning).
4. **Rearrange Pointers**: Adjust the `next` pointers to rotate the list.

### Code

```javascript
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
}

var rotateRight = function(head, k) {
    if (!head || k === 0) return head;
    
    // Calculate the length
    let length = 0;
    let current = head;
    while (current) {
        length++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // Find the effective rotations needed
    k = k % length;
    if (k === 0) return head;
    
    // Two-pointer technique to find the new head
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    while (fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    // slow is at the node before the new head
    let newHead = slow.next;
    slow.next = null;
    fast.next = head;
    
    return newHead;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm involves two main passes through the list.
  1. Calculating the length of the list: `O(n)`
  2. Rearranging pointers, which involves another pass: `O(n)`
  
  Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since no extra space other than pointers is used.

This approach ensures the list is rotated efficiently and handles edge cases such as when `k` is larger than the list length.
