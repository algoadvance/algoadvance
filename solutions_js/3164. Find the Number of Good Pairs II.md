[Leetcode 3164. Find the Number of Good Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3164)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and two positive integers `k` and `x`. A pair `(i, j)` is called a **good pair** if the following conditions are satisfied:
- `i < j`
- The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is smaller than or equal to `k`
- The difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is divisible by `x`

Return the number of good pairs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate numbers.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the array and the values of `k` and `x`?**
   - Assume standard constraints for competitive programming, which would likely be something like: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`, `1 <= k, x <= 10^6`.

3. **Should the function return the number of good pairs or the pairs themselves?**
   - The function should return just the number of good pairs.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Possible Pairs:** Iterate through each pair `(i, j)` in the array where `i < j`.
2. **Check Constraints for Good Pairs:** For each pair, check if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `k` and that the difference is divisible by `x`.
3. **Count Good Pairs:** Maintain a counter to count pairs that satisfy both conditions.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n^2):** The naive approach involves checking each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`, leading to a nested loop resulting in `O(n^2)` time complexity. Given the constraints, optimizations should be considered for handling large inputs efficiently.

### Solution

```javascript
function countGoodPairs(nums, k, x) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            let diff = Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]);
            if (diff <= k && diff % x === 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 3, 6, 2, 5];
let k = 3;
let x = 1;
console.log(countGoodPairs(nums, k, x)); // Output: depends on the input
```

### Optimization Idea

Given the constraint, an `O(n^2)` solution might be inefficient for large arrays. If the array size is large, we should consider alternate strategies such as:

1. **Sliding Window Technique:** Applicable if the array is sorted.
2. **Hash Map:** To store elements and their frequencies and use properties of modular arithmetic to reduce the number of comparisons.

### Optimized Approach (Hash Map)

```javascript
function countGoodPairs(nums, k, x) {
    let count = 0;
    let freqMap = new Map();

    for (let num of nums) {
        for (let key of freqMap.keys()) {
            let diff = Math.abs(num - key);
            if (diff <= k && diff % x === 0) {
                count += freqMap.get(key);
            }
        }
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 3, 6, 2, 5];
let k = 3;
let x = 1;
console.log(countGoodPairs(nums, k, x)); // Output: depends on the input
```

By using a hash map, you leverage the distribution of values, avoiding the full pairwise comparison, and thus potentially reducing the time complexity significantly for large input sizes.
