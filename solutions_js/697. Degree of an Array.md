[Leetcode 697. Degree of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l697)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers `nums`, the **degree** of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements. 

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of `nums`, that has the same degree as `nums`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because elements 1 and 2 appear twice each. 
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
1. [1, 2, 2, 3, 1] (length: 5)
2. [2, 2] (length: 2)
3. [2, 2, 3] (length: 3)
4. [1, 2, 2, 3] (length: 4)
The shortest length is 2. So output is 2.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 3 because element 2 is repeated three times.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
1. [2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2] (length: 6)
2. [2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2] (length: 6)
The shortest length is 6. So output is 6.
```

### Constraints:
- `nums.length` will be between 1 and 50,000.
- `nums[i]` will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any bounds on the elements in the array? Yes, each element in the array is a non-negative integer between 0 and 49,999.
2. What if multiple subarrays have the same smallest length? We just need to return the length of the smallest subarray.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Counting:** First, count the frequency of each element in the array to determine the degree.
2. **Tracking Indices:** Use a dictionary to store the first and last indices of each element.
3. **Finding Minimum Length:** For elements with frequencies equal to the degree, calculate the length of subarray between their first and last occurrences. Keep track of the minimum length.

### Code
```javascript
var findShortestSubArray = function(nums) {
    // Initialize the variables
    const counts = new Map();
    const firstIndex = new Map();
    const lastIndex = new Map();
    let degree = 0;

    // Iterate through the nums array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const num = nums[i];
        
        // Update counts map
        if (!counts.has(num)) {
            counts.set(num, 0);
            firstIndex.set(num, i);
        }
        counts.set(num, counts.get(num) + 1);
        lastIndex.set(num, i);

        // Update degree
        degree = Math.max(degree, counts.get(num));
    }

    // Find the minimum length of subarray with the same degree
    let minLength = nums.length;
    for (const [num, count] of counts) {
        if (count === degree) {
            const length = lastIndex.get(num) - firstIndex.get(num) + 1;
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, length);
        }
    }

    return minLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array several times but each iteration or operation is constant time, making the solution linear in nature.
