[Leetcode 2065. Maximum Path Quality of a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2065)
### Problem Statement

You are given an **undirected weighted graph** with `n` nodes and `e` edges. Nodes are indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each node has a quality value associated with it, given by the array `values`. The edges are represented by a 2D array `edges`, where each edge is represented as `[u, v, time]`, indicating an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with a traversal time `time`.

You start at node `0` and want to find a path such that you maximize the sum of the qualities of the unique nodes visited. However, you have a limited amount of time, given by the integer `maxTime`, which restricts the total traversal time on this path.

You can revisit nodes and edges multiple times, but the quality value of each node is counted only once.

Your task is to return the maximum path quality value within the limited traversal time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Characteristics**:
   - Can the graph contain cycles? Yes, it's an undirected graph, so cycles are possible.
   - Can the traversal time be zero? No, each edge has a positive traversal time.
   
2. **Values and Time Constraints**:
   - What are the ranges for `values`, `edges`, and `maxTime`?
     - `1 <= values.length <= 100`
     - `0 <= u, v < n` (edge nodes)
     - `1 <= time <= 100`
     - `0 <= maxTime <= 1000`

3. **Traversal Rules**:
   - You can revisit nodes and edges multiple times, but the quality value of a node is counted only once.
   - The traversal can return to the starting node `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list for the graph representation.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Perform a DFS starting from node `0` to explore different paths.
3. **Tracking**:
   - Use a set to keep track of unique nodes visited.
   - Keep a running total of the quality values.
   - Track the remaining time to ensure the total traversal time does not exceed `maxTime`.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - On each recursive call, move to an adjacent node, update the remaining time, and compute the quality sum.
   - Backtrack after exploring all possible paths from a given node.

### Code

Here's the code that implements this strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} values
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number} maxTime
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximalPathQuality = function(values, edges, maxTime) {
    const graph = buildGraph(edges);
    const numNodes = values.length;
    let maxQuality = 0;

    // Perform DFS with backtracking
    const dfs = (node, timeRemaining, visited, currentQuality) => {
        if (timeRemaining < 0) return;
        
        if (!visited.has(node)) {
            visited.add(node);
            currentQuality += values[node];
        }
        
        if (node === 0) {
            maxQuality = Math.max(maxQuality, currentQuality);
        }
        
        for (const [neighbor, time] of graph[node]) {
            dfs(neighbor, timeRemaining - time, new Set(visited), currentQuality);
        }
    };
    
    // Initialize DFS from start node 0
    dfs(0, maxTime, new Set(), 0);
    
    return maxQuality;
};

// Helper function to build the graph
const buildGraph = (edges) => {
    const graph = {};
    for (const [u, v, time] of edges) {
        if (!graph[u]) graph[u] = [];
        if (!graph[v]) graph[v] = [];
        graph[u].push([v, time]);
        graph[v].push([u, time]);
    }
    return graph;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity can be analyzed as follows:

- **DFS Exploration**: In the worst case, all nodes and edges might be explored multiple times in different paths. This leads to exponential complexity `O(2^N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Node & Edge Visits**: Each recursive call checks every adjacent node, leading to significant recursive depth.

Thus, considering both the exponential nature of possible paths and graph traversal, the final time complexity is `O(2^N * E)`, where `E` is the number of edges. However, this method ensures all paths considering the constraints are explored efficiently.
