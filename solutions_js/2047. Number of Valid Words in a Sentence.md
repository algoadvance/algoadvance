[Leetcode 2047. Number of Valid Words in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2047)
## Problem Statement

A sentence consists of lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), punctuation marks (`!`, `.`, `,`), and spaces (` `). Each word in the sentence should be separated by a single space.

You need to write a function that counts the number of valid words in a sentence. A valid word satisfies the following conditions:
1. It contains only lowercase letters, hyphens, and punctuation (`!`, `.`, `,`).
2. There should be at most one hyphen, which should be surrounded by lowercase characters (`a-b` is valid, but `-ab` and `ab-` are not).
3. There should be at most one punctuation mark (`!`, `.`, `,`), which should be at the end of the word.

Given a sentence string, return the number of valid words in it.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done with digits?**
   - Words containing any digits are not considered valid.

2. **Can a word have both a hyphen and a punctuation mark?**
   - Yes, but the hyphen should be surrounded by lowercase characters, and the punctuation mark should be at the end.

3. **How are punctuation marks treated within a word?**
   - Only one punctuation mark is allowed, and it must be at the end of the word.

4. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, the input can be an empty string, in which case the output should be 0.

## Strategy

- Split the input sentence by spaces to extract words.
- Initialize a counter to keep track of valid words.
- For each word:
  - Check if it contains any digits; if it does, skip it.
  - If it contains more than one punctuation mark or if the punctuation mark is not at the end, skip it.
  - If it contains more than one hyphen or the hyphen is not surrounded by lowercase letters, skip it.
  - If all checks are passed, increment the valid word counter.
- Return the counter.

## Code

```javascript
function countValidWords(sentence) {
  const words = sentence.split(' ');
  let validWordCount = 0;
  
  for (const word of words) {
    if (isValidWord(word)) {
      validWordCount++;
    }
  }
  
  return validWordCount;
}

function isValidWord(word) {
  let hyphenCount = 0;
  let punctuationCount = 0;
  const len = word.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    const char = word[i];
    
    if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
      return false;
    }
    
    if (char === '-') {
      hyphenCount++;
      if (hyphenCount > 1 || i === 0 || i === len - 1 || !isLowercase(word[i-1]) || !isLowercase(word[i+1])) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    
    if (char === '!' || char === '.' || char === ',') {
      punctuationCount++;
      if (punctuationCount > 1 || i !== len - 1) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}

function isLowercase(char) {
  return char >= 'a' && char <= 'z';
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countValidWords("a-bc")); // Output: 1
console.log(countValidWords("a-b. hello!")); // Output: 1
console.log(countValidWords("a!b")); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting the sentence into words:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the sentence.
- **Validating each word:** Each word is checked character by character, which is \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the word.
- **Overall complexity:** If there are \(k\) words and each word has an average length of \(m\), the overall complexity is \(O(k \times m)\).

In practical terms, this can be simplified to \(O(n)\) since the total number of characters processed is proportional to the length of the input sentence.
