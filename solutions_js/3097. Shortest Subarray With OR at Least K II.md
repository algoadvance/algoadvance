[Leetcode 3097. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3097)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer `K`, find the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of `arr` such that the bitwise OR of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the array `arr`**:
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - Are all integers within the array non-negative?

2. **What is the range of `K`?**
   - Is `K` guaranteed to be non-negative and does it fit within typical integer limits?
   
3. **Edge cases to consider**:
   - What should be returned if the array is empty?
   - What should be returned if no subarray meets the condition?

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll need variables to maintain the current OR value of the window, two pointers for the sliding window (start and end), and a variable to track the minimum length found.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window to explore subarrays.
   - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer to the right and update the OR value.
   - Once the OR value of the window is at least `K`, try to contract the window from the left to see if we can get a smaller subarray that still meets the condition.
   - Keep track of and update the minimum subarray length found during this process.

3. **Edge Cases**: Specifically consider edge cases like an empty array or subarrays that don't satisfy the condition.

## Time Complexity

- The approach leverages a sliding window, ensuring each element is processed at most twice, leading to a linear time complexity O(n).

## Code

```javascript
const shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK = (arr, K) => {
    const n = arr.length;
    if (n === 0) return -1;

    let minLength = Infinity;
    let start = 0;
    let currentOR = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        currentOR |= arr[end];

        while (currentOR >= K) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
            currentOR ^= arr[start];
            start++;
        }
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? -1 : minLength;
};

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const K = 7;
console.log(shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(arr, K)); // Output should be the length of the shortest subarray
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `minLength` is set to `Infinity` to easily find the minimum length during comparisons. `start` is the starting index of the sliding window, and `currentOR` holds the current OR value.
- **Sliding Window Expansion**: The for-loop iterates over the array, considering each element as a potential endpoint (`end`) of the window.
- **Window Contraction & Update**: Inside the while-loop, if the OR value of the current window meets or exceeds `K`, the length of the window is considered for the minimum length calculation, and the starting point (`start`) is moved rightwards to try and minimize the window size further.
- **Result**: If `minLength` remains `Infinity`, no subarray meets the condition and `-1` is returned. Otherwise, the smallest valid window length is returned.
