[Leetcode 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l123)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day. You are only allowed to complete at most two transactions. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. Note that you cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we perform more than two transactions?**
   - No, you can perform at most two transactions.
2. **What if the input array is empty or has only one element?**
   - If the input array is empty or has only one element, the maximum profit is 0 because no transactions can be completed.
3. **Is there a specific range for the stock prices?**
   - The stock price will be non-negative integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Track the profits of the first transaction:**
   - Iterate through the prices array and keep track of the minimum price seen so far and the maximum profit possible if we sell on each of these days.

2. **Track the profits of the second transaction:**
   - Iterate backward from the end of the prices array, keeping track of the maximum price seen so far and compute the maximum combined profit of the two transactions.

3. **Combine the results:** 
   - Use two arrays to keep the maximum profit up to a certain day with the first transaction, and the maximum profit from a certain day with the second transaction. The final result is the maximum value of adding these two arrays.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxProfit(prices) {
    if (prices.length < 2) return 0;

    const n = prices.length;
    const firstProfit = Array(n).fill(0);
    const secondProfit = Array(n).fill(0);

    let minPrice = prices[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, prices[i]);
        firstProfit[i] = Math.max(firstProfit[i - 1], prices[i] - minPrice);
    }

    let maxPrice = prices[n - 1];
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        maxPrice = Math.max(maxPrice, prices[i]);
        secondProfit[i] = Math.max(secondProfit[i + 1], maxPrice - prices[i]);
    }

    let maxProfit = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, firstProfit[i] + secondProfit[i]);
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We go through the prices array several times (fixed number of passes), so it's linear in complexity.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use two additional arrays (`firstProfit` and `secondProfit`) to store intermediate results which are linear in size relative to the input.
