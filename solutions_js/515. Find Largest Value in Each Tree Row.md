[Leetcode 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l515)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree. Return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: [1,3,9]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10^4].
- -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the expected output if the input tree is empty?
   - **A:** An empty array should be returned.
2. **Q:** Will the tree always be a valid binary tree as per the given constraints?
   - **A:** Yes, the tree will always be valid.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. Here are the steps:

1. **Initialization:** Start with a queue that initially contains the root node.
2. **Level Order Traversal:** For each level:
    - Initialize a variable to track the maximum value for that level.
    - Process all nodes on the current level and keep updating the maximum value.
    - Add child nodes of the current level to the queue for the next level.
3. **Result Storage:** Store the maximum value found for each level in a result array.
4. **Return Result:** After traversing all levels, return the result array.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var largestValues = function(root) {
    if (root === null) return [];

    let queue = [root];
    let result = [];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let maxVal = -Infinity;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift();
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, node.val);

            if (node.left !== null) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right !== null) queue.push(node.right);
        }

        result.push(maxVal);
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(M) where M is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the tree. In the worst case, this can be O(N) if the tree is completely unbalanced, but typically it is better than that.
