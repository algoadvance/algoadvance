[Leetcode 2682. Find the Losers of the Circular Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2682)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` and an integer `k`. There are `n` people standing in a circle initially numbered from `1` to `n`. You are supposed to find the positions of all the people who are "losers" in the game.

The game works as follows:
1. Starting from the 1st person, you count `k` people (including the person you start counting from).
2. The person you land on is eliminated from the game and is considered a loser.
3. Continue from the next person, and repeat the above steps until only one person is left.

Your task is to return the numbers of the loser's positions in an array in the order in which they are eliminated.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Is `k` always less than or equal to `n`?  
   **A**: Yes, you can assume `k` is always less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Q**: Should the positions returned start from 1 to `n`?  
   **A**: Yes, the positions should be within the range from 1 to `n`.

3. **Q**: Can `n` or `k` be zero?  
   **A**: No, `n` and `k` will always be positive integers.

### Strategy
We'll use a list to simulate the circle of people. We keep eliminating the person at the `k-th` position and continue the process until only one person remains. 

1. Initialize an array of people from `1` to `n`.
2. Initialize an empty result array to store the positions of eliminated people.
3. Use an index pointer to traverse and remove people:
   - Calculate the next removal index using modulo (`index = (index + k - 1) % len(current_list)`)
   - Remove the person at the calculated index and append to the result array
   - Continue this process until one person remains.

### Code
```javascript
function findLosers(n, k) {
    let people = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i + 1);
    let losers = [];
    let index = 0;

    while (people.length > 1) {
        index = (index + k - 1) % people.length;
        losers.push(people.splice(index, 1)[0]);
    }

    // We only return the losers array, the last person remaining isn't a loser
    return losers;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(findLosers(5, 3));  // Output: [3, 1, 5, 2]
console.log(findLosers(7, 2));  // Output: [2, 4, 6, 1, 5, 3]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- Removing an element from the middle of the list takes `O(n)` in the worst case.
- Since we remove `n-1` elements in total, the total time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

This solution is inefficient for large `n`, but it should work fine for reasonably small input sizes in typical interview settings. Depending on further constraints or optimizations, alternative data structures (such as a linked list) might be considered to reduce the time complexity.
