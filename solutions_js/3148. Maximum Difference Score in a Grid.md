[Leetcode 3148. Maximum Difference Score in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3148)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of integers. Your task is to find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid that maximizes the difference between the maximum and the minimum values encountered along the path. You can only move either right or down at any point in time.

Write a function that computes this maximum difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the size range of the grid?
    - Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the grid?
  
2. **Path Constraints**:
    - Can we assume that there is always at least one path from the top-left to the bottom-right?
  
3. **Output**:
    - Should the function return a single integer representing the maximum difference?
  
Let's assume the following constraints based on typical grid problems:
- The grid size is at most 100x100.
- The values in the grid range from -10^4 to 10^4.
- There is always at least one path from the top-left to the bottom-right.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of both the minimum and maximum values along any path from the top-left to the bottom-right. This can be done using dynamic programming.

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
    - Create two tables `minDP` and `maxDP` where `minDP[i][j]` holds the minimum value encountered along a path to position `(i, j)` and `maxDP[i][j]` holds the maximum value encountered along the same path.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `minDP[0][0]` and `maxDP[0][0]` with `grid[0][0]`.

3. **Iteration**:
    - Iterate through the grid, updating the `minDP` and `maxDP` tables based on the cells you can move to (right and down).

4. **Compute Differences**:
    - The difference for any cell `(i, j)` can be determined by `maxDP[i][j] - minDP[i][j]`.

5. **Result**:
    - The maximum value in the difference table at position `(n-1, m-1)` will be the desired result.

### Code

```javascript
function maxDifferenceInGrid(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const m = grid[0].length;
    
    const minDP = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m).fill(Infinity));
    const maxDP = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m).fill(-Infinity));
    
    minDP[0][0] = maxDP[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                minDP[i][j] = Math.min(minDP[i][j], minDP[i-1][j], grid[i][j]);
                maxDP[i][j] = Math.max(maxDP[i][j], maxDP[i-1][j], grid[i][j]);
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                minDP[i][j] = Math.min(minDP[i][j], minDP[i][j-1], grid[i][j]);
                maxDP[i][j] = Math.max(maxDP[i][j], maxDP[i][j-1], grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxDP[n-1][m-1] - minDP[n-1][m-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)` because we traverse each cell in the grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * m)` for storing the `minDP` and `maxDP` tables.

This approach ensures we efficiently compute the maximum difference along any path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid while adhering to the constraints.
