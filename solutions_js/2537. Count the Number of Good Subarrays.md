[Leetcode 2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2537)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

A subarray is considered good if there are at least `k` pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - `nums` can contain any integer values within typical integer bounds for the programming language.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Can `nums` be empty?**
   - Yes, if `nums` is empty, there are no subarrays at all, so the result should be `0`.

3. **Are the elements in `nums` always integers?**
   - Yes, the elements in `nums` are always integers.

### Strategy

To find the number of good subarrays, we can use a sliding window approach with a hash map to count occurrences of elements in the current window. This allows us to efficiently count the number of subarrays with at least `k` pairs.

Here's the general approach:

1. Use a sliding window where you expand the window by moving the right pointer.
2. Maintain a hash map to count occurrences of elements within the current window.
3. Track the number of pairs formed within the current window.
4. If the number of pairs within the window meets or exceeds `k`, increment the count of good subarrays by the number of subarrays that can be formed with the current left pointer.
5. Move the left pointer to shrink the window and continue the process.

### Code

```javascript
function countGood(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let countGoodSubarrays = 0;
    let pairCount = 0;
    const freq = new Map();
    let left = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        let num = nums[right];
        
        // Update frequency map and pair count
        if (freq.has(num)) {
            pairCount += freq.get(num);
            freq.set(num, freq.get(num) + 1);
        } else {
            freq.set(num, 1);
        }
        
        // Shrink the window from the left if pairCount is enough
        while (pairCount >= k) {
            countGoodSubarrays += (n - right); // all subarrays starting from current left to the end
            
            let leftNum = nums[left];
            freq.set(leftNum, freq.get(leftNum) - 1);
            if (freq.get(leftNum) > 0) {
                pairCount -= freq.get(leftNum);
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return countGoodSubarrays;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `countGoodSubarrays`: To count the number of good subarrays.
   - `pairCount`: To count the number of valid pairs within the current window.
   - `freq`: A hash map to store the frequency of elements within the current window.
   - `left`: The starting pointer for the sliding window.

2. **Expand the window**:
   - For each element at position `right`, update the frequency map and increment `pairCount` by the frequency of that element in the map, since each occurrence forms a pair with the new element.

3. **Shrink the window**:
   - If `pairCount` is greater than or equal to `k`, all subarrays starting from current `left` to `right` are good.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right, adjusting `pairCount` and the frequency map accordingly until `pairCount` is less than `k`.

### Time Complexity

- The overall complexity of this approach is `O(n)`:
  - Maintaining the frequency map and updating `pairCount` are both constant-time operations.
  - Each element is processed at most twice, once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it.
