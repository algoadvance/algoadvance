[Leetcode 1648. Sell Diminishing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1648)
### Problem Statement

You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls. The customer appreciates the value of the balls, which decreases as they're sold. The value of the balls is determined by their color, and balls of the same color have the same value which starts from a given value and decreases by 1 each time one ball of this color is sold.

You are given an integer array `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i-th` color initially in inventory. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You need to return the maximum total value that you can achieve by selling `orders` balls. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:

```
Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the highest value balls first (5,5,4,4) and sum their values to get 14.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `orders` always less than or equal to the total number of balls?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the orders will not exceed the total number of balls in inventory.

2. **What are the constraints for the problem?**
   - `1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9`
   - `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory), 10^9)`

### Strategy

1. **Sort the inventory in decreasing order**, so that we can start selling the most valuable balls first.
2. **Use a min-heap (or max-heap)** to efficiently get the next most valuable ball available.
3. **Greedily sell the most valuable balls first** until the orders are fulfilled.
4. To handle large numbers and ensure efficient calculations, use a formula for summing arithmetic sequences:
   - The sum of the first `k` elements of an arithmetic sequence is given by `k * (first_element + last_element) / 2`.
5. **Edge case handling:** Ensure that remaining orders are fulfilled even when dealing with balls with the same value.

### Code

```javascript
const maxProfit = (inventory, orders) => {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    inventory.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let maxProfit = 0;
    for (let i = 0; orders > 0 && i < inventory.length; i++) {
        let nextValue = i + 1 < inventory.length ? inventory[i + 1] : 0;
        let count = i + 1;

        let sellCount = Math.min(orders, count * (inventory[i] - nextValue));
        let fullBatches = Math.floor(sellCount / count);
        let remainder = sellCount % count;

        let sumFull = fullBatches * (2 * inventory[i] - (fullBatches - 1)) / 2;
        maxProfit = (maxProfit + sumFull * count) % MOD;

        let sumRemainder = remainder * (inventory[i] - fullBatches);
        maxProfit = (maxProfit + sumRemainder) % MOD;

        orders -= sellCount;
    }

    return maxProfit;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the `inventory` array takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of different colors.
- The main loop iterates through the inventory once, which takes \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently handles large inputs by reducing the number of operations needed to calculate the sum of sequences and ensures that the function performs well under constraint limits.
