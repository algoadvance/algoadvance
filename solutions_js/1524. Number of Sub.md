[Leetcode 1524. Number of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1524)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr`. Return the number of sub-arrays with an odd sum.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,3,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: All sub-arrays are [[1], [1,3], [1,3,5], [3], [3,5], [5]]
All sub-arrays sum are [1, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5].
Odd sums are [1, 9, 3, 5] so the result is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array have negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, as long as it's an integer array.
2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the array?
   - **A:** The array length can be up to 10^5.
3. **Q:** Should we consider an empty sub-array?
   - **A:** No, a valid sub-array must contain at least one element.

### Strategy
The key to solving this problem efficiently involves taking advantage of the properties of prefix sums and parity (odd/even). 

1. **Prefix Sum Property:**
   - We can use prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of any sub-array.
   - The sum of a sub-array `arr[i..j]` can be represented as `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]` where `prefix[k]` is the sum of array elements from the start up to index `k-1`.

2. **Odd/Even Sub-array Sum:**
   - To determine if a sub-array sum is odd, we need to track the prefix sums modulo 2 (i.e., whether they are odd or even).
   - If the `prefixSum % 2` is different at two positions `i` and `j`, then the sum of elements between those indices will be odd.

3. **Counting Prefix Modulo 2:**
   - Maintain a count of prefix sums that are odd and even.
   - Use these counts to determine how many sub-arrays between two prefix sums have an odd sum.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
var numOfSubarrays = function(arr) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    
    let oddCount = 0;
    let evenCount = 1; // Initialize to one to account for the "empty" prefix sum which is considered even
    let currentSum = 0;
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let num of arr) {
        currentSum += num;
        
        if (currentSum % 2 === 0) {
            // current prefix sum is even
            result = (result + oddCount) % MOD;
            evenCount++;
        } else {
            // current prefix sum is odd
            result = (result + evenCount) % MOD;
            oddCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution only requires a single pass through the array. Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)** where n is the length of the array.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a constant amount of extra space to keep track of counts and sums.
