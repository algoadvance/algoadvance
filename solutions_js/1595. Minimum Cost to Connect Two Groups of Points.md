[Leetcode 1595. Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1595)
### Problem Statement
We are given two groups of points, `group1` and `group2` with sizes `m` and `n` respectively, and an `m x n` matrix `cost` where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of connecting the i-th point in `group1` to the j-th point in `group2`. We want to connect each point in `group1` to exactly one point in `group2` and vice versa. Our task is to find the minimum cost to connect two groups of points.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Must each point in `group1` and `group2` be connected one-to-one?**
   - Yes, each point in `group1` must connect to exactly one point in `group2` and each point in `group2` must connect to exactly one point in `group1`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of `group1` and `group2`?**
   - Typically, constraints are given in the problem, but it's safe to assume `m` and `n` can be up to 12 (as per the problem's hidden constraints).

3. **Can we have multiple connections to satisfy constraints?**
   - Yes, sometimes multiple connections might be required to ensure no point is left unconnected.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP) combined with bitmasking. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define States:**
   - We'll use a DP array where `dp[mask1][mask2]` denotes the minimum cost to connect points represented by `mask1` from `group1` and `mask2` from `group2`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` because there is no cost for connecting no points.

3. **Transitions:**
   - For each pair of masks `mask1` and `mask2`, iterate over all possible connections and update the DP array.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer will be `dp[(1 << m) - 1][(1 << n) - 1]`, indicating that all points in `group1` and `group2` are connected.

### Code
Here's the Javascript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
var connectTwoGroups = function(cost) {
    const m = cost.length;
    const n = cost[0].length;
    
    const dp = Array.from({ length: 1 << m }, () => Array(1 << n).fill(Infinity));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    
    for (let mask1 = 0; mask1 < (1 << m); ++mask1) {
        for (let mask2 = 0; mask2 < (1 << n); ++mask2) {
            if (dp[mask1][mask2] === Infinity) continue;
            
            for (let i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                if ((mask1 & (1 << i)) !== 0) continue;
                for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if ((mask2 & (1 << j)) !== 0) continue;

                    let newMask1 = mask1 | (1 << i);
                    let newMask2 = mask2 | (1 << j);
                    dp[newMask1][newMask2] = Math.min(dp[newMask1][newMask2], dp[mask1][mask2] + cost[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    let result = Infinity;
    for (let mask1 = 0; mask1 < (1 << m); ++mask1) {
        for (let mask2 = 0; mask2 < (1 << n); ++mask2) {
            if (popcount(mask1) === m || popcount(mask2) === n) {
                result = Math.min(result, dp[mask1][mask2]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

function popcount(x) {
    return x.toString(2).split('0').join('').length;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this DP solution with bitmasks is `O(2^m * 2^n * (m + n))`:
- We use two states, each having `2^m` and `2^n` possible values.
- Updating each state involves iterating through the points in both groups, resulting in `O(m + n)` operations per state.

This is efficient enough given the problem usually has constraints around `m, n <= 12`.

### Summary
We've tackled the problem of connecting two groups of points with the minimum cost using a dynamic programming approach combined with bitmasking to handle connections efficiently. The code computes the required costs and ensures all points are optimally connected.
