[Leetcode 2287. Rearrange Characters to Make Target String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2287)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings - `s` and `target`. You are tasked with returning the maximum number of copies of `target` that can be formed by rearranging the characters of `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are the inputs always non-empty strings?
   - Should we consider case sensitivity in the strings?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be a single integer representing the maximum number of copies that can be created?

**Assumptions**:
- Yes, the inputs are always non-empty strings.
- Yes, case sensitivity matters, i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.
- The output should be a single integer.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - First, we need to count the frequency of each character in both `s` and `target`.

2. **Compute Maximum Copies**:
   - For each character in `target`, determine how many times it can be found in `s` considering the frequency.

3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**:
   - The minimum number of times any required character can fit in the `target` string will determine the maximum possible copies of `target` string that can be formed using characters from `s`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The result will be the smallest quotient of available characters in `s` divided by the required characters in `target`.

## Code

```javascript
function rearrangeCharacters(s, target) {
    const sCount = {};
    const targetCount = {};

    // Count frequency of each character in s
    for (const char of s) {
        if (sCount[char] === undefined) {
            sCount[char] = 1;
        } else {
            sCount[char]++;
        }
    }

    // Count frequency of each character in target
    for (const char of target) {
        if (targetCount[char] === undefined) {
            targetCount[char] = 1;
        } else {
            targetCount[char]++;
        }
    }

    // Determine the maximum number of copies of target that can be formed
    let minCopies = Infinity;
    for (const char in targetCount) {
        if (!sCount[char]) {
            return 0;  // If any required character is missing in s
        }
        const copies = Math.floor(sCount[char] / targetCount[char]);
        if (copies < minCopies) {
            minCopies = copies;
        }
    }

    return minCopies;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "ilovecodingonleetcode";
const target = "code";
console.log(rearrangeCharacters(s, target));  // Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building Frequency Count**:
   - For `s`: O(n), where `n` is the length of string `s`.
   - For `target`: O(m), where `m` is the length of string `target`.

2. **Determining Maximum Copies**:
   - Number of unique characters in `target` can be considered constant in upper bound because alphabet size is fixed (26 for lowercase, 52 if considering both cases).

Overall Time Complexity: **O(n + m)**

The space complexity is also O(n + m) due to the storage required for the frequency counts of both strings.
