[Leetcode 834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l834)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between node `i` and all other nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Types of values in the tree:**
   - Are the node labels guaranteed to be consecutive integers starting from 0 to n-1?
  
   Yes, the problem statement suggests standard tree nodes indexed from 0 to n-1.

2. **Unique Edges:**
   - Are edges guaranteed to be unique, and is it guaranteed that the input forms a valid tree?   
   
   Yes, it is guaranteed that the input forms a valid tree, meaning there are `n-1` edges with no cycles.

3. **Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on `n`?  

   The number of nodes can range from 1 to 30,000.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, we need an efficient solution to compute the sum of distances for each node in linear time. Here is an outline of the approach we'll use:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

2. **Post-order DFS (first pass):**
   - Calculate the sum of distances (`dist_sum`) and the count of nodes (`node_count`) in the subtree rooted at each node.

3. **Pre-order DFS (second pass):**
   - Using the results from the post-order DFS, compute the answer for each node using a parent-to-child relationship where:
     \[
     \text{answer}[child] = \text{answer}[parent] - \text{node\_count}[child] + (n - \text{node\_count}[child])
     \]

This two-pass approach enables us to solve the problem in O(n) time.

### Code

```javascript
function sumOfDistancesInTree(n, edges) {
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }

    const dist_sum = Array(n).fill(0);
    const node_count = Array(n).fill(1); // Initialize with 1 for each node itself.

    function postOrderDFS(node, parent) {
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            postOrderDFS(neighbor, node);
            node_count[node] += node_count[neighbor];
            dist_sum[node] += dist_sum[neighbor] + node_count[neighbor];
        }
    }

    function preOrderDFS(node, parent) {
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            dist_sum[neighbor] = dist_sum[node] - node_count[neighbor] + (n - node_count[neighbor]);
            preOrderDFS(neighbor, node);
        }
    }

    postOrderDFS(0, -1);
    preOrderDFS(0, -1);

    return dist_sum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sumOfDistancesInTree(6, [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]));
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes.

- The creation of the adjacency list takes O(n).
- The post-order DFS traversal takes O(n), as it visits each node and edge once.
- The pre-order DFS traversal also takes O(n), for the same reason.

Thus, the entire solution operates in linear time relative to the number of nodes in the tree.
