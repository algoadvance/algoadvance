[Leetcode 2344. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2344)
## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums` and `numsDivide` of positive integers, you are allowed to delete any number of elements from `nums`. The goal is to make the smallest element in `nums` that remains after deletions divide all elements in `numsDivide`.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed, or -1 if this is not possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no such element exists in `nums`?**
   - The function should return `-1`.

2. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - It is stated that the arrays contain positive integers, so they should not be empty based on the problem constraints.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of the arrays?**
   - The problem does not specify array size limits, but typically such problems handle sizes within the constraints of competitive programming limits.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor) of all elements in `numsDivide`, as this value must be divisible by any remaining elements of `nums` to satisfy the condition.

2. **Sort `nums`**. This will help in finding the minimum element that can divide the GCD more efficiently, and also calculate the number of deletions easily.

3. **Iterate through `nums`**, and for each element, check if it can divide the GCD:
    - If yes, return the index of this element, as this would be the number of deletions needed.
    - If no valid element is found, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
function minDeletions(nums, numsDivide) {
    // Helper function to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            [a, b] = [b, a % b];
        }
        return a;
    }
    
    // Calculate the GCD of all elements in numsDivide
    let gcdValue = numsDivide[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < numsDivide.length; i++) {
        gcdValue = gcd(gcdValue, numsDivide[i]);
        if (gcdValue === 1) break; // Early termination, as 1 divides every element
    }
    
    // Sort nums to find the minimum element that can divide the gcdValue
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Iterate through the sorted nums array to find the element that divides gcdValue
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (gcdValue % nums[i] === 0) {
            return i; // Number of deletions is equal to the index
        }
    }
    
    // If no element in nums can divide the gcdValue, return -1
    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting `nums`**: This takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.
2. **Calculating GCD for all elements in `numsDivide`**: This involves \(O(m \log k)\), where \(m\) is the length of `numsDivide` and \(k\) is the value of the largest number being operated on for GCD calculation.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log k)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of deletions necessary to create an array where the smallest element divides all elements in `numsDivide`.
