[Leetcode 1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1283)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`. Find the smallest positive integer divisor such that the result of summing each number in the `nums` array divided by this divisor is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded up to the nearest integer (i.e., `Math.ceil(nums[i] / divisor)`).

Return the smallest divisor that achieves the condition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` and `threshold`:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array and the range of values it can contain?
   
2. **Guaranteed Solution:**
   - Is it guaranteed that a solution always exists for the given input?

3. **Exact Division by 1:**
   - Can we assume that dividing by 1 should always be a valid approach?

### Code

```javascript
function smallestDivisor(nums, threshold) {
    // Helper function to compute the sum of ceil(nums[i] / divisor) for the entire array
    const computeSum = (divisor) => {
        let sum = 0;
        for (const num of nums) {
            sum += Math.ceil(num / divisor);
        }
        return sum;
    };

    let left = 1;
    let right = Math.max(...nums); // Starting range for binary search

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (computeSum(mid) > threshold) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency:**
   - Given the constraint that we need to find the smallest divisor, a binary search is a suitable strategy to minimize the number of checks.
   - The search range for the divisor will be between `1` and the maximum value in the `nums` array.

2. **Sum Computation Using Helper Function:**
   - Create a helper function `computeSum(divisor)` which calculates the sum of `Math.ceil(nums[i] / divisor)` for all elements in `nums`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Initialize `left` to `1` (the smallest possible divisor) and `right` to the maximum element in `nums`.
   - Perform a binary search:
     - Calculate the middle point of the current range.
     - Use the helper function to calculate the sum for the middle divisor.
     - If the sum exceeds the `threshold`, move the search to the higher half (i.e., set `left = mid + 1`).
     - Otherwise, move the search to the lower half (i.e., set `right = mid`).

4. **Termination and Result:**
   - The search terminates when `left` equals `right`. At this point, `left` will be the smallest divisor that achieves the desired condition.
   
### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in `O(log(max(nums)))` where `max(nums)` is the maximum value in the array.
- **Sum Calculation:** Each sum computation takes `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(max(nums)))`, efficient enough for a large range of inputs within typical constraints.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest divisor while maintaining a balance between the complexity and performance.
