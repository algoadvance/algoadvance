[Leetcode 29. Divide Two Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l29)
### Problem Statement:
Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide the `dividend` by the `divisor` without using multiplication, division, and mod operator. Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.

*Note:*
1. Both the dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
2. The divisor will never be 0.
3. Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2³¹, 2³¹ − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 2³¹ − 1 when the division result overflows.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Should negative dividends and divisors be handled?
    - Yes, the division should account for sign and return the correct truncated value for both positive and negative inputs.

### Strategy:
1. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If `dividend` is `0`, return `0`.
   - If `divisor` is `1`, return `dividend`.
   - If `divisor` is `-1`, return `-dividend`, but ensure it does not overflow.
2. **Determine the Sign of the Result:**
   - If either `dividend` or `divisor` is negative (but not both), the result should be negative.
3. **Use Bitwise Operations:**
   - Use bit shifting and subtraction to find the quotient. 
   - Starting with the highest possible bit, attempt to fit the divisor into the remaining part of the dividend by shifting the divisor left.
   - Accumulate the quotient based on where the divisor could fit.
4. **Ensure the Result is within Bounds:**
   - Clamp the result to be within the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Code:

```javascript
function divide(dividend, divisor) {
    // Handle edge cases
    if (dividend === 0) return 0;
    if (divisor === 1) return dividend;
    if (divisor === -1) {
        if (dividend === -2147483648) return 2147483647; // Handle overflow
        return -dividend;
    }

    // Determine sign of the result
    let isNegative = (dividend < 0) !== (divisor < 0);

    // Work with positive values for simplicity
    let absDividend = Math.abs(dividend);
    let absDivisor = Math.abs(divisor);

    let quotient = 0;
    while (absDividend >= absDivisor) {
        let tempDivisor = absDivisor;
        let multiple = 1;
        while (absDividend >= (tempDivisor << 1)) {
            tempDivisor <<= 1;
            multiple <<= 1;
        }
        absDividend -= tempDivisor;
        quotient += multiple;
    }

    if (isNegative) {
        quotient = -quotient;
    }

    // Clamp result to 32-bit signed integer range
    return Math.min(Math.max(-2147483648, quotient), 2147483647);
}

// Example usage
console.log(divide(10, 3));   // Outputs: 3
console.log(divide(7, -3));   // Outputs: -2
console.log(divide(-10, -2)); // Outputs: 5
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)), where n is the absolute value of the `dividend`. This is because the division is performed by bit shifting, which reduces the problem size by half each time.
