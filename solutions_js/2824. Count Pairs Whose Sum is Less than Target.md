[Leetcode 2824. Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2824)
## Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer `target`. Your task is to find the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the numbers in `nums` always integers? 
    - Yes.
2. Can the numbers in `nums` be negative?
    - Yes.
3. Are there any constraints on the length of the array `n` or the values in the array?
    - The typical constraints will guide us towards an efficient solution. For example, if `n` is very large (up to \(10^5\)), sorting-based or O(n^2) solutions might be inefficient.

## Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**:
    - Iterate through all possible pairs `(i, j)` and count the pairs where `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.
    - This has a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Optimized Approach**:
    - Sort the array `nums`.
    - Use two-pointer technique to find the pairs:
        - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the next position to the `left` (`right`).
        - If the sum `nums[left] + nums[right]` is less than `target`, 
            - All pairs from `nums[left] + nums[right], nums[left] + nums[right+1], ..., nums[left] + nums[n-1]` will also be valid pairs.
        - Adjust the pointers accordingly and count the valid pairs.
    - This will have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for the two-pointer traversal.

## Code

```javascript
function countPairs(nums, target) {
    // Sort the array to use the two-pointer technique
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0;
    
    // Use two pointers to scan through the array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        let left = i + 1;
        while (left < nums.length && nums[i] + nums[left] < target) {
            count++;
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countPairs([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6));  // Output: 4
console.log(countPairs([-1, 0, 2, 3], 2));    // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Two-pointer traversal**: O(n)
- The overall time complexity is O(n log n).

This approach efficiently counts the pairs by leveraging the sorted order to quickly rule out multiple pairs at once.
