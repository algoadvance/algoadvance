[Leetcode 1217. Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1217)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` chips, where the position of the `i-th` chip is `position[i]`. You can perform the following types of moves any number of times (possibly zero) on any chip:
- Move the i-th chip by 2 units: cost = 0
- Move the i-th chip by 1 unit: cost = 1

Return the **minimum cost** needed to move all the chips to the same position.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the position array?**
   - The number of chips `n` can be up to `100`.
   - The positions are positive integers.

2. **Is the position array always populated with valid integers?**
   - Yes, assume valid input as per the problem description.

3. **Can there be any chips already in the same position?**
   - Yes, that is possible.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Moves:**
   - Moving a chip by 2 units does not incur any cost, regardless of its even or odd position.
   - Moving a chip by 1 unit costs 1 coin.

2. **Odd vs. Even Positions:**
   - Chips in even positions can move to any other even position at zero cost.
   - Chips in odd positions can move to any other odd position at zero cost.
   - Moving a chip from an even position to an odd position (or vice versa) will cost 1 coin.

3. **Counting Odd and Even Positions:**
   - Count the number of chips in even positions.
   - Count the number of chips in odd positions.

4. **Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The minimum cost will be moving all chips either to an odd position or an even position.
   - Thus, the cost will be the minimum of the number of chips at even positions or odd positions.

### Code

Let's implement the strategy in JavaScript.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} position
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCostToMoveChips = function(position) {
    let evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
    
    for (let pos of position) {
        if (pos % 2 === 0) {
            evenCount++;
        } else {
            oddCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return Math.min(evenCount, oddCount);
};
```

### Explanation

- **Variable Initialization:**
  - `evenCount` and `oddCount` are initialized to zero to count chips in even and odd positions respectively.

- **Counting:**
  - Loop through each position in the array.
  - If the position is even (`pos % 2 === 0`), increment `evenCount`.
  - Otherwise, increment `oddCount`.

- **Result Calculation:**
  - Return the minimum of `evenCount` and `oddCount`, as this represents the minimum cost to move all chips to a position that minimizes the cost.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `position` array. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of input size.
