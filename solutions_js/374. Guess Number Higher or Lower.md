[Leetcode 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l374)
### Problem Statement
You are playing a guessing game with your friend. Your friend picks a number from 1 to n. You have to guess the number, and each guess should return whether the number is higher, lower, or equal to the number your friend has picked.

Your task is to write the function `guessNumber(n)` which uses a pre-defined `guess(num)` API function to determine the correct number. The `guess(num)` API returns three possible values:

- -1: Your guess is higher than the number your friend picked.
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number your friend picked.
- 0: Your guess is correct.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of n?**
   - The value of n is positive and would typically range from 1 to some large value, for example, up to 2^31 - 1.
2. **Is the function `guess(num)` already provided?**
   - Yes, assume the `guess(num)` function is pre-defined and available for use.
3. **What type of input does `guessNumber(n)` accept?**
   - It accepts an integer `n` which represents the range [1, n] within which the number is picked.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use a binary search algorithm. Binary search will help us reduce the number of guesses by half each time, leading to logarithmic time complexity.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers: `left` to 1 and `right` to n.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, perform the following:
   - Calculate the mid-point: `mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.
   - Call the `guess(mid)` function.
     - If it returns 0, `mid` is the correct guess; return `mid`.
     - If it returns -1, it means the correct number is lower, so adjust the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
     - If it returns 1, it means the correct number is higher, so adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param {number} num   your guess
 * @return               -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *                       1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *                       0 if num is equal to the picked number
 * var guess = function(num) {}
 */

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var guessNumber = function(n) {
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const result = guess(mid);

        if (result === 0) {
            return mid;
        } else if (result === -1) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else { // result === 1
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // If not found, though we should always find the number.
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the upper limit of the range [1, n]. This is because in each step, the algorithm reduces the search space by half.
