[Leetcode 3095. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3095)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of `nums` such that the bitwise OR of the elements of the subarray is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the values in `nums`?
2. Can the elements in `nums` be negative, or are they non-negative integers?
3. Is the array `nums` guaranteed to have at least one element?

Assumptions:
1. `nums` contains non-negative integers.
2. `k` is a positive integer.
3. The length of `nums` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
4. Each element in `nums` is in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Approach**: Utilize a sliding window to keep track of the current subarray and its bitwise OR.
   - Start with two pointers, `start` and `end`, initialized to the beginning of the array.
   - Expand the `end` pointer to include more elements in the subarray.
   - If the current bitwise OR of the subarray (from `start` to `end`) is at least `k`, try to shrink the subarray by moving the `start` pointer to find the smallest length that satisfies the condition.
   - Keep track of the minimum length of such subarrays.
2. **Bitwise Operations**: 
   - Use the bitwise OR operation to combine elements in the subarray.
   - Reset the running OR value when moving the `start` pointer.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and once by the `start` pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, aside from input and output, only a few variables are used.

### Code

```javascript
function shortestSubarrayWithOR(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let start = 0;
    let currentOr = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity;

    for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        currentOr |= nums[end];

        while (start <= end && currentOr >= k) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
            currentOr ^= nums[start]; // Reset current OR with the element leaving the window
            start++;
        }
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? -1 : minLength;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const k = 6;
console.log(shortestSubarrayWithOR(nums, k));  // Output: 2
```

### Explanation
- Initialize the sliding window with `start` and `end` pointers.
- As the `end` pointer expands, include elements in the current OR calculation.
- When the OR of the current window is at least `k`, attempt to shrink the window from the left by incrementing the `start` pointer.
- The minimum length of such windows is tracked in `minLength`.
- If no subarray is found with OR at least `k`, return `-1`; otherwise, return the `minLength`.
