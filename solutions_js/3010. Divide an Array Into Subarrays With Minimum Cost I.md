[Leetcode 3010. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3010)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, divide the array into a minimum number of subarrays such that the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in each subarray is at most `k`. Return the minimum number of subarrays required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `nums`?
   - What is the range of values for `k`?
   - What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?

2. **Output Specifics:**
   - If the array is already valid (i.e., does not need to be divided), should the function return `1`?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle an empty array?
   - How should the function handle an array with only one element?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to focus on partitioning the array into the smallest number of subarrays where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in each subarray does not exceed `k`.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a count of subarrays `count = 1` to account for the first subarray.
   - Track the minimum and maximum values encountered so far in the current subarray using `current_min` and `current_max`.

2. **Iteration through the array:**
   - Iterate through each element in the array.
   - Update `current_min` and `current_max`.
   - If the difference between the `current_max` and `current_min` exceeds `k`, increment the subarray count and reset `current_min` and `current_max` to the current element.

3. **Final Computation:**
   - The result is the final count of subarrays.

### Code

```javascript
function minSubarrays(nums, k) {
    if (!nums || nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let count = 1; // at least one subarray is needed
    let current_min = nums[0];
    let current_max = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        current_min = Math.min(current_min, nums[i]);
        current_max = Math.max(current_max, nums[i]);
        
        // Check if the current subarray is invalid
        if (current_max - current_min > k) {
            count++;
            // Start a new subarray from the current element
            current_min = nums[i];
            current_max = nums[i];
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(minSubarrays([1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11], 2)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array a single time and performing constant-time operations within the loop.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
