[Leetcode 2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2493)
### Problem Statement

You are given a connected undirected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`. Each node has a `color`, and some nodes share the same color. 

Your task is to divide the nodes into the maximum number of groups such that all nodes in each group meet the following conditions:
1. All nodes in the same group have the same color.
2. No two nodes in the same group are connected directly.

Write a function `maxGroups(n, edges, colors)` where:
- `n` is the number of nodes.
- `edges` is a list of pairs `[u, v]` representing that node `u` and node `v` are connected by an edge.
- `colors` is a list such that `colors[i]` is the color of the `(i+1)`-th node.

Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a node belong to more than one group?
    - No, each node can only belong to one group.
2. Is there a guarantee that the graph is connected?
    - Yes, the graph is guaranteed to be connected.
3. Are all colors represented in the graph?
    - We assume that all colors mentioned are used in the graph.
4. What is the range of `n` (number of nodes)?
    - Let's assume `1 <= n <= 1000`.

### Strategy

1. **Group by Color**: First, we will group the nodes based on their color.
2. **Check Independency**: For each color group, we will need to ensure that no two nodes in the same group are directly connected. This can be done by running a check for direct edges within nodes of the same color.
3. **Bipartite Check**: If nodes of same color form a bipartite graph, then we can split them into 2 groups.

### Plan

1. Create a dictionary to store all nodes by their color.
2. For each color group,:
   - Create a subgraph with nodes of the same color.
   - Check if the subgraph is bipartite (using BFS).
   - If bipartite, the group count is 2; if not, it's 1.
3. Sum up the group counts for all color groups.

### Code

```javascript
function maxGroups(n, edges, colors) {
    // Step 1: Create adjacency list for the graph
    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => []);
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push(v);
        adjList[v].push(u);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Group nodes by color
    const colorGroups = {};
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        const color = colors[i - 1];
        if (!colorGroups[color]) {
            colorGroups[color] = [];
        }
        colorGroups[color].push(i);
    }
    
    function isBipartite(nodes) {
        const color = {};
        for (const node of nodes) {
            color[node] = -1;
        }
        
        const queue = [];
        
        for (const node of nodes) {
            if (color[node] === -1) {
                queue.push(node);
                color[node] = 0;
                
                while (queue.length > 0) {
                    const current = queue.shift();
                    
                    for (const neighbor of adjList[current]) {
                        if (!colorGroups[colors[neighbor - 1]].includes(neighbor)) continue; // Neighbor must be in the same color group
                        if (color[neighbor] === -1) {
                            color[neighbor] = 1 - color[current];
                            queue.push(neighbor);
                        } else if (color[neighbor] === color[current]) {
                            return false;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Calculate the maximum number of groups
    let maxGroupCount = 0;
    for (const color in colorGroups) {
        const nodes = colorGroups[color];
        if (isBipartite(nodes)) {
            maxGroupCount += 2;
        } else {
            maxGroupCount += 1;
        }
    }

    return maxGroupCount;
}

// Example Usage:
// n = 5, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]], colors = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
// Should return 5 as no two nodes of the same color are directly connected.
console.log(maxGroups(5, [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]], [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]));
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Grouping by Color**: O(n)
2. **Bipartite Check**: O(n + e) for each color group where `n` is the number of nodes and `e` is the number of edges in the group.
3. **Overall**: The complexity is O(n + e) due to the need to traverse the entire graph and group nodes accordingly.

This approach should efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints.
