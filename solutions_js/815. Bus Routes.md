[Leetcode 815. Bus Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l815)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `routes` representing the bus routes such that `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `ith` bus repeats forever. For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the `0th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> ...`.

You will start at the bus stop `source` (initially not on any bus). You want to reach the bus stop `target` by taking the minimum number of buses. Return the least number of buses you must take to reach the destination `target`. If it is not possible to reach the target bus stop, return `-1`.

Example 1:
```
Input: routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to go from 1 to 7, then take the second bus to go from 7 to 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: routes = [[7, 12], [4, 5, 15], [6], [15, 19], [9, 12, 13]], source = 15, target = 12
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of ``routes`` or the values within it?
2. Is there a possibility that `source` or `target` not being present in any route?
3. Can `routes` have duplicate bus stops within a single bus route array?

## Strategy

1. **Modeling as a Graph Problem**: Treat each bus stop as a node in the graph, and edges exist between nodes that are in the same bus route.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the shortest path from `source` to `target`:
    - Each bus route can be considered a possible path.
    - Add bus routes to the BFS queue and track visited routes to avoid cycles.
    
**Steps:**
1. Create a mapping from each bus stop to the list of bus routes it belongs to.
2. Initialize a queue for BFS with the starting bus stop and track visited bus stops and bus routes.
3. Process each stop in the queue, exploring connected bus routes and stops.
4. If the target bus stop is reached, return the number of buses taken.
5. If the queue is exhausted without finding the target, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} routes
 * @param {number} source
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var numBusesToDestination = function(routes, source, target) {
    if (source === target) return 0;
    
    const stopToRoutes = new Map();
    
    // Create a mapping from stop to routes
    for (let i = 0; i < routes.length; i++) {
        for (const stop of routes[i]) {
            if (!stopToRoutes.has(stop)) {
                stopToRoutes.set(stop, []);
            }
            stopToRoutes.get(stop).push(i);
        }
    }
    
    const visitedStops = new Set();
    const visitedRoutes = new Set();
    const queue = [[source, 0]]; // [currentStop, busesTaken]
    
    while (queue.length) {
        const [currentStop, busesTaken] = queue.shift();
        
        // Explore all buses that pass through the current stop
        for (const routeIndex of stopToRoutes.get(currentStop) || []) {
            if (visitedRoutes.has(routeIndex)) continue;
            
            // Mark this route as visited
            visitedRoutes.add(routeIndex);
            
            // Explore all stops in this route
            for (const stop of routes[routeIndex]) {
                if (stop === target) return busesTaken + 1;
                if (!visitedStops.has(stop)) {
                    visitedStops.add(stop);
                    queue.push([stop, busesTaken + 1]); 
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // If we exhaust the queue and have not found the target stop
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is approximately `O(N * M)` where `N` is the number of bus routes and `M` is the number of stops in the longest route. Here's the breakdown:
- Creating the stop to routes mapping takes `O(N * M)`.
- BFS traversal in the worst case will visit each stop and route once, which is also `O(N * M)`.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(N * M)`.
