[Leetcode 2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2209)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `floor` representing the floor, which has white tiles (represented as '1') and black tiles (represented as '0'). You are also given the integer `numCarpets` and the integer `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` carpets where each carpet can cover `carpetLen` tiles in the floor.

Your task is to return the minimum number of white tiles still visible on the floor after covering it with the carpets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the carpets allowed to overlap?**
   - If the carpets overlap, it might influence the strategy for minimizing the white tiles.

2. **Is the floor string guaranteed to have a length of at least 1?**
   - This would help to avoid trivial cases of an empty string.

3. **Can `carpetLen` be greater than the length of the floor?**
   - If yes, this would mean a single carpet could potentially cover the entire floor.

4. **What are the constraints on the size of `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`?**
   - This information is crucial to choose between different potential algorithms.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum number of visible tiles at each position on the floor, considering the use of the carpets.
   
2. **State Representation:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum number of white tiles visible if we have considered up to the `i`th tile and used `j` carpets.
   
3. **Transition:**
   - For each tile, we have two choices:
     - Do not place a new carpet, then the number of white tiles at this position is dependent on the previous state.
     - Place a new carpet starting at this position, which will cover up to `carpetLen` tiles from here.

4. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][0]` would be 0 because with zero carpets and zero tiles, there are no white tiles visible.
   - Generally, `dp[i][0]` will accumulate the white tiles from the floor without any carpets to begin with.

### Code

```javascript
var minimumWhiteTiles = function(floor, numCarpets, carpetLen) {
    const n = floor.length;
    
    // Create and initialize dp array
    const dp = Array.from({length: n + 1}, () => Array(numCarpets + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Initialize the visible tiles when no carpet is used
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + (floor[i - 1] === '1' ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= numCarpets; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + (floor[i - 1] === '1' ? 1 : 0);
            if (i >= carpetLen) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i - carpetLen][j - 1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 0);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][numCarpets];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * numCarpets)
  - We iterate over each tile for up to `numCarpets` carpets.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * numCarpets)
  - We maintain a DP table with size proportionate to `n` and `numCarpets`.

This approach provides an efficient way to keep track of the minimum white tiles after placing the carpets and ensures optimal use of overlapping when advantageous.
