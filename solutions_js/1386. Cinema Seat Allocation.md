[Leetcode 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1386)
### Problem Statement

**1386. Cinema Seat Allocation**

A cinema has `n` rows of seats, numbered from 1 to `n` and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10. Given the array `reservedSeats` containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, `reservedSeats[i] = [3,8]` means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is reserved. Return the maximum number of 4-person groups you can assign on the remaining seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as between the 4th and 5th seats or between the 6th and 7th seats) are not considered to be adjacent seats.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q1:** Can a four-person group occupy seats regardless if they span across rows or not?
  - **A:** No, a four-person group must occupy seats within the same row.
- **Q2:** Should we consider groups that span across the aisle between the 4th and 5th seats and the 6th and 7th seats?
  - **A:** No, groups cannot span across these aisles.
- **Q3:** How should we handle multiple reserved seats in a single row?
  - **A:** You should account for all reserved seats and ensure the remaining blocks can accommodate groups without spanning reserved seats or aisles.

### Strategy

1. **Parsing Reserved Seats**: Create a dictionary to store reserved seats for each row.
2. **Checking Groups**: For each row, check possible positions for placing 4-person groups which include checking from seat 2 to 5, 4 to 7, and 6 to 9 in a row (to avoid spanning across aisles).
3. **Maximize Group Placements**: For each row, try to place the maximum number of groups without overlapping reserved seats.
4. **Count**: Sum the possible groups for all rows and return the result.

### Code

```javascript
function maxNumberOfFamilies(n, reservedSeats) {
    // Step 1: Parse reserved seats into a map of rows
    let reservedMap = new Map();
    for (let [row, seat] of reservedSeats) {
        if (!reservedMap.has(row)) {
            reservedMap.set(row, []);
        }
        reservedMap.get(row).push(seat);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Helper to count groups in a row
    const countGroupsInRow = (rowSeats) => {
        let reserved = new Set(rowSeats);
        let count = 0;
        if (!reserved.has(2) && !reserved.has(3) && !reserved.has(4) && !reserved.has(5)) {
            count++;
        }
        if (!reserved.has(4) && !reserved.has(5) && !reserved.has(6) && !reserved.has(7)) {
            count++;
        } else if (!reserved.has(6) && !reserved.has(7) && !reserved.has(8) && !reserved.has(9)) {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Calculate the number of groups
    let totalGroups = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (reservedMap.has(i)) {
            totalGroups += countGroupsInRow(reservedMap.get(i));
        } else {
            totalGroups += 2; // maximum 2 groups can fit in an untouched row
        }
    }
    
    return totalGroups;
}

// Example test case
console.log(maxNumberOfFamilies(3, [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]])); // Expected output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- Parsing reserved seats takes O(m) time, where m is the number of reserved seats.
- Counting groups in each row (checking up to 3 valid subarrays of positions) is constant work, O(1) for each row, so it overall takes O(n).

Therefore, the total time complexity is O(m + n), where m is the number of reserved seats, and n is the number of rows in the cinema.
