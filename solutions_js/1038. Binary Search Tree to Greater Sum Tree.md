[Leetcode 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1038)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Sum Tree (GST) where every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST. Here is the problem link for your reference: [Leetcode 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of a BST?**
   - A BST is a binary tree where for each node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater.

2. **Do we have to return the modified tree or just modify it in place?**
   - The problem specifies modifying the tree in place and returning the root of the modified tree.

3. **Are the node values guaranteed to be unique?**
   - While BST does not necessarily require unique values, typical problems assume unique node values to simplify the problem.

## Strategy
To solve the problem of converting a BST to a GST, we need to perform a reverse in-order traversal (right -> node -> left). This way, we can accumulate the sum of all greater nodes as we visit each node. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: We keep a running sum that stores the total of all nodes processed so far.
2. **Reverse In-Order Traversal**: Traverse the tree starting from the rightmost node, because in a BST, the rightmost node has the greatest value.
3. **Node Modification**: For each node, update its value by adding the current running sum to its original value.
4. **Update Sum**: Update the running sum to include the node's new value.

## Code
```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

var bstToGst = function(root) {
    let sum = 0;

    function reverseInOrderTraversal(node) {
        if (node === null) return;

        // Traverse the right subtree first
        reverseInOrderTraversal(node.right);

        // Update the sum and node's value
        sum += node.val;
        node.val = sum;

        // Traverse the left subtree
        reverseInOrderTraversal(node.left);
    }
    
    reverseInOrderTraversal(root);
    return root;
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during our reverse in-order traversal.

The space complexity can be considered **O(h)**, where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height could be n, making space complexity O(n). For a balanced tree, the height would be log(n).

This solution efficiently modifies the BST in place to a GST while maintaining clarity and simplicity.
