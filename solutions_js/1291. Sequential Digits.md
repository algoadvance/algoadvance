[Leetcode 1291. Sequential Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1291)
### Problem Statement

1291. Sequential Digits

An integer has sequential digits if and only if each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

Return a sorted list of all the integers in the range [low, high] inclusive that have sequential digits.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: low = 100, high = 300
Output: [123,234]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
Output: [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are `low` and `high` inclusive?
   - **A:** Yes, the range [low, high] is inclusive.
  
2. **Q:** What are the constraints on `low` and `high`?
   - **A:** Typically, `low` and `high` are constrained by typical 32-bit integer range, but verifying exact constraints from the problem statement would be helpful.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to generate all the sequential digit numbers that fall within the given range. 

Here's a structured approach:

1. **Identify Sequential Digits:** 
   Generate sequential digits by utilizing the property that each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit. This can be done iteratively.

2. **Range Filtering and Sorting:**
   Store these sequential digits and filter out those that lie within the specified range. Since they are generated sequentially, they will inherently be sorted.

### Code

```javascript
function sequentialDigits(low, high) {
    const result = [];
    const sequential = "123456789";
    
    // Generate all sequential numbers based on string slicing
    for (let length = 2; length <= sequential.length; length++) {
        for (let start = 0; start + length <= sequential.length; start++) {
            const num = parseInt(sequential.substring(start, start + length));
            if (num >= low && num <= high) {
                result.push(num);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(sequentialDigits(100, 300));  // Output: [123, 234]
console.log(sequentialDigits(1000, 13000));  // Output: [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789, 12345]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of generating all possible sequential digit numbers and then filtering them is determined mainly by the nested loop which generates sequential numbers and the filtering condition. The nested loop runs in a controlled range which depends on the length of the input number string ("123456789"). Hence:

- **Generation complexity:** O((n*(n+1))/2), where n is the number of digits in the max value (essentially it's O(45) for maximum 9 digits)
- **Filtering complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of sequential numbers generated which is sifted through.

Since these values are small and fixed, the overall complexity is linear concerning the number of sequential digit combinations, making it relatively efficient.
