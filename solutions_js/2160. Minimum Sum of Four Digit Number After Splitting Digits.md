[Leetcode 2160. Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2160)
### Problem Statement

You are given a four-digit number `num`. Split the digits of `num` into two new numbers, `new1` and `new2`, such that the sum of `new1` and `new2` is minimized. The digits should not be re-ordered; they should remain in their original sequence.

Return the minimum possible sum of `new1` and `new2`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: num = 2932
Output: 52
Explanation: Split num into [29, 32], the sum is 29 + 32 = 61, which is the minimal possible sum.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the digits rearranged while forming the numbers?**
   - No, the digits should stay in order.

2. **Can `new1` and `new2` have different numbers of digits?**
   - Yes, they can have different lengths.

### Strategy

Given that `num` is a four-digit number, we need to split it into two numbers in such a way that their sum is minimized. Since the digits should remain in their original order, we can directly evaluate all possible ways to split the number:

1. Split after the first digit: `new1` = num[0], `new2` = num[1:] 
   - `new1` = num[0], `new2` = parseInt(num[1:] in their integer form.)

2. Split after the second digit: `new1` = num[0:2], `new2` = num[2:4] 
   - `new1` = parseInt(num[0:2]), `new2` = parseInt(num[2:4]).

3. Split after the third digit: `new1` = num[0:3], `new2` = num[3] 
   - `new1` = parseInt(num[0:3]), `new2` = num[3].

Compute the respective sums for these splits and return the minimum of these sums.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumSum(num) {
    let str = num.toString();

    // Split configurations
    let splits = [
        [parseInt(str[0]), parseInt(str.substring(1))],
        [parseInt(str.substring(0, 2)), parseInt(str.substring(2))],
        [parseInt(str.substring(0, 3)), parseInt(str[3])]
    ];

    // Compute sums and find the minimum sum
    let minSum = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < splits.length; i++) {
        let new1 = splits[i][0];
        let new2 = splits[i][1];
        minSum = Math.min(minSum, new1 + new2);
    }
    
    return minSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minimumSum(2932)); // Output: 52
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- The number of operations (string splits and integer parsing) is constant, given that the input is always a four-digit number.

By carefully examining all possible splits, the provided solution ensures the minimal possible sum of the two new numbers.
