[Leetcode 2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2396)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. A strictly palindromic number is a number that is palindromic in all bases from 2 to `n-2` (inclusive). A number `x` is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Your task is to determine if the given number `n` is strictly palindromic.

**Constraints:**
- 4 <= `n` <= 10^9

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if `n` is not strictly palindromic?**
   - Return `false`.

2. **Is there an example to simplify understanding?**
   - If `n` is 4, we need to check if `n` is a palindrome in bases 2 and 3. 

### Strategy

**1. Convert Number to Base:**
    - Create a function to convert a number `n` to its representation in a given base `b`.

**2. Check Palindrome:**
    - Create a function to check if a string (number in a specific base) is a palindrome.

**3. Integrate and Check all Bases:**
    - For each base from 2 to `n-2`, convert `n` to that base and check if it's a palindrome. If any of these checks fail, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Base:** Converting an integer `n` to a base `b` takes O(log n) time.
- **Palindrome Check:** Checking if a string is palindrome takes O(k) time where k is the length of the string.
- **Overall:** Since we might need to convert the number for all bases from 2 to `n-2`, this could be very inefficient, clearly exceeding polynomial time for large `n`.

However, a critical observation is that it is inherently impossible for any `n >= 4` to be strictly palindromic, because in base `n-2`, `n` will always be represented as `12`, which is not a palindrome. Therefore, we can directly return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isStrictlyPalindromic = function(n) {
    // For all n >= 4, it's impossible for n to be strictly palindromic
    // because in base (n-2), n is represented as "12", which is not a palindrome.
    return false;
};

// Test cases
console.log(isStrictlyPalindromic(4));  // Output: false
console.log(isStrictlyPalindromic(5));  // Output: false
console.log(isStrictlyPalindromic(10));// Output: false
```

### Explanation

Given the nature of the problem, it has been proven mathematically that no integer n can be strictly palindromic for any n >= 4. Thus, the function directly returns `false` without performing any base conversions or palindrome checks. This makes the solution optimal with O(1) time complexity.
