[Leetcode 420. Strong Password Checker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l420)
## Problem Statement

A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:

1. It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
2. It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
3. It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met).

Write a function `strongPasswordChecker(s: string) -> int` that, given a string `s`, returns the minimum change required to make `s` a strong password. If `s` is already strong, return `0`.

Here, a change is defined as inserting, deleting, or replacing a character.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the valid characters for the password? (Assuming standard ASCII characters.)
    - Can the input contain special characters or spaces?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the output be strictly the count of changes or optionally more details?

To keep it straightforward, assume the input can include standard ASCII characters and we only need to return the count of changes.

## Strategy

1. **Check Length**:
    - Length less than 6: Need to insert characters.
    - Length more than 20: Need to delete characters.

2. **Character Requirements**:
    - Ensure at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.
    
3. **Repeating Characters**:
    - For segments of three or more repeating characters, calculate replacements required.

4. **Adjust for Length Violations**:
    - If length violations exist, factor in the effect of insertions or deletions on the number of replacements required for repeating characters.

## Code

```javascript
function strongPasswordChecker(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false;
    
    // Check character types
    for (let char of s) {
        if (/[a-z]/.test(char)) hasLower = true;
        if (/[A-Z]/.test(char)) hasUpper = true;
        if (/[0-9]/.test(char)) hasDigit = true;
    }
    let missingTypes = 3 - (hasLower + hasUpper + hasDigit);
    
    // Check repeating sequences and count replacements
    let replace = 0, oneSeq = 0, twoSeq = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ) {
        let j = i;
        while (i < n && s[i] === s[j]) i++;
        let len = i - j;
        if (len >= 3) {
            replace += Math.floor(len / 3);
            if (len % 3 === 0) oneSeq += 1;
            else if (len % 3 === 1) twoSeq += 1;
        }
    }
    
    if (n < 6) {
        return Math.max(missingTypes, 6 - n);
    } else if (n <= 20) {
        return Math.max(missingTypes, replace);
    } else {
        // Needs deletions
        let deleteCount = n - 20;
        
        // Prioritize reducing replacements by reducing sequences modulo 3
        if (deleteCount <= oneSeq) {
            replace -= deleteCount;
        } else if (deleteCount - oneSeq <= 2 * twoSeq) {
            replace -= oneSeq + Math.floor((deleteCount - oneSeq) / 2);
        } else {
            replace -= oneSeq + twoSeq + Math.floor((deleteCount - oneSeq - 2 * twoSeq) / 3);
        }
        return deleteCount + Math.max(missingTypes, replace);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Character Check:** O(n) to check for the presence of lowercase, uppercase, and digits.
- **Repeating Sequence Check:** O(n) to identify sequences and calculate replacements.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

The operations are linear in nature and handle the string in a single pass with additional passes for specific checks, making it efficient for moderately long passwords.
