[Leetcode 335. Self Crossing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l335)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `distance`.

You start at the origin `(0, 0)` of an x-y plane and move according to these steps:

1. Always move the distance in the ith step according to `distance[i]`.
2. You can only move north, west, south, and east. Find out if your path crosses itself â€“ i.e., you move into a location you have been to before.

Return `true` if your path crosses itself, and `false` if it does not.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the distance array?**
   - The given distances are non-negative integers.

2. **Is the direction cyclic (north, west, south, east)?**
   - Yes, you move in a cycle: north (up), west (left), south (down), east (right).

3. **What is the minimum and maximum length of the distance array?**
   - Let's assume there's no explicit constraint provided in the prompt. 

4. **How to handle edge cases like `distance` containing less than 4 elements?**
   - If the length of `distance` is less than 4, the path cannot cross itself.

### Strategy

To determine if the path crosses itself, we simulate the movement step-by-step and use geometric conditions to check if at any point the path returns to touch or cross its previous path. Here's a simple high-level breakdown:

1. **Initial Move**: Start from (0, 0) and move north, west, south, and east cyclically.
2. **Tracking the Path**: Use an array or list to keep track of the vertices of the path.
3. **Check for Crossing**: For each new move after the initial moves, check if the current segment intersects with any of the previous segments.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} distance
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSelfCrossing = function(distance) {
    let len = distance.length;
    if (len < 4) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 3; i < len; i++) {
        // Case 1: Fourth line crosses first line and onward
        if (distance[i] >= distance[i - 2] && distance[i - 1] <= distance[i - 3]) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Case 2: Fifth line meets first and onward
        if (i >= 4 && distance[i - 1] == distance[i - 3] && distance[i] + distance[i - 4] >= distance[i - 2]) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Case 3: Sixth line crosses first and onward
        if (i >= 5 && distance[i - 2] >= distance[i - 4] &&
            distance[i] + distance[i - 4] >= distance[i - 2] &&
            distance[i - 1] <= distance[i - 3] &&
            distance[i - 1] + distance[i - 5] >= distance[i - 3]) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `distance` array. This is because we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently checks for path crossings with linear complexity and constant space usage.
