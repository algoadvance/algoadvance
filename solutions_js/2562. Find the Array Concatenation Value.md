[Leetcode 2562. Find the Array Concatenation Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2562)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the *array concatenation value*. The array concatenation value is defined as the sum of all values obtained by concatenating the elements of `nums` in pairs. Specifically, for every distinct pair of indices `i` and `j` where `i < j`, concatenate `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` to form a number and then sum all these numbers. Return the sum thus obtained.

Example: 
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 134
Explanation: 
- Concatenate 1 and 2 to get 12; 
- Concatenate 1 and 3 to get 13; 
- Concatenate 2 and 3 to get 23;
Sum = 12 + 13 + 23 = 48.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `nums`:** What is the acceptable range for the length and values of the elements in `nums`?
   - **Answer:** The length of `nums` can vary widely, and the values are non-negative integers.

2. **Output Type:** What should be the type of the result?
   - **Answer:** The result should be an integer representing the sum of all concatenated pairs.

3. **Constraints:** Are there any specific constraints on runtime or space complexity we should be aware of?
   - **Answer:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize a variable to store the sum.
2. Loop through the array, and for each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j`, concatenate `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
3. Convert this concatenated string back to a number and add it to the sum.
4. Return the final sum.

### Code
```javascript
function findArrayConcatenationValue(nums) {
    let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            let concatenatedNumber = parseInt('' + nums[i] + nums[j]);
            sum += concatenatedNumber;
        }
    }

    return sum;
}

// Example usage
console.log(findArrayConcatenationValue([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 134
```

### Time Complexity
- **Loop Complexity:** The algorithm uses a nested loop with `O(n^2)` complexity, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. Each pair takes constant time for concatenation and conversion to a number.
- **Overall Complexity:** The overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops iterating over all pairs of elements.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the sum variable. There is no additional space proportional to the input size being used.
