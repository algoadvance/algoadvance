[Leetcode 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1553)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. You need to determine the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges. You can eat oranges using the following steps:

1. If `n` is divisible by 3, you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges. 
2. If `n` is divisible by 2, you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
3. You can always eat 1 orange.

Write a function `minDays(n)` that returns the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer within the range `[0, 2 * 10^9]`.
2. **What should be returned if `n` is 0?**
   - If `n` is 0, the function should return 0 because no days are needed to eat 0 oranges.

### Strategy
To find the minimum number of days to eat `n` oranges, a recursive approach can be considered. Given the constraints, a direct recursive solution will not be efficient due to recomputation of the same values. Thus, we will use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid duplicate work.

The recursive function will:
1. Check if `n` is 0; if so, return 0.
2. Check if `n` is already memoized; if so, return the stored value.
3. Otherwise:
   - If `n` is divisible by 3, compute the result by eating `2*(n/3)` oranges.
   - If `n` is divisible by 2, compute the result by eating `n/2` oranges.
   - In parallel, always compute the result by eating one orange.
4. Take the minimum of the possible results and memoize it.

### Code

```javascript
var minDays = function(n) {
    const memo = new Map();
    
    const helper = (n) => {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        if (memo.has(n)) return memo.get(n);
        
        // Option 1: Eat 1 orange
        let days = 1 + helper(n - 1);
        
        // Option 2: Eat 2*(n/3) oranges if n is divisible by 3
        if (n % 3 === 0) {
            days = Math.min(days, 1 + helper(n / 3));
        } else {
            days = Math.min(days, 2 + helper(Math.floor(n / 3)));
        }
        
        // Option 3: Eat n/2 oranges if n is divisible by 2
        if (n % 2 === 0) {
            days = Math.min(days, 1 + helper(n / 2));
        } else {
            days = Math.min(days, 2 + helper(Math.floor(n / 2)));
        }
        
        memo.set(n, days);
        return days;
    };
    
    return helper(n);
};

// Example Usage:
console.log(minDays(10)); //Expected Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
The code uses memoization to store results of computations for values from 0 to `n`. Each value is computed once before being reused, leading to a time complexity of O(n).
