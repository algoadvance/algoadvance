[Leetcode 2119. A Number After a Double Reversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2119)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num`. You need to return whether the integer can be the same after performing a double reversal.
To perform a double reversal, you reverse the digits of the number and then reverse the resulting number's digits again.

Example:
- Input: `num = 526`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: A double reversal returns the number as-is: `"526" -> "625" -> "526"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the number contain leading zeros?
    - Yes, but only after reversing, for example, `num = 100` might lead to intermediate `001` which turns fully if reversed again.

2. What is the range of the positive integers we are dealing with?
    - Given the general constraints in typical coding problems, we can assume the value of `num` fits within 32-bit integers.

3. Are we considering any special cases?
    - The problem is quite straightforward, we mainly have to consider basic reversals and their properties.

### Strategy

1. The nature of integer reversal means that the zeroes at the end of a number are lost after the first reversal.
2. Any integer without trailing zeroes will be the same after a double reversal. This is because reversing the number twice will yield the same integer.
3. For integers with trailing zeroes:
    - Example: `100` reversed to `001` (which is `1` after ignoring leading zeros)
    - Reversing `1` back returns `1` (which is different from the original `100`)
4. Thus, for the double reversal to yield the same number, the integer must not have any trailing zeros.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSameAfterReversals = function(num) {
    // Check if the number has any trailing zeroes
    // without converting the number to a string
    return num === 0 || num % 10 !== 0;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because checking whether a number ends with zero and comparing it are constant-time operations.

### Summary

- The solution checks if the number is zero or if it does not have trailing zeroes.
- This approach ensures that the double reversal property is satisfied only for numbers that can retain their original form without losing trailing information through reversals.
