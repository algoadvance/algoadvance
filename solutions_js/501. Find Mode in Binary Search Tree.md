[Leetcode 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l501)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST), return the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurring element) in it. If the BST has more than one mode, return them in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output if the BST is empty?**
   - Return an empty array.
   
2. **Can the BST contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, and finding the mode(s) involves identifying the most frequently occurring value(s).

3. **What form should the output take?**
   - Output should be an array of the mode(s).

4. **Is there any constraint on the value and structure of the input?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
   - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal**:
   - Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. Since it's a BST, an in-order traversal will give us values in a sorted order.

2. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each value.

3. **Find Mode**:
   - Determine the maximum frequency and collect all values with that frequency.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty tree (although the problem constraint guarantees at least one node).

## Code

```javascript
function findMode(root) {
    let current = root;
    let prev = null;
    let count = 0;
    let maxCount = 0;
    let modes = [];
    
    const inorder = node => {
        if (!node) return;
        
        inorder(node.left);
        
        if (prev !== null && prev.val === node.val) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 1;
        }
        
        if (count > maxCount) {
            maxCount = count;
            modes = [node.val];
        } else if (count === maxCount) {
            modes.push(node.val);
        }
        
        prev = node;
        
        inorder(node.right);
    }
    
    inorder(current);
    
    return modes;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse each node of the tree exactly once, leading to a linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h)
  - The space complexity is determined by the height of the tree, which results from the recursion stack in an in-order traversal. In the worst case of a skewed tree, it could be O(n). However, for a balanced tree, it will be O(log n). The additional space for storing the modes is O(n) in the worst case where all values are modes.

By using the in-order traversal, we effectively leverage the BST properties, allowing us to keep the solution efficient and straightforward.
