[Leetcode 1512. Number of Good Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1512)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i]` == `nums[j]` and `i` < `j`.

Return the number of good pairs.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array is a good pair.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the size range for the input array `nums`?
2. Can the input array contain negative integers or zeros?
3. Should we handle arrays with a single element specially, considering they can’t form pairs?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a more efficient approach than the brute force method. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Utilize a Hash Map**: We'll use a hash map (or an object in JavaScript) to keep track of the frequency of each number in the array.
2. **Counting Good Pairs**: As we iterate through the array, for each number, we check how many times it has already appeared (based on our hash map). Each occurrence contributes to the good pairs formed with previous occurrences of that number.

### Code
Here’s how we can implement the strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var numIdenticalPairs = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let freqMap = {};
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (freqMap[num]) {
            count += freqMap[num];
            freqMap[num] += 1;
        } else {
            freqMap[num] = 1;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numIdenticalPairs([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3])); // Outputs: 4
console.log(numIdenticalPairs([1, 1, 1, 1])); // Outputs: 6
console.log(numIdenticalPairs([1, 2, 3])); // Outputs: 0
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once, and hash map operations (insertion and lookup) are average O(1). This is efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
