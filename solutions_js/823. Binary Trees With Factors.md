[Leetcode 823. Binary Trees With Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l823)
Sure, let's break down the task and go through each section clearly.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of unique integers, `arr`, where each integer `arr[i]` is greater than 1, we need to determine the number of binary trees we can make, where each non-leaf node’s value is the product of its two children’s values. 

Each integer from `arr` can be used multiple times in different binary trees. 

Return the number of binary trees that can be formed, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input size and constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of `arr`?
    - Can `arr` be sorted or should we assume it is not?
    - Are there any particular constraints or special cases to handle?
  
2. **Properties of the numbers**:
    - Should we consider any special properties of the numbers (e.g., prime factors)?
  
3. **Efficiency**:
    - Do we have any specific efficiency requirements beyond what's inferred from typical large inputs (e.g., constraints on time/space complexity)?

### Given clarified typical assumptions

1. `arr` will have a length of up to `1000`.
2. The integer values in `arr` can be large but are capped at a certain practical value.
3. Sorting `arr` is permissible to streamline factor checking.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the array so we can build trees in a bottom-up manner.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming to store the number of ways to create trees with each element as the root.
   - Traverse each element in the sorted array, and for each pair `(a, b)` such that `a * b = current_element`, update the DP state accordingly.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the results can be very large, we need to take results modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
const numFactoredBinaryTrees = (arr) => {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const dp = new Map();

    for (let x of arr) {
        dp.set(x, 1); // each number can at least form one tree by itself
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (arr[i] % arr[j] === 0) { // arr[j] is a factor
                const right = arr[i] / arr[j];
                if (dp.has(right)) {
                    const currentCount = dp.get(arr[i]);
                    const additionalCount = dp.get(arr[j]) * dp.get(right);
                    dp.set(arr[i], (currentCount + additionalCount) % MOD);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let value of dp.values()) {
        result = (result + value) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numFactoredBinaryTrees([2, 4])); // Output: 3
console.log(numFactoredBinaryTrees([2, 4, 5, 10])); // Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Dynamic Programming Setup**: \(O(n^2)\), considering the nested loop checking all pairs for factor relationships.

The overall complexity would be dominated by the \(O(n^2)\) part due to the nested loops for factor checking.

### Space Complexity
- **Space for DP**: O(n) due to the storage of counts for each number in a map.

In the code, we ensure modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and keep the count manageable within the computational constraints provided.
