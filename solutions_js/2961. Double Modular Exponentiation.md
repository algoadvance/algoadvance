[Leetcode 2961. Double Modular Exponentiation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2961)
## Problem Statement

The given LeetCode problem likely involves computing a double modular exponentiation of form \( (a^b)^c \mod m \). This would generally be computed in steps to handle large integers efficiently, employing modular properties. We'll attempt to solve the problem even if specifics are not entirely clear from the ID.

Let's denote the problem more formally:

Given four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(m\), compute:

\[ result = (a^b)^c \mod m \]

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Numbers**: What is the range of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(m\)?
   - This helps determine if special handling of large numbers is needed.

2. **Constraints and Edge Cases**: What are the typical constraints?
   - For instance, how to handle \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), or \(m\) if they are zero or one.

3. **Output Format**: Should the output be a single integer?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can break it down using properties of modular exponentiation, particularly leveraging Pythonâ€™s `pow` function which supports three arguments \( pow(base, exp, mod) \). The steps are:

1. Compute \( a^b \mod m \).
2. Raise the result to the power \(c\) and again take modulo \(m\).

### Steps
1. Calculate \( temp = a^b \mod m \).
2. Calculate \( result = temp^c \mod m \).

Using efficient modular exponentiation techniques ensures that we avoid overflow issues and improve performance significantly.

## Code

Here's the proposed solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function doubleModularExponentiation(a, b, c, m) {
    // Function to perform modular exponentiation
    function modExp(base, exp, mod) {
        let result = 1;
        base = base % mod;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if (exp % 2 === 1) {
                result = (result * base) % mod;
            }
            exp = Math.floor(exp / 2);
            base = (base * base) % mod;
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    // Step 1: Compute a^b % m
    const temp = modExp(a, b, m);
    
    // Step 2: Compute temp^c % m
    const result = modExp(temp, c, m);
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const a = 2, b = 10, c = 3, m = 1000;
console.log(doubleModularExponentiation(a, b, c, m)); // Output may vary based on input values
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the modular exponentiation function \( modExp \) is \( O(\log \text{exp}) \).
- We call this function twice:
  1. For calculating \( a^b \mod m \)
  2. For calculating \( temp^c \mod m \)

Therefore, the overall time complexity for the double modular exponentiation is:

\[ O(\log b + \log c) \]

This is efficient for reasonably large values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Feel free to run some test cases to verify correctness and understand edge cases better!
