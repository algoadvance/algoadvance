[Leetcode 2716. Minimize String Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2716)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with reducing a given string to its minimum possible length by performing the following operation any number of times:
- Select two adjacent identical characters and remove them, causing the left and right neighbors of the removed characters to become adjacent.

Return the length of the minimized string.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "aabcc"
Output: 1

Input: s = "abba"
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

2. **What should be the output if the input string is empty?**
   - If the input string is empty, the output should also be 0.

3. **Do we need to consider any other special operations or constraints?**
   - No, the main operation is removing pairs of adjacent identical characters.

4. **Is there a maximum length for the input string?**
   - Typical constraints in coding challenges could indicate up to 10^5 for the length.

Given these answers, we can now derive a solution.

## Strategy

The problem can be efficiently solved using a stack. Hereâ€™s the strategy:

1. Iterate through each character of the string.
2. Use a stack to keep track of characters.
3. For each character:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character, pop the top of the stack (remove both characters).
   - Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
4. The length of the stack at the end of the iteration will be the length of the minimized string.

This works because the stack effectively collapses pairs of adjacent identical characters each time they are encountered.

## Code

```javascript
function minimizeStringLength(s) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === char) {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minimizeStringLength("aabcc")); // Output: 1
console.log(minimizeStringLength("abba")); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we process each character once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case if no characters are removed (e.g., when all characters are distinct and not adjacent).

By using the stack data structure to manage collapsing pairs of adjacent identical characters efficiently, we achieve an optimal solution for the problem.
