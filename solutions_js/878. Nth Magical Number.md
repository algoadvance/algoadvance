[Leetcode 878. Nth Magical Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l878)
## Problem Statement

A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

Given the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, return the `n`th magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
1. **Input:** `n = 1`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`
   **Output:** `2`
2. **Input:** `n = 4`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`
   **Output:** `6`
3. **Input:** `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 4`
   **Output:** `10`
4. **Input:** `n = 3`, `a = 6`, `b = 4`
   **Output:** `8`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `2 <= a, b <= 4 * 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are `a` and `b` guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, based on the constraints, `a` and `b` are positive integers.
2. Should the result be given as a non-negative integer even if no such number exists?
   - Since the return is always modulo `10^9 + 7`, it will inherently be a non-negative integer.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We can use binary search to efficiently find the `n`th magical number.
   - **Step 1:** Define our search rangeâ€”initially 1 to `n * min(a, b)`.
   - **Step 2:** Use the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to reduce the number of checks. This is because any number that is a multiple of the LCM will be counted twice if we check individually.
   - **Step 3:** Use binary search to find the smallest number that has at least `n` multiples of either `a` or `b`.

2. **Mathematical Insight with LCM:**
   - Let `lcm_ab = LCM(a, b)`.
   - The count of magical numbers <= `x` is given by: `floor(x / a) + floor(x / b) - floor(x / lcm_ab)`.

Using this, we can iterate and converge to the `n`th magical number.

## Code

Below is the JavaScript implementation using the described approach:

```javascript
function nthMagicalNumber(n, a, b) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    
    // Helper function to compute GCD
    const gcd = (x, y) => {
        while (y !== 0) {
            [x, y] = [y, x % y];
        }
        return x;
    };

    // Compute LCM using GCD
    const lcm = (x, y) => (x * y) / gcd(x, y);

    const lcm_ab = lcm(a, b);
    
    let left = 1;
    let right = n * Math.min(a, b);
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let count = Math.floor(mid / a) + Math.floor(mid / b) - Math.floor(mid / lcm_ab);
        
        if (count < n) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return left % MOD;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity for computing the `n`th magical number using this approach is:
- **Binary Search Part:** `O(log(n * min(a, b)))`, which is logarithmic in terms of the search space.
- **GCD and LCM Calculation:** The GCD can be calculated in `O(log(min(a, b)))` time.

Thus, the overall complexity is efficient given the constraints, providing a logarithmic search mechanism to pinpoint the `n`th magical number. The function handles even the largest possible values of `n` within a reasonable computation time.
