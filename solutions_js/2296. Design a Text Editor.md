[Leetcode 2296. Design a Text Editor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2296)
### Problem Statement

2296. **Design a Text Editor**

Design a text editor with the following functionalities:
- `addText(string)`: Appends the given string to the text editor.
- `deleteText(k)`: Deletes the last `k` characters from the text editor if there are at least `k` characters; otherwise, deletes all the characters in the text editor.
- `cursorLeft(k)`: Moves the cursor `k` positions to the left.
- `cursorRight(k)`: Moves the cursor `k` positions to the right.
- `getText()`: Returns the current text.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Initial Cursor Position**: Where does the cursor start?
   - The cursor starts at the end of the text by default.
2. **Return Value of Functions**: What should `addText`, `deleteText`, `cursorLeft`, and `cursorRight` return?
   - These functions do not need to return any value (they operate on the internal state of the editor).
3. **Edge Cases**: What if `k` is larger than the number of characters for delete/cursor operations?
   - For `deleteText(k)`, if `k` is larger than the existing characters, delete all characters. For cursor movements, move it as far as possible in the given direction.

### Strategy

We can leverage two stacks to efficiently manage text and cursor operations:
- `leftStack` to manage characters to the left of the cursor.
- `rightStack` to manage characters to the right of the cursor.

### Code

```javascript
class TextEditor {
    constructor() {
        this.leftStack = [];
        this.rightStack = [];
    }
    
    addText(text) {
        for (const char of text) {
            this.leftStack.push(char);
        }
    }
    
    deleteText(k) {
        let deletedCount = 0;
        while (k > 0 && this.leftStack.length > 0) {
            this.leftStack.pop();
            k--;
            deletedCount++;
        }
        return deletedCount;
    }
    
    cursorLeft(k) {
        while (k > 0 && this.leftStack.length > 0) {
            this.rightStack.push(this.leftStack.pop());
            k--;
        }
    }
    
    cursorRight(k) {
        while (k > 0 && this.rightStack.length > 0) {
            this.leftStack.push(this.rightStack.pop());
            k--;
        }
    }
    
    getText() {
        return this.leftStack.join('') + this.rightStack.reverse().join('');
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. `addText(string)`: O(n) where n is the length of the string as each character is appended to the stack.
    - In the worst case, it involves pushing every character onto the `leftStack`.

2. `deleteText(k)`: O(k) where k is the number of characters to delete.
    - The complexity is dictated by the need to pop `k` characters from the `leftStack`.

3. `cursorLeft(k)`: O(k), since it involves moving `k` characters from `leftStack` to `rightStack`.

4. `cursorRight(k)`: O(k), since it involves moving `k` characters from `rightStack` to `leftStack`.

5. `getText()`: O(n) where n is the total number of characters, as we join two stacks and reverse one.
    - Note: This could be optimized if the function doesn't require the cursor position reflected in the text.

By using two stacks to manage the cursor position, we achieve efficient insertions and deletions at the cursor point.
