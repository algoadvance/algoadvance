[Leetcode 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l873)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` that contains distinct positive integers, and the array is sorted in increasing order.

A subsequence is derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A Fibonacci-like subsequence is a subset `S` of `arr` such that:
- `S` is a Fibonacci sequence, where the arithmetical condition \(S[i] + S[i+1] = S[i+2]\) is met for all `i + 2 < len(S)`.

Return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return 0.

Example:
```plaintext
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the Fibonacci subsequence have a length less than 3?**
   - No, a Fibonacci sequence needs at least three numbers to satisfy the relation.

2. **Are the elements of `arr` guaranteed to be distinct?**
   - Yes, the elements in `arr` are distinct.

3. **Is the sequence strictly increasing?**
   - Yes, the array `arr` is sorted in increasing order.

## Strategy

1. Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach with a helper data structure to track indices of elements for quick lookup.
2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will keep the length of the Fibonacci-like subsequence ending with `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
3. Utilize a dictionary to store value-to-index mappings for quick access.
4. Iterate through pairs of elements, checking if they can form a Fibonacci-like sequence with any preceding element.
5. Update the `dp` array based on the presence of valid preceding elements to form the sequence.
6. Track the maximum length of any such sequence encountered.

## Code Implementation

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function lenLongestFibSubseq(arr) {
  const index = new Map();
  const n = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    index.set(arr[i], i);
  }

  const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(2));
  let maxLen = 0;

  for (let k = 2; k < n; ++k) {
    for (let j = 1; j < k; ++j) {
      const potentialI = arr[k] - arr[j];
      if (potentialI < arr[j] && index.has(potentialI)) {
        const i = index.get(potentialI);
        dp[j][k] = dp[i][j] + 1;
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp[j][k]);
      }
    }
  }

  return maxLen > 2 ? maxLen : 0;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
console.log(lenLongestFibSubseq(arr)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - We iterate over pairs of indices `(j, k)` forming a double loop, which results in an \( O(n^2) \) complexity.
  - Dictionary operations for indexing are approximately \( O(1) \).

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - We maintain a 2D `dp` array to store subsequence lengths for pairs of indices.
