[Leetcode 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1218)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, the task is to find the length of the longest subsequence in the array which has the property that the difference between consecutive elements is exactly `difference`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of values for the elements of the array `arr`?
   **A:** The elements of the array can be between -10^4 and 10^4.

2. **Q:** What is the range of the length of the array `arr`?
   **A:** The length of the array can be between 1 and 10^5.

3. **Q:** Is the difference value positive or can it be negative as well?
   **A:** The difference value can be any integer, including negative values.
   
4. **Q:** What should be returned if the array is empty?
   **A:** Given the constraints, the array will always have at least one element, so this case does not need specific handling.

### Strategy
The problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming with a hash map (or dictionary). Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Use a hash map (`dp`) to store the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at each value.

2. **DP Update**:
   - Iterate through each element in the array.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, check if `arr[i] - difference` exists in the hash map.
   - If it exists, update `dp[arr[i]]` to be `dp[arr[i] - difference] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, initialize `dp[arr[i]]` to 1 (since the subsequence would only contain the element itself).

3. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value stored in the hash map.

### Code
Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var longestSubsequence = function(arr, difference) {
    // Initialize the hash map to store the longest subsequence lengths for each value
    let dp = new Map();
    // Initialize the length of the longest subsequence
    let maxSeqLength = 0;

    // Iterate over each element in the array
    for (let num of arr) {
        // Calculate the length of the subsequence ending at `num`
        let seqLength = (dp.get(num - difference) || 0) + 1;
        // Update the hash map with the new length
        dp.set(num, seqLength);
        // Update the overall max length
        maxSeqLength = Math.max(maxSeqLength, seqLength);
    }

    return maxSeqLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time operations for each element due to the efficient hash map usage. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of subsequences lengths in the hash map.
