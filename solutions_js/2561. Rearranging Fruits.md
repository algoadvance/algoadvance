[Leetcode 2561. Rearranging Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2561)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the fruits in two baskets. The fruit types are represented as positive integers.

In one move, you can remove any fruit from `basket1` and place it into `basket2`, or you can remove any fruit from `basket2` and place it into `basket1`.

You need to determine the minimum number of moves required to make both baskets contain the same type of fruits in the same quantities.

Return the minimum number of moves needed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays?**
   - Typically, constraints such as size limits can impact the choice of algorithm.
2. **Is it guaranteed that it is always possible to rearrange the fruits to make the baskets identical?**
   - This determines if we need to handle cases where it's not possible.
3. **Do we need to count the minimum moves for an already identical arrangement as zero?**
   - This ensures we correctly handle edge cases.

Let's assume:
- The length of each array is `n`, and both arrays will have the same length.
- It is always possible to rearrange the fruits to ensure both baskets are identical.
- If the arrays are already identical, the required number of moves is zero.

## Strategy

To find the minimum number of moves, the plan is:

1. **Count Frequencies:** Create frequency distributions for both baskets to count occurrences of each fruit.
2. **Determine Differences:** Identify the number of each type of fruit that needs to be moved to balance the baskets.
3. **Balance the Baskets:** Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make the frequencies match by considering the differences.

### Steps:

1. Use two hash maps to count the occurrences of each fruit type in both baskets.
2. Compute the difference in counts for each fruit type.
3. Sum the absolute differences and divide by 2 (since each fruit moved out of one basket into another counts as a single move).

## Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
function minMovesToMakeBasketsEqual(basket1, basket2) {
    const countBasket1 = {};
    const countBasket2 = {};
    
    // Count frequencies of each fruit in both baskets
    for (const fruit of basket1) {
        countBasket1[fruit] = (countBasket1[fruit] || 0) + 1;
    }
    for (const fruit of basket2) {
        countBasket2[fruit] = (countBasket2[fruit] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    // Calculate the necessary moves
    let moves = 0;
    const allFruits = new Set([...basket1, ...basket2]);
    
    for (const fruit of allFruits) {
        const count1 = countBasket1[fruit] || 0;
        const count2 = countBasket2[fruit] || 0;
        
        // Difference in count for this fruit
        moves += Math.abs(count1 - count2);
    }
    
    return moves / 2;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minMovesToMakeBasketsEqual([1, 2, 3, 2], [3, 3, 1, 2])); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies:** O(n) for both baskets, where n is the size of each basket.
- **Calculating Differences:** O(m) where m is the number of unique fruit types.

In total, the time complexity of this approach is O(n + m).

This solution is efficient and handles the problem with a straightforward counting strategy and balancing of differences.
