[Leetcode 1912. Design Movie Rental System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1912)
## Problem Statement

You need to design a system to manage a movie rental service. The system should support the following operations:

1. **Search Movies**
   - Input: A term that is part of the movie's title.
   - Output: List of movies that match the search term, sorted by relevance.
  
2. **Rent Movie**
   - Input: Movie ID and user ID.
   - Operation: Mark the movie as rented by the user.
  
3. **Return Movie**
   - Input: Movie ID and user ID.
   - Operation: Mark the movie as returned and available for rent again.
  
4. **Report Rental History**
   - Input: User ID.
   - Output: List of movies that the user has rented, sorted by date.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of movies or users?**
   - This will help in understanding if we need to optimize for space or time complexity.
2. **Is the rental history only maintained for currently rented movies, or for all past rentals as well?**
   - Determines if we need to keep a long-term history.
3. **What should be done if a movie is rented that is not currently available?**
   - Should we handle waiting lists?

## Code

Let's build a Movie Rental System step by step using JavaScript. We'll use some basic data structures to manage the state of the system.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**
   - A list of movies, each with a unique ID, title, availability status, and rental history.
   - A list of users with their rental histories.

2. **Operations**
   - **Search Movies:** Iterate over the movie list and match titles with the search term.
   - **Rent Movie:** Update the movie's availability and user's rental history.
   - **Return Movie:** Update the movie's availability and user's rental history.
   - **Report Rental History:** Retrieve and sort the rental history for a user.

### Time Complexity

- **Search Movies:** O(n) where n is the number of movies.
- **Rent Movie:** O(1) for updating a movie and user.
- **Return Movie:** O(1) for updating a movie and user.
- **Report Rental History:** O(k log k) where k is the number of rentals by a user.

### Implementation

```javascript
class Movie {
  constructor(id, title) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = title;
    this.isRented = false;
  }
}

class User {
  constructor(id) {
    this.id = id;
    this.rentalHistory = [];
  }
}

class MovieRentalSystem {
  constructor() {
    this.movies = {};
    this.users = {};
  }

  addMovie(id, title) {
    this.movies[id] = new Movie(id, title);
  }

  addUser(id) {
    this.users[id] = new User(id);
  }

  searchMovies(term) {
    const results = [];
    for (const id in this.movies) {
      const movie = this.movies[id];
      if (movie.title.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())) {
        results.push(movie);
      }
    }
    return results;
  }

  rentMovie(movieId, userId) {
    if (!this.movies[movieId].isRented) {
      this.movies[movieId].isRented = true;
      const rental = {
        movieId,
        date: new Date()
      };
      this.users[userId].rentalHistory.push(rental);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Movie is already rented.");
    }
  }

  returnMovie(movieId, userId) {
    if (this.movies[movieId].isRented) {
      this.movies[movieId].isRented = false;
      for (let rental of this.users[userId].rentalHistory) {
        if (rental.movieId === movieId) {
          rental.returned = new Date();
        }
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error("Movie is not currently rented.");
    }
  }

  reportRentalHistory(userId) {
    return this.users[userId].rentalHistory.sort((a, b) => a.date - b.date);
  }
}

// Example usage
const system = new MovieRentalSystem();
system.addMovie(1, "The Shawshank Redemption");
system.addMovie(2, "The Godfather");
system.addUser(1);

system.rentMovie(1, 1);
system.returnMovie(1, 1);

console.log(system.reportRentalHistory(1));
```

In this example, we've defined `Movie`, `User`, and `MovieRentalSystem` classes. The `MovieRentalSystem` class manages the core functionality such as adding movies and users, renting and returning movies, and reporting rental history. Each operation has a fairly straightforward implementation and follows the strategy and complexity discussed above.
