[Leetcode 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1647)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. In one step, you can delete one character in the string.

Return the minimum number of steps required to make the frequency of each character unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we only operating on lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input string `s` will contain only lowercase English letters.

2. **What is the expected length of the input string `s`?**
   - The length of the input string `s` can be from 1 up to \(10^5\).

3. **If the string is already having unique frequencies, do we return 0?**
   - Yes, if all characters already have unique frequencies, we return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each character.

2. **Create a Frequency Map:**
   - Use another hashmap or list to count how many characters have each frequency.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:**
   - Iterate over the frequencies and ensure each frequency is unique by decrementing frequencies where necessary and counting the deletions.

### Code

```javascript
function minDeletions(s) {
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    let frequency = {};
    for (let char of s) {
        frequency[char] = (frequency[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Collect all frequencies
    let freqList = Object.values(frequency);

    // Step 2: Use a set to keep track of used frequencies
    let usedFrequencies = new Set();
    let deletions = 0;

    for (let freq of freqList) {
        while (freq > 0 && usedFrequencies.has(freq)) {
            freq--;
            deletions++;
        }
        usedFrequencies.add(freq);
    }

    return deletions;
}
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We first count how often each character appears in the string using an object `frequency`.

2. **Track Used Frequencies:**
   - We iterate over these frequencies and check if a frequency has already been used (tracked by a set `usedFrequencies`). If a frequency is already used, we decrement the frequency until we find a unused one or reach zero, counting each decrement operation as a deletion.

3. **Final Deletion Count:**
   - The total number of deletions required will be accumulated in the `deletions` variable.

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Count:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Adjust Frequencies:** \(O(k^2)\) where \(k\) is the number of unique characters in the string. However, since \(k \leq 26\) for lowercase English letters, this step is effectively constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\).
