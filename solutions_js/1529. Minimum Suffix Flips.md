[Leetcode 1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1529)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `target` of length `n`. You have another binary string `s` of the same length initially set to all zeros. You want to turn `s` into `target` using the minimum number of "flip" operations.

In one "flip" operation, you can pick any index `i` in `s` and flip all bits from index `i` to index `n - 1` (inclusive). Your task is to return the minimum number of flip operations needed to transform `s` into `target`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Confirming Input and Output**:
   - **Input**: A binary string `target`.
   - **Output**: An integer representing the minimum number of flips needed.
   
2. **Understanding "Flip" Operation**:
   - When we pick an index `i`, all bits from index `i` to the end of the string are flipped. For example, flipping at index 2 in the string "0000" results in "0011".

3. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the string `target` is given by `n` and `n` can be very large, up to 100,000.

### Strategy:

To achieve the minimum number of flips, we can observe the transitions between `0` and `1` in the `target` string.

- We'll iterate through the `target` string and count how many times there is a transition from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.
- Each transition indicates a required flip to match the `target` string from that point to the end.

### Implementation:

We can implement the strategy with a single pass through the `target` string.

```javascript
function minFlips(target) {
    let flips = 0;
    let current = '0'; // This is the initial state of string `s`
    
    for (let i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] !== current) {
            flips++;
            current = target[i];
        }
    }
    
    return flips;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(minFlips("10111")); // Output: 3
console.log(minFlips("101")); // Output: 3
console.log(minFlips("00000")); // Output: 0
console.log(minFlips("001011101")); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `target` string. This is because we only need to iterate through the string once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only need a few integer variables to keep track of the state and count the flips.

By implementing this strategy, we ensure that we get the minimum flips efficiently.
