## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 79: Word Search

Given an `m x n` board and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- The board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the word wrap around the board?**
   - No, the word can only be formed by sequentially adjacent cells.
   
2. **Can we revisit the same cell multiple times?**
   - No, each cell can only be used once while forming the word.

3. **What should be returned if the word is not found?**
   - Return `false`.

4. **Can the input contain empty strings or arrays?**
   - No, as per the constraints, board dimensions and word length are always within the specified constraints.

## Strategy

1. **DFS (Depth-First Search):** To check for each cell, if it can be a starting point of the word.
2. **Backtracking:** To explore all possible paths starting from an initial cell.
3. **Boundary and Validity Checks:** Ensure we don't go out of bounds and cells are not reused.

**Steps:**
1. Loop through every cell in the board and initiate a DFS for each cell.
2. In the DFS function, check if the current cell matches the character in the word.
3. Mark the cell as visited.
4. Recursively check neighboring cells.
5. If any call returns true, return true.
6. If the search fails, backtrack by undoing the visit mark.
7. If no starting cell leads to a complete match, return false.

## Code

```javascript
const exist = (board, word) => {
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;

    const dfs = (i, j, index) => {
        if (index === word.length) return true;
        if (i < 0 || i >= rows || j < 0 || j >= cols || board[i][j] !== word[index]) return false;

        const temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '*'; // mark as visited

        const found = dfs(i + 1, j, index + 1)
                   || dfs(i - 1, j, index + 1)
                   || dfs(i, j + 1, index + 1)
                   || dfs(i, j - 1, index + 1);

        board[i][j] = temp; // backtrack

        return found;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (dfs(i, j, 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n * 4^l)`, where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `l` is the length of the word. Each cell may be visited and backtracked, and in the worst case, each call may explore up to 4 directions.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(l)` for the recursion stack in the worst case where `l` is the length of the word.

Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any further questions.
