[Leetcode 901. Online Stock Span](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l901)
## Problem Statement

You are given a class called `StockSpanner` which calculates the span of a stock’s price for the current day. The span of the stock’s price on a given day is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (up to the current day) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to the price on the current day.

- Implement the `StockSpanner` class:
  - `StockSpanner()`: initializes the object of the class.
  - `int next(int price)`: returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input:
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]

Output:
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation:
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= price <= 10^5`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `next`.

## Clarifying Questions
- Should we handle all prices being the same for a certain period?
  - Yes, the span should reflect the consecutive same values.
- Is there any non-trivial constraint about the input prices?
  - No, prices are arbitrary within the given range.

## Strategy

1. **Use a Stack**: Utilize a stack to keep track of the prices and their spans.
   - Each element in the stack will be a tuple of `(price, span)`. 
   - For each incoming price, pop the stack while the current price is equal to or greater than the stack's top price.
   - Sum the spans while popping to calculate the current span.
   - Push the current price and its span onto the stack.
   - This ensures that the stack always has prices in decreasing order, and we can calculate the span in O(1) on average.

## Code
```javascript
class StockSpanner {
    constructor() {
        this.stack = [];
    }

    next(price) {
        let span = 1;
        while (this.stack.length > 0 && this.stack[this.stack.length - 1][0] <= price) {
            span += this.stack.pop()[1];
        }
        this.stack.push([price, span]);
        return span;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// let stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(100)); // Output: 1
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(80));  // Output: 1
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(60));  // Output: 1
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(70));  // Output: 2
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(60));  // Output: 1
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(75));  // Output: 4
// console.log(stockSpanner.next(85));  // Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

Each price is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.

- **Push Operation**: O(1) for each price.
- **Pop Operation**: Each price will be removed from the stack in O(1) time.

**Overall**: The amortized time complexity per `next` operation is O(1). Given `10^4` calls, this setup is efficient and should easily handle the maximum input size within the constraints.
