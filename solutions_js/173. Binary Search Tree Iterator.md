[Leetcode 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l173)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Implement the `BSTIterator` class:

- `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
  
- `int next()` Moves the pointer to the next smallest number and returns it.
  
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when `next()` is called.

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the BST tree nodes have unique values?
2. Should the `BSTIterator` handle the case of an empty tree?
3. What kind of data structure should we use to initialize the BST?
4. Is there a maximum number of nodes we can expect in the BST?

## Strategy

To implement the BST iterator, we will use the following approach:

1. **In-Order Traversal**:
   - We know that an in-order traversal of a BST returns nodes in ascending order.
   - Our `BSTIterator` class will first initialize by performing an in-order traversal of the entire tree and storing the elements in a list (or stack).

2. **Memory Considerations**:
   - We can use a stack to traverse the BST in an iterative in-order manner, ensuring that we only store nodes that need to be processed.
   
3. **Iterator Operations**:
   - `next()`: Pop an element from the top of the stack and process it.
   - `hasNext()`: Check if the stack is empty or not.

## Time Complexity

- The `next()` and `hasNext()` operations should ideally be O(1) in average time complexity due to the iterative inorder traversal.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

class BSTIterator {
  constructor(root) {
    this.stack = [];
    this._leftmostInorder(root);
  }

  _leftmostInorder(node) {
    while (node !== null) {
      this.stack.push(node);
      node = node.left;
    }
  }

  next() {
    let topNode = this.stack.pop();
    if (topNode.right !== null) {
      this._leftmostInorder(topNode.right);
    }
    return topNode.val;
  }

  hasNext() {
    return this.stack.length > 0;
  }
}

// Example Usage:
// let's construct a BST first
const root = new TreeNode(7, 
                  new TreeNode(3),
                  new TreeNode(15, 
                               new TreeNode(9), 
                               new TreeNode(20)));

const iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
console.log(iterator.next()); // return 3
console.log(iterator.next()); // return 7
console.log(iterator.hasNext()); // return true
console.log(iterator.next()); // return 9
console.log(iterator.hasNext()); // return true
console.log(iterator.next()); // return 15
console.log(iterator.hasNext()); // return true
console.log(iterator.next()); // return 20
console.log(iterator.hasNext()); // return false
```

This implementation ensures that we are efficiently traversing the BST in an in-order manner using a stack, providing the desired functionality for `next` and `hasNext` methods with average O(1) time complexity for these methods.
