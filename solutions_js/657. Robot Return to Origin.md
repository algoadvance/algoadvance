[Leetcode 657. Robot Return to Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l657)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `moves` that represents the movement sequence of a robot. Your task is to determine if the robot returns to its original position after completing all of its moves. The robot starts at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and each move can be represented by a character in the string:
- 'U' for an upward move
- 'D' for a downward move
- 'L' for a leftward move
- 'R' for a rightward move

Return true if the robot returns to the origin, otherwise return false.

### Example 1
```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```

### Example 2
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity:** Can the input string contain lower case letters or other invalid characters? 
   - We'll assume the input string is always valid and contains only 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'.

2. **Empty Input:** What should we return for an empty input string?
   - An empty input string means no moves were made, so the robot is still at the origin and we should return `true`.

Letâ€™s proceed to solve the problem.

## Strategy
1. We can maintain variables `x` and `y` to track the robot's position on the 2D grid.
2. We initialize `x` and `y` to 0 (the origin).
3. We iterate over the given moves string, updating `x` and `y` accordingly:
   - 'U' increases `y` by 1
   - 'D' decreases `y` by 1
   - 'L' decreases `x` by 1
   - 'R' increases `x` by 1
4. After processing all moves, if both `x` and `y` are 0, the robot is back at the origin, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} moves
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var judgeCircle = function(moves) {
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    for (let move of moves) {
        if (move === 'U') {
            y += 1;
        } else if (move === 'D') {
            y -= 1;
        } else if (move === 'L') {
            x -= 1;
        } else if (move === 'R') {
            x += 1;
        }
    }
    return x === 0 && y === 0;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `moves`. We have to process each character in the input string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the variables `x` and `y`.
