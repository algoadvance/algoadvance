[Leetcode 2351. First Letter to Appear Twice](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2351)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice in the string. It is guaranteed that at least one letter will appear twice.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there any constraint on the length of the string?
   - According to typical problem constraints, the length of the string is usually manageable within reasonable bounds.

2. **Character Set**: Are the characters strictly lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the problem confirms that `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

3. **Output Form**: Should the result be the character itself or something else?
   - The result should be the character itself.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a set to track the characters we have already seen as we iterate through the string. When we encounter a character that is already in the set, we return that character as the answer.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen characters.
2. Traverse each character in the string `s`.
3. For each character:
   - If the character is found in the set, return that character.
   - Otherwise, add the character to the set.
4. If we finish traversing the string without finding any duplicates (which shouldn't happen as per problem constraints), we'd typically consider it an error, but in this problem, it is guaranteed that a duplicate exists.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to implement the above strategy:

```javascript
function repeatedCharacter(s) {
    let seenChars = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (seenChars.has(s[i])) {
            return s[i];
        }
        seenChars.add(s[i]);
    }
    
    // Since it is guaranteed that at least one character will appear twice,
    // we don't need to handle the case where no duplicate is found.
}
```

### Example

```javascript
console.log(repeatedCharacter("abca")); // Output: "a"
console.log(repeatedCharacter("abcabc")); // Output: "a"
console.log(repeatedCharacter("abcdabc")); // Output: "a"
console.log(repeatedCharacter("swiss")); // Output: "s"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string once and each operation of checking membership or adding an element in a set is average \(O(1)\).

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) in the worst case, assuming each character in the string is unique until we find the duplicate.
