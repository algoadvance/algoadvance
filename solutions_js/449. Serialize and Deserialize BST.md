## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 449: Serialize and Deserialize BST

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree (BST). There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a BST can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:**
- The encoded string should only contain digits and characters.
- You may work under the assumption that the input BST does not contain duplicates.

**Example:**
```
You may serialize the following tree:

    2
   / \
  1   3

As "[2,1,3]"

You may deserialize it into the following tree structure:

    2
   / \
  1   3
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Format of Serialization:** Is it acceptable to use comma-separated values for the serialization string? For example, `"2,1,3"`
2. **Leaf Nodes:** Are we to handle null nodes explicitly in serialization or are they implied?
3. **Input Format:** What are the expected input types for the serialization and deserialization methods? Is it guaranteed that the input tree is a BST?

For this problem, Iâ€™ll assume:
- We can use a comma-separated string format for serialization.
- We will ignore null nodes since it's a BST and we can derive the structure from a preorder or postorder traversal.

## Strategy

**Serialization:**
1. Use preorder traversal (Root, Left, Right) to serialize the BST.
2. Append nodes values to a string, separated by commas.

**Deserialization:**
1. Use the preorder traversal string.
2. Split the string by commas into an array of node values.
3. Reconstruct the BST by recursively building nodes from the array within the valid value range for a BST.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * Encodes a tree to a single string.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var serialize = function(root) {
    if (!root) return "";
    
    const preorder = (node) => {
        if (!node) return "";
        let leftPart = preorder(node.left);
        let rightPart = preorder(node.right);
        return node.val + (leftPart ? "," + leftPart : "") + (rightPart ? "," + rightPart : "");
    }
    
    return preorder(root);
};

/**
 * Decodes your encoded data to tree.
 *
 * @param {string} data
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var deserialize = function(data) {
    if (!data) return null;

    const nodes = data.split(',').map(Number);
    
    const buildTree = (low, high) => {
        if (!nodes.length || nodes[0] < low || nodes[0] > high) return null;
        
        let val = nodes.shift();
        let node = new TreeNode(val);
        node.left = buildTree(low, val); // Elements < val
        node.right = buildTree(val, high); // Elements > val
        return node;
    }
    
    return buildTree(-Infinity, Infinity);
};

// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}
```

## Time Complexity

**Serialization:**
- The preorder traversal visits each node exactly once.
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST.

**Deserialization:**
- Each recursive call processes one node from the list and constructs its left and right subtrees.
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST.
