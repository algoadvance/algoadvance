[Leetcode 2256. Minimum Average Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2256)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The **average difference** of the `i`-th index is the **absolute difference** between the average of the first `i + 1` elements of `nums` and the average of the last `n - i - 1` elements. Both averages should be **rounded down** to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the **minimum average difference**. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

Example:
```text
Input: nums = [2,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation: The average differences are:
- At index 0: (2)/1 - (4+8)/2 = 2 - 6 = 4
- At index 1: (2+4)/2 - (8)/1 = 3 - 8 = 5
- At index 2: (2+4+8)/3 - 0 = 4 - 0 = 4
The minimum average difference is 4 at index 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the length of the `nums` array be zero?
    - No, the length will be at least 1.
2. Will the numbers in the array be positive, negative, or zero?
    - The numbers can be any integers.

### Strategy
1. **Pre-computation**: Calculate prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute averages.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: Using the pre-computed sums, calculate the average difference for each possible index and keep track of the minimum difference and corresponding index.

### Code
```javascript
function minimumAverageDifference(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 1) return 0;
    
    let totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    let leftSum = 0;
    let rightSum = totalSum;
    
    let minAvgDiff = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let minIndex = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        leftSum += nums[i];
        rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
        
        const leftAvg = Math.floor(leftSum / (i + 1));
        const rightAvg = i === n - 1 ? 0 : Math.floor(rightSum / (n - i - 1));
        
        const currentAvgDiff = Math.abs(leftAvg - rightAvg);
        
        if (currentAvgDiff < minAvgDiff) {
            minAvgDiff = currentAvgDiff;
            minIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    return minIndex;
}

// Example Usage
const nums = [2, 4, 8];
console.log(minimumAverageDifference(nums)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Pre-computation**: Calculating the total sum takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Iterative Calculation**: The loop through the elements takes \(O(n)\) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\). This is efficient given the constraints.
