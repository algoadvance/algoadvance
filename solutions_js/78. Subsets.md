[Leetcode 78. Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l78)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

#### Example
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?
   - The problem assumes any integer values, and usually within a reasonable range.
2. **Duplicacy of Numbers:** Can `nums` contain duplicates?
   - Typically, for subsets problems, `nums` will not have duplicate elements.
3. **Order of Output:** Does the order of subsets in the final output matter?
   - No, the order of subsets in the final output does not matter.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach which systematically explores all possible subsets. Here’s the strategy:

1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty subset.
2. **Recursion:** For each element in `nums`, decide to include it in the current subset or exclude it and recursively call the next element.
3. **Backtracking:** After reaching a subset length equal to the original set, backtrack to explore other possibilities.
4. **Result Collection:** Collect all subsets generated during the recursive traversal.

The backtracking technique allows us to explore all combinations efficiently.

### Code
Here’s the implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var subsets = function(nums) {
    const result = [];
    const subset = [];

    function backtrack(start) {
        result.push([...subset]);

        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            subset.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1);
            subset.pop();
        }
    }

    backtrack(0);
    return result;
};

// Example usage
console.log(subsets([1, 2, 3]));
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of generating all subsets for a given set of `n` elements is O(2^n). 

- **Explanation:** Each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, leading to `2^n` possible subsets. Additionally, copying each subset to the result list takes O(n) time in the worst case.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n * 2^n)**.
