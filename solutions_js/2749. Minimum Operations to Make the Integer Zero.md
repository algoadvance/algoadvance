[Leetcode 2749. Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2749)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers, `num1` and `num2`. In one operation, you can choose one integer `x` such that `0 <= x <= num1`, and subtract x from num1 such that the resulting value is divisible by num2. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make `num1` equal to zero.

**Example:**
- Input: `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 3`
- Output: 2
- Explanation: 
  1. Choose `x = 2`, then num1 changes from 5 to 3 (because 5 - 2 = 3 is divisible by 3)
  2. Choose `x = 3`, then num1 changes from 3 to 0 (because 3 - 3 = 0)

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is `num1` always greater than `num2`?
2. Can `num1` and `num2` be zero? 

Given the problem constraints, it would be unusual to have `num2` as zero since division by zero is not permitted. Let's assume positive integers greater than zero for all input values.

### Strategy
1. Start with `num1` and repeatedly subtract the remainder of `num1 % num2` from `num1`.
2. After each operation, divide `num1` by `num2` and repeat until `num1` is zero.
3. Count the total number of operations performed.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
var minimumOperations = function(num1, num2) {
    let operations = 0;
    
    while (num1 > 0) {
        // Choose the largest x such that after subtraction num1 is divisible by num2
        let remainder = num1 % num2;
        
        if (remainder !== 0) {
            num1 -= remainder;
        } else {
            num1 -= num2;
        }
        
        // Increment operations count
        operations++;
    }
    
    return operations;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minimumOperations(5, 3)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is dependent on the number of operations performed which is proportional to the number of divisions we perform:

- For each iteration, we reduce `num1` significantly since the loop condition checks for `num1 > 0`, and we either take modulo or reduce by `num2`.
- This results in a logarithmic reduction relative to div/mod operation, hence iterating log base `num2` of `num1` times.

Thus, the overall time complexity can be approximated as \( O(\log_{num2}{num1}) \).

This solution is efficient for large numbers of `num1` and `num2` with the assumption constraints hold true.
