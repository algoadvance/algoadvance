[Leetcode 1307. Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1307)
## Problem Statement

Given an equation, represented as words in a list, return if the equation can be satisfied by assigning each letter to a different non-negative digit. The equation in the given words form is always like `words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1] = words[n]`, where all words are summands except the last one.

Each letter is represented by a unique digit, and no word can have leading zeros except for the word "0" itself.

**Example:**
```text
Input: words = ["SEND", "MORE"], result = "MONEY"
Output: True
Explanation: "9567" + "1085" = "10652"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can a word have leading zeros?
    - No, a word cannot have leading zeros except if the word is "0" itself.
    
2. Are there any constraints on the number of words?
    - The words can have a length between 1 to 50 and contain between 1 to 10 unique uppercase English letters.

3. Is the result always non-negative?
    - Yes, since we are dealing with non-negative digits.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Unique Letters:**
   Extract all unique letters from the input words and the result.
   
2. **Permutation and Backtracking:**
   Try assigning each unique letter a digit (0-9) using permutations.
   - Ensure that the leading digit of any word is not zero.
   
3. **Check Validity:**
   For each permutation of digit assignments, check if the equation holds.
   
4. **Optimization Check:**
   Stop early if a valid assignment is found.

We will implement recursive backtracking to generate digit assignments and check for each permutation if it satisfies the equation.

## Code

Here's a possible way to solve this problem in JavaScript:

```javascript
const isSolvable = (words, result) => {
    const letters = new Set();
    for (const word of words) {
        for (const ch of word) {
            letters.add(ch);
        }
    }
    for (const ch of result) {
        letters.add(ch);
    }
    const uniqueLetters = Array.from(letters);
    if (uniqueLetters.length > 10) return false;
    
    const isValid = (map) => {
        const wordToNumber = (word) => {
            let num = 0;
            for (const ch of word) {
                num = num * 10 + map.get(ch);
            }
            return num;
        };
        
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (map.get(words[i][0]) === 0 && words[i].length > 1) return false;
            sum += wordToNumber(words[i]);
        }
        if (map.get(result[0]) === 0 && result.length > 1) return false;
        
        return sum === wordToNumber(result);
    };
    
    const backtrack = (arr, map) => {
        if (arr.length === uniqueLetters.length) {
            if (isValid(map)) return true;
            return false;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (arr.indexOf(i) !== -1) continue;
            map.set(uniqueLetters[arr.length], i);
            arr.push(i);
            if (backtrack(arr, map)) return true;
            arr.pop();
            map.delete(uniqueLetters[arr.length]);
        }
        return false;
    };
    
    return backtrack([], new Map());
};
```

## Time Complexity

The complexity of the problem comes from the permutations of digits which could be factorial in terms of the number of unique letters. Here, assuming there are `n` unique letters:
- **Time Complexity:** O(10^n * n), where `10^n` is the maximum possible permutations and `n` is the validation process for each permutation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the permutations and mappings.

In practice, this approach might be efficient enough for the constraints given (up to 10 unique letters).
