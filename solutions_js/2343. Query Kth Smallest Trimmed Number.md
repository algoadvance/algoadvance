[Leetcode 2343. Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2343)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `nums`, where each string is of equal length and consists only of digits. You are also given a 2D array `queries` where queries[i] = [k, trim], and we have the following:

- Trim each number in `nums` to its rightmost `trim` digits.
- Find the kth smallest trimmed number in the resulting array. If two trimmed numbers are equal, the one with the smaller index in the original array is considered smaller.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the i-th query.

Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = ["102","473","251","814"], queries = [[1,1],[2,3],[4,2],[1,2]]
Output: ["2","473","102","02"]

Explanation:
1st query: Trim to rightmost 1-digit -> ["2","3","1","4"]. The smallest number is "2".
2nd query: Trim to rightmost 3-digits -> ["102","473","251","814"]. The 2nd smallest number is "473".
3rd query: Trim to rightmost 2-digits -> ["02","73","51","14"]. The 4th smallest number is "14".
4th query: Trim to rightmost 2-digits -> ["02","73","51","14"]. The smallest number is "02".
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the length of the string in `nums` vary, or do they all have the same length?
2. What is the maximum possible size of the `nums` list and the `queries` list?
3. Do all string elements of `nums` consist only of numeric digits?
4. Is `k` guaranteed to be a valid index after trimming?
  
## Strategy:

1. For each query [k, trim], trim the rightmost `trim` digits from each number in `nums`.
2. Create a list of tuples containing the trimmed number and its original index.
3. Sort the list of tuples based on the trimmed number. If two numbers are the same, sort by the original index.
4. From the sorted list, find the kth smallest trimmed number.
5. Accumulate the results for each query and return the final list of results.

## Code:

```javascript
var smallestTrimmedNumbers = function(nums, queries) {
    let result = [];

    for (let [k, trim] of queries) {
        let trimmedList = nums.map((num, index) => [num.slice(-trim), index]);

        trimmedList.sort((a, b) => {
            if (a[0] === b[0]) {
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
            return a[0] > b[0] ? 1 : -1;
        });

        result.push(nums[trimmedList[k - 1][1]]);
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
// console.log(smallestTrimmedNumbers(["102","473","251","814"], [[1, 1], [2, 3], [4, 2], [1, 2]]));
```

## Time Complexity:

- Trimming the numbers will take O(n) for each query, where n is the number of strings in `nums`.
- Sorting the trimmed numbers will take O(n log n) for each query.
- Given that there are `m` queries, the overall time complexity is O(m * n log n).
