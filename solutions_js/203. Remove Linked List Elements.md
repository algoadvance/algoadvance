[Leetcode 203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l203)
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that have `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What should we return if the resulting list is empty?
   - **A**: Return `null`.

2. **Q**: Can the input linked list be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the input can be empty (i.e., `head` can be `null`).

3. **Q**: Will the input have nodes that are not integers?
   - **A**: No, all node values will be integers as per the problem statement.

4. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes and the length of the linked list?
   - **A**: There are no specific constraints provided, assume node values fit within standard integer range and the list length can be reasonably large.

### Strategy
1. **Edge Cases**: Handle the empty list case by returning `null`.
2. **Initialization**: Use a dummy head node that points to the actual head of the list to simplify edge cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
3. **Traversal**:
   - Use a pointer `current` initialized to the dummy node.
   - Traverse the list, checking if `current.next` is the node that needs to be removed.
   - If so, adjust the pointers to bypass the node.
   - Otherwise, move the `current` pointer to the next node.
4. **Completion**: After traversal, return `dummy.next` which points to the new head of the list.

### Code
```javascript
function removeElements(head, val) {
    // Initialize a dummy node to simplify edge cases
    let dummy = { val: -1, next: head };
    let current = dummy; // Start from dummy node
    
    while (current.next !== null) {
        if (current.next.val === val) {
            // Remove the node by skipping over it
            current.next = current.next.next;
        } else {
            // Move to the next node
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the new head, which is the next of dummy node
    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The algorithm involves a single traversal of the linked list:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we are visiting each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach is efficient and handles all edge cases gracefully, providing the correct new head for the modified list.
