[Leetcode 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2452)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of words and a list of dictionary entries, write a function to find all words that are within two edits of at least one word in the dictionary. An edit can be:
- Replacing a character
- Inserting a character
- Deleting a character

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the words list and dictionary?**
   - The length of the words list and dictionary can vary, but let's assume they are manageable to process in a reasonable time.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the words and dictionary?**
   - Typically, these are lowercase English letters.

3. **Should the function be case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, we will assume the function is case-sensitive and only deals with lowercase alphabets.

4. **Do the words and dictionary contain unique entries or could there be duplicates?**
   - Let's assume the inputs do not contain duplicates for simplicity.

### Strategy

1. **Character Replacement**: Check how many characters differ between the two words.
2. **Insertion and Deletion**: Use a dynamic programming approach similar to the Levenshtein distance algorithm to calculate the minimum number of edits (insertions or deletions).

To efficiently implement this:
a. For each word in the given words list, we will check against each word in the dictionary.
b. We will verify if the word can be transformed into any dictionary word within two edits using the helper function `isWithinTwoEdits`.

### Code

```javascript
const isWithinTwoEdits = (word1, word2) => {
    let len1 = word1.length, len2 = word2.length;
    if (Math.abs(len1 - len2) > 2) return false;

    let dp = Array.from({length: len1 + 1}, () => Array(len2 + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i <= len1; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
    for (let j = 0; j <= len2; j++) dp[0][j] = j;

    for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[len1][len2] <= 2;
};

const wordsWithinTwoEdits = (words, dictionary) => {
    let result = [];
    for (let word of words) {
        for (let dictWord of dictionary) {
            if (isWithinTwoEdits(word, dictWord)) {
                result.push(word);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
};

// Example usage:
let words = ["apple", "aple", "mango"];
let dictionary = ["appe", "banana", "angoo"];

console.log(wordsWithinTwoEdits(words, dictionary)); // Output: ["apple", "aple", "mango"]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Word Comparison**: The comparison of two words with dynamic programming is O(m * n), where `m` is the length of one word and `n` is the length of the other word.
- **Overall Complexity**: Given `w` words and `d` dictionary entries, the overall complexity is O(w * d * m * n). This assumes checking each word in the list against each word in the dictionary using the dynamic programming approach.
