[Leetcode 479. Largest Palindrome Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l479)
### Problem Statement

**479. Largest Palindrome Product**

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two `n`-digit numbers.

Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the range of `n` that we might need to handle?
   - Typically, constraints may require handling up to 8 or 9 digit numbers for `n`.

2. **Definition of Palindrome**: A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 or 9009.

3. **Example**:
   - For `n = 2`, we need to consider products in the range of 10 to 99.
   - The largest palindrome from the product of two 2-digit numbers (99 x 91) is 9009.

### Strategy

1. **Range of Products**:
   - Determine the maximum and minimum `n`-digit number. For example, for `n = 2`, this will be 99 (max) and 10 (min).

2. **Check Palindrome**:
   - Create a helper function to check if a number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and checking if it reads the same forward and backward.

3. **Iterate and Check**:
   - Iterate over all possible products of `n`-digit numbers starting from the maximum and reducing. For each product, check if it is a palindrome.
   - Track the maximum palindrome encountered.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Given the constraints, apply the `% 1337` operation to the result before returning it.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestPalindrome = function(n) {
    if (n === 1) return 9; // Special case for single digit numbers

    let upperLimit = Math.pow(10, n) - 1;
    let lowerLimit = Math.pow(10, n - 1);
    let maxPalindrome = 0;

    for (let i = upperLimit; i >= lowerLimit; i--) {
        for (let j = i; j >= lowerLimit; j--) {
            let product = i * j;
            if (product <= maxPalindrome) break; // Products will decrease afterwards
            if (isPalindrome(product)) {
                maxPalindrome = Math.max(maxPalindrome, product);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxPalindrome % 1337;
};

function isPalindrome(num) {
    let str = num.toString();
    let reverseStr = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    return str === reverseStr;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(largestPalindrome(2)); // Output: 987 (largest palindrome is 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: Runs from `upperLimit` to `lowerLimit`, which is O(10^n).
- **Inner Loop**: Similar range, which gives O(10^n) as well.
- **Palindrome Check**: O(k) where k is the number of digits in the product (approximately O(n)).

Overall complexity: O((10^n)^2 * n) which simplifies approximately to O(10^(2n)) for large `n`.

### Explanation
1. We start the product loops from the highest `n`-digit number down to the lowest.
2. For each product, we check if itâ€™s a palindrome using a helper function.
3. We keep track of the maximum palindrome found.
4. Finally, return the result modulo 1337 as per the problem's requirements.
