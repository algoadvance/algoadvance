[Leetcode 653. Two Sum IV ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l653)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a target number `k`, return `true` if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to the given target.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input:** 
   - What is the format of the input (e.g., a tree node or an array representation of the tree)?
     - The input is provided as a tree node (i.e., the root of the BST).
   
2. **Null root:**
   - Should we consider the case when the root is `null`?
     - Generally, we assume the input will be valid, but we should handle `null` root case, returning `false`.
   
3. **Node values:**
   - Can node values be negative?
     - Yes, node values can be any integer.

4. **Duplicate values:**
   - Will there be duplicate values in the BST?
     - In a typical BST, there will not be duplicate values.

### Strategy

1. **In-Order Traversal:**
   - Perform an in-order traversal to convert the BST to a sorted array.
   - A BST's in-order traversal gives elements in ascending order.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Use a two-pointer technique to find if there exist two numbers in the sorted array that add up to `k`.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}

var findTarget = function(root, k) {
    if (!root) return false;
    
    // Perform in-order traversal to get sorted array of node values
    const nums = [];
    const inOrderTraversal = (node) => {
        if (!node) return;
        inOrderTraversal(node.left);
        nums.push(node.val);
        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    };
    inOrderTraversal(root);
    
    // Use two-pointer technique to find if there exist two numbers that add to k
    let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        const sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
        if (sum === k) return true;
        if (sum < k) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **In-Order Traversal:**
   - We define `inOrderTraversal` to collect the values from the BST in sorted order into the `nums` array.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - We initialize pointers `left` and `right` at the start and end of the `nums` array.
   - We iterate with the following logic:
     - Compute the sum of elements pointed to by `left` and `right`.
     - If the sum equals `k`, return `true`.
     - If the sum is less than `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right.
     - If the sum is greater than `k`, move the `right` pointer to the left.
   - If no such pair is found, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **In-Order Traversal:**
  - Takes `O(N)` time where `N` is the number of nodes in the BST.
  
- **Two-Pointer Search:**
  - Takes `O(N)` time in the worst case.

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - Total time complexity is `O(N)` due to in-order traversal and subsequent two-pointer search.
  - Space complexity is `O(N)` to store the elements in the `nums` array.

This approach efficiently utilizes the properties of BST and the two-pointer technique to solve the problem within linear time complexity.
