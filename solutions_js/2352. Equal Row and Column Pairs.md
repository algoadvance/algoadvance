[Leetcode 2352. Equal Row and Column Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2352)
### Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix `grid`, return the number of pairs `(r, c)` such that row `r` and column `c` are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if all elements in the row are the same as the corresponding elements in the column.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What are the possible values of `m` and `n`? 
    - We should assume typical constraints for matrix problems, where `m, n <= 500`.
2. **Element Range**: What are the possible values for the elements in the grid?
    - Typically, the elements can range from `-10^3` to `10^3`, but we should confirm.
3. **Square Matrix**: Is the matrix always square? 
    - No, the matrix can be any m x n dimensions, not necessarily square.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[2,4,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only pair that matches here is (2,2) as the third row and third column are both [1, 3, 1].
```

Based on these clarifying points, let's proceed to the strategy and the implementation.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through Rows and Columns**: For each row, convert it into a string or tuple to make it easy to compare. Do the same for each column.
2. **Hashmap for Count**: Use a hashmap (or dictionary) to count the frequency of each unique row and column.
3. **Compare**: For each unique row pattern found, check if the same pattern exists in the columns and count those pairs.

### Code
```javascript
var equalPairs = function(grid) {
    const rowMap = new Map();
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    // Convert rows to strings and count them
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        const rowKey = grid[i].join(',');
        rowMap.set(rowKey, (rowMap.get(rowKey) || 0) + 1);
    }

    let count = 0;

    // Convert columns to strings and count matches
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        let colArray = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            colArray.push(grid[i][j]);
        }
        const colKey = colArray.join(',');
        if (rowMap.has(colKey)) {
            count += rowMap.get(colKey);
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Row Processing**: Converting each row into a string takes O(n) time. This process for all rows takes O(m * n).
2. **Column Processing**: Converting each column into a string also takes O(m) time. Doing this for all columns takes O(m * n).
3. **HashMap Operations**: Insertion and lookup in a hashmap are O(1) on average, so these operations are negligible compared to the string conversion steps.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**.

### Edge Cases

1. **All elements are distinct**: The function should return 0.
2. **Single row or column**: The function should correctly count these cases.
3. **Empty Grid**: The function should handle edge cases gracefully (though typically you might assume grid always has at least 1 element in practical coding interviews).

By handling these edge cases and following the discussed strategy, the provided solution should accurately compute the number of equal row and column pairs in the given grid.
