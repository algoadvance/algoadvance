[Leetcode 2920. Maximum Points After Collecting Coins From All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2920)
### Problem Statement:

Consider a tree consisting of `n` nodes labeled `1` to `n`. Each node has a certain number of coins. One can collect coins by following any simple path between two nodes and collect all the coins present in the nodes along the way. 

Given the tree's node connections and the coins in each node, determine the maximum points that can be collected by traversing any simple path between two nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Clarification on input format:**
   - Are the tree connections given in terms of edges (i.e., pairs of nodes)?
   - Is there any specific range for the number of nodes and the number of coins in each node?

2. **Constraints:**
   - Can the tree contain negative coins?
   - Can we assume that the tree is always connected and acyclic?

Assuming the typical constraints:
  - Given `n` nodes where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
  - Each node has an integer number of coins.
  - Coins can be positive or negative.
  - The tree is connected and acyclic.

### Strategy:

To solve the problem of finding the maximum coin collection between any two nodes in a tree, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to find the maximum path sum.

1. **Double DFS Approach:**
   - First, conduct a DFS from any arbitrary node (let's pick node 1) to find the furthest node from it. Let's call this node `A`.
   - Second, conduct a DFS from the node `A` to find the furthest node from `A`, denote this node as `B`. The distance between `A` and `B` in terms of the maximum coin collection will give us the desired result as all simple paths are considered in these runs.
   
2. **Calculation:**
   - For each DFS, we capture and propagate the maximum sum of coins collected until we reach the furthest nodes.
   - In the first DFS, record the node where the maximum sum of coins is collected to determine the furthest node, and then re-do the DFS from that specific node.

### Time Complexity:

- Each DFS traversal takes `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Since we perform the DFS twice, the overall time complexity would be `O(n)`.

### Code:

```javascript
function maxPointsInTree(n, edges, coins) {
    // Step 1: Create an adjacency list for the tree
    let adjList = new Map();
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        adjList.set(i, []);
    }
    
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adjList.get(u).push(v);
        adjList.get(v).push(u);
    }

    // Helper function to perform DFS, return [maxSumPath, nodeAtEndOfPath]
    function dfs(node, parent) {
        let maxSubtreeSum = coins[node - 1];
        let endNode = node;
        
        for (const neighbor of adjList.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor !== parent) {
                const [subtreeSum, subtreeEndNode] = dfs(neighbor, node);
                const totalSum = subtreeSum + coins[node - 1];
                if (totalSum > maxSubtreeSum) {
                    maxSubtreeSum = totalSum;
                    endNode = subtreeEndNode;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return [maxSubtreeSum, endNode];
    }
    
    // Perform the first DFS from any node, let's start from node 1
    const [_, furthestNodeFromStart] = dfs(1, -1);
    
    // Perform the second DFS from furthestNodeFromStart
    const [maxSum, _] = dfs(furthestNodeFromStart, -1);
    
    // The result is the maximum sum found in the second DFS
    return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
// Number of nodes
const n = 4;
// Edges of the tree
const edges = [
    [1, 2],
    [2, 3],
    [3, 4]
];
// Coins at each node
const coins = [4, -1, 2, 3];

console.log(maxPointsInTree(n, edges, coins)); // Expected output would be the max coins collectable in the optimal path.
```

This solution will correctly determine the maximum coins that can be collected from any simple path in the tree using the outlined DFS method.
