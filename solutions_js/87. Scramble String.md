[Leetcode 87. Scramble String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l87)
### Problem Statement

We need to determine if one string is a scrambled version of another string. A scrambled string is obtained by recursively dividing a string into two non-empty substrings and swapping them if necessary.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length Constraints**: What is the length range for the strings?
   - Typically, in interview settings, constraints will be reasonable, like the length of strings could be up to 100 characters.

2. **Character Set**: What characters do the strings contain?
   - Generally, it will be lowercase English characters (a-z).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Two empty strings?
   - Two identical strings?
   - Strings with a single character?

For simplicity, let's assume that the input strings contain only lowercase English characters and have a non-zero length.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) as it involves solving overlapping subproblems and has optimal substructure. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `s1` and `s2` are equal, return `true`.
   - If the sorted characters of `s1` and `s2` are not equal, return `false` (quick check to filter out impossible cases).

2. **Recursive Check**:
   - Try dividing `s1` into two parts at every possible index and check if `s2` can be split similarly to form a valid scramble. For each split:
     - Either the first part of `s1` matches the first part of `s2` and the second part of `s1` matches the second part of `s2`.
     - Or the first part of `s1` matches the second part of `s2` and the second part of `s1` matches the first part of `s2`.

3. **DP Table**:
   - Use a 3-dimensional DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents whether `s1.substr(i, k)` is a scrambled string of `s2.substr(j, k)`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s1
 * @param {string} s2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
const isScramble = function(s1, s2) {
    const n = s1.length;
    if (n !== s2.length) return false;
    if (s1 === s2) return true;

    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => 
        Array.from({ length: n }, () => 
            Array(n + 1).fill(false)
        )
    );

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j][1] = (s1[i] === s2[j]);
        }
    }

    for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j <= n - len; j++) {
                for (let k = 1; k < len; k++) {
                    if ((dp[i][j][k] && dp[i + k][j + k][len - k]) ||
                        (dp[i][j + len - k][k] && dp[i + k][j][len - k])) {
                        dp[i][j][len] = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[0][0][n];
};

// Example usage
console.log(isScramble("great", "rgeat"));  // Output: true
console.log(isScramble("abcde", "caebd"));  // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^4)\). This is because:
1. There are \(n^2\) subproblem pairs (for each starting index pair in both strings).
2. Each subproblem checks up to \( n \) possible divisions.
3. Each check involves fixed operations, thus making the overall complexity \(O(n^4)\).
