[Leetcode 458. Poor Pigs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l458)
## Problem Statement

There are `buckets` buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you have some "poor pigs" that you can use for testing until they die (from drinking the poison). Through a series of tests, the goal is to determine which bucket contains the poison. Each test takes `minutesToTest` minutes to complete, and you can test as many buckets as you like in a single test. However, the pigs will die `minutesToDie` minutes after drinking the poison, and you cannot use the same pig for another test after it dies.

You need to determine the minimum number of pigs required to figure out which bucket is poisonous within `minutesToTest` minutes.

### Assumptions:
- You can reuse the pigs between tests while they are alive.
- A test involves assigning pigs to drink out of buckets, which gives you one result within `minutesToDie` minutes.
  
Given three integers `buckets`, `minutesToDie`, and `minutesToTest`, return the minimum number of pigs required to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.

### Example:
```
Input: buckets = 1000, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60
Output: 5
Explanation: 
15 minutes / 60 minutes = 4 tests max
Hence, using 4 pig tests, 5 pigs are required to identify the lethal bucket in 1000 buckets.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can pigs be tested multiple times if they survive the prior tests?
   - Yes, pigs can be reused multiple times as long as they are alive.
  
2. What is the significance of the ratio `minutesToTest / minutesToDie`?
   - This ratio determines the maximum number of tests we can perform within the given time limit.

3. Can we assume that "poor pigs" have infinite health if they do not consume poison in a given test?
   - Yes, pigs that do not drink the poison can be reused indefinitely.

## Strategy

The problem is essentially about combining the outcomes from different tests to uniquely identify the poisonous bucket. With each test, we get some new binary information (dead or alive), and we need to maximize the number of different outcomes (states) we can distinguish using these tests.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine number of possible states (`tests + 1`) each pig can have within the given time frame**:
   - `numTests = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie)`
   - Since a pig can either survive or die, each pig adds `numTests + 1` possible outcomes or states.

2. **Calculate the total number of states we need to distinguish**:
   - This can be represented as `states^pigs >= buckets`, where `states` is `numTests + 1`.

3. **Find the minimum number of pigs required**:
   - Use the minimum number of pigs `p` such that `(numTests + 1)^p >= buckets`.

## Code

```javascript
function poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) {
    const numTests = Math.floor(minutesToTest / minutesToDie) + 1;
    let pigs = 0;

    while (Math.pow(numTests, pigs) < buckets) {
        pigs++;
    }

    return pigs;
}

// Example Usage:
// buckets = 1000, minutesToDie = 15, minutesToTest = 60
console.log(poorPigs(1000, 15, 60)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log(buckets) / log(numTests)), since in the worst case, we perform a logarithmic number of multiplications/divisions until we find the minimal number of pigs.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant space used for variables and calculations.

This logic efficiently computes the minimum number of pigs needed to determine the poisonous bucket within the constraints provided.
