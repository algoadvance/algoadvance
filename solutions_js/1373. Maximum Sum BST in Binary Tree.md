[Leetcode 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1373)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree `root`, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any subtree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a single node be considered a valid BST?**
   - Yes, a single node is trivially a BST.
2. **Can the input tree contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the nodes can have negative values.
3. **What should be returned if there are no BST subtrees?**
   - If there are no valid BST subtrees, the result should be 0.

### Strategy

1. **Post-order Traversal**: We need to traverse the tree in a post-order manner because we need to calculate values from the leaves up to the root.
2. **Tracking Values**: For each node, keep track of:
   - Whether the subtree rooted at the node is a BST.
   - The minimum and maximum values within this subtree.
   - The sum of all nodes' values within this subtree.
3. **Update Maximum Sum**: While traversing, if a valid BST is found, update the maximum sum accordingly.
4. **Combining Results**: Use the results from left and right subtrees to ascertain the properties for the current node.

### Code

```javascript
function maxSumBST(root) {
  let maxSum = 0;

  const traverse = (node) => {
    if (!node) {
      // Base case for null nodes
      return [true, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER, 0];
    }
    
    const [leftIsBST, leftMin, leftMax, leftSum] = traverse(node.left);
    const [rightIsBST, rightMin, rightMax, rightSum] = traverse(node.right);

    const currentVal = node.val;

    // Check if the current node forms a BST with its left and right subtrees
    if (leftIsBST && rightIsBST && leftMax < currentVal && currentVal < rightMin) {
      const currentSum = leftSum + rightSum + currentVal;
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
      const minVal = Math.min(leftMin, currentVal);
      const maxVal = Math.max(rightMax, currentVal);
      return [true, minVal, maxVal, currentSum];
    } else {
      return [false, 0, 0, 0];
    }
  };

  traverse(root);

  return maxSum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the given solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal. The space complexity is **O(h)**, where **h** is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

### Explanation

- `traverse(node)` is a recursive function that processes the subtree rooted at `node`.
- For each node, we calculate whether it's part of a valid BST, keeping track of local minima, maxima, and subtree sums.
- The `maxSum` variable keeps track of the highest sum encountered during the traversal.

This strategy ensures that we correctly identify the maximum sum of all keys of any BST subtree within the given binary tree.
