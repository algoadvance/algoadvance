[Leetcode 1095. Find in Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1095)
### Problem Statement

This is an interactive problem.

You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the minimum index such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

You cannot directly access the array, you have to use the `MountainArray` interface which provides the following methods:
- `MountainArray.get(index)`: Returns the element of the array at index `index` (0-indexed).
- `MountainArray.length()`: Returns the length of the array.

You must implement `findInMountainArray` function:
```javascript
findInMountainArray(target: number, mountainArr: MountainArray): number
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can you explain how the MountainArray interface works?**
   - The `MountainArray` interface has two main methods: `get(index)` and `length()`. You will need to use these methods to interact with the array.

2. **Is there a performance constraint we need to be aware of?**
   - Yes, since the interface does not allow direct access to the array elements, making multiple calls to `get` can be costly. We need an efficient approach to minimize the number of `get` calls.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Find the Peak Element**:
   - Use a binary search to find the peak element of the mountain array. This is the element that is greater than its neighbors.

2. **Binary Search on Both Sides of the Peak**:
   - Use binary search on the increasing part of the array (left of the peak).
   - Use binary search on the decreasing part of the array (right of the peak).
   - Return the first found index or -1 if the target is not found.

### Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} target
 * @param {MountainArray} mountainArr
 * @return {number}
 */
function findInMountainArray(target, mountainArr) {
    const length = mountainArr.length();
    
    // Helper function to find the peak of the mountain array.
    const findPeak = (left, right) => {
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    // Helper function to perform binary search.
    const binarySearch = (left, right, target, ascending) => {
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            const midValue = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midValue === target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (ascending) {
                if (midValue < target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (midValue > target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    const peak = findPeak(0, length - 1);
    const result = binarySearch(0, peak, target, true);
    if (result !== -1) {
        return result;
    }
    return binarySearch(peak + 1, length - 1, target, false);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Finding the peak element takes `O(log n)` time.
- Each binary search (on either side of the peak) takes `O(log n)` time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`.

This approach ensures efficient querying of the MountainArray interface and is optimal for the given problem constraints.
