[Leetcode 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l128)
### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain duplicate numbers? (Assumption: Yes, it can have duplicates, but our objective is to find unique consecutive sequences.)
2. What if the array is empty? (Assumption: The result should be 0 for an empty array.)
3. Are negative numbers allowed in the input array? (Assumption: Yes.)

### Strategy
1. Utilize a `Set` to remove all duplicates and provide `O(1)` time complexity for look-up operations.
2. Iterate through the elements of the array and for each element, check if it is the starting point of a sequence (i.e., `num - 1` is not in the `Set`).
3. If it is a starting point, then iterate through the consecutive numbers to find the length of the sequence.
4. Keep track of the maximum sequence length encountered and return it.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (const num of numSet) {
        // Check if this is the start of a sequence
        if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            let currentNum = num;
            let currentLength = 1;

            while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2];
console.log(longestConsecutive(nums)); // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the `Set` from the array takes `O(n)` time.
- The main loop where we look for the start of sequences iterates through the `Set`, which can take up to `O(n)` time in the worst case.
- Inside the loop, each number is processed only once because we skip numbers that are not the start of a sequence.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the longest consecutive sequence in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
