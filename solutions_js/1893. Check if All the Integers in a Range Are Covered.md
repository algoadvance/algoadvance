[Leetcode 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1893)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents an inclusive interval. 

Return `true` *if every integer in the inclusive range* `[left, right]` *is covered by at least one interval in* `ranges`. Return `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered (i.e., 2, 3, 4, and 5).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any interval.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the ranges overlap? 
    - Yes, the ranges can overlap.
    
2. Can the intervals be unordered?
    - Yes, the intervals can be given in any order.
    
3. What is the maximum possible value for `left` and `right`?
    - Constraints are not mentioned, but usually, for such problems, values are within the range of 32-bit integers.

4. What happens if `left` is greater than `right`?
    - Such a case is invalid based on the problem statement.

## Strategy

The main idea is to check if every integer from `left` to `right` is covered by at least one of the intervals in `ranges`. 

Here's the strategy to solve the problem:
1. Create an array `covered` of size large enough to cover all integers in the given ranges.
2. Iterate through each interval in `ranges` and mark the positions in `covered` as `true`.
3. Finally, iterate from `left` to `right` and check if all those positions are marked as `true`.

## Code

```javascript
function isCovered(ranges, left, right) {
    const covered = new Array(51).fill(false); // Assuming we only need to check within 1-50 due to typical problem constraints

    // Mark the ranges as covered
    for (const [start, end] of ranges) {
        for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            covered[i] = true;
        }
    }

    // Check if all numbers from left to right are covered
    for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if (!covered[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isCovered([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], 2, 5)); // Output: true
console.log(isCovered([[1,10],[10,20]], 21, 21)); // Output: false
```

## Time Complexity

- **Marking ranges**: O(n * m) where `n` is the number of ranges and `m` is the average length of each range.
- **Checking ranges**: O(k) where `k` is the length of the target range `[left, right]`.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * m + k).
