### Problem Statement

**1449. Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add Up to Target**

Given an array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i + 1`-th digit (1-indexed), and an integer `target`, return the largest integer you can obtain by using digits with a total cost of exactly `target`. If you cannot obtain any integer, return "0".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of input values?**
   - `cost` array will have a length of 9.
   - `target` will be a positive integer.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the digits to form the largest integer?**
   - The integer should be formed by using digits from 1 to 9.

3. **What should we return if no valid integer can be formed?**
   - Return the string "0".

4. **How should I handle leading zeros?**
   - Leading zeros are not a concern as we will always pick the max possible digits, ensuring the leading digit is the largest possible non-zero digit.

### Strategy

#### Dynamic Programming Approach

- Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem. Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` keeps the largest integer (represented as a string) that can be constructed with a total cost of `i`.
- Initialize `dp[0]` to an empty string because a cost of 0 means no digits.
- Iterate through all possible costs from `1` to `target`.
- For each cost, iterate through the digits 1 through 9 and update the DP states.
- For each digit `d` (and its corresponding `cost[d-1]`), if the current cost `i` is at least `cost[d-1]`, determine if using this digit results in a larger integer than the current value in `dp[i]`.
- After populating the DP array, the value at `dp[target]` holds the required result.

### Code

```javascript
function largestNumber(cost, target) {
    let dp = new Array(target + 1).fill("");
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
        for (let d = 1; d <= 9; d++) {
            let cost_d = cost[d - 1];
            if (i >= cost_d) {
                let candidate = dp[i - cost_d];
                
                if (candidate !== null) {
                    candidate = d.toString() + candidate;
                    if (dp[i].length < candidate.length || (dp[i].length === candidate.length && candidate > dp[i])) {
                        dp[i] = candidate;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[target] === "" ? "0" : dp[target];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution involves iterating through the costs and digits in a nested loop:

- **Outer Loop:** Iterating through `i` from `1` to `target` — O(target)
- **Inner Loop:** Iterating through digits `1` to `9` for each `i` — O(9) which is O(1) (constant time complexity)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

- **O(target * 9)** which simplifies to **O(target)**.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is determined by the DP array, which has a size of `target + 1`.
- Thus, the space complexity is **O(target)**.

This solution is efficient and ensures that we find the largest possible integer conforming to the specified constraints.
