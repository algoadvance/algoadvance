[Leetcode 2197. Replace Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2197)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subset of this array is defined as non-coprime if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the subset's elements is greater than 1. Replace every such subset with their least common multiple (LCM) until the list contains only coprime numbers.

Return the resulting array.

### Example
**Input:** `nums = [6, 4, 3, 2]`  
**Output:** `[12, 3, 2]`  

**Explanation:** 
- [6,4] are not coprime because gcd(6, 4) = 2; replace [6,4] with lcm(6, 4) = 12.
- The array is now [12, 3, 2].
- Continuing with the same process, final array is [12, 3, 2].

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of `nums`?
2. Can the array contain 1, as its GCD with any number is always 1?
3. Are there any constraints on the values within the array? e.g. upper and lower bounds?

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the array, checking pairs of numbers.
2. If any two numbers are not coprime, replace them with their LCM.
3. Continue the process until all consecutive pairs of numbers are coprime.
4. Utilize helper functions to compute GCD and LCM.

To determine whether two numbers are coprime, we will use the following properties:
- Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD.
- LCM can be computed using `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.

### Code
```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        const temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

function lcm(a, b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

function replaceNonCoprimes(nums) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        while (stack.length > 0) {
            let top = stack[stack.length - 1];
            if (gcd(top, num) > 1) {
                num = lcm(top, num);
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        stack.push(num);
    }
    
    return stack;
}

// Example Usage
let nums = [6, 4, 3, 2];
console.log(replaceNonCoprimes(nums));  // Output: [12, 3, 2]
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating GCD for each pair takes O(log(min(a, b))), where a and b are the numbers being compared.
- The LCM computation also involves O(log(min(a, b))) and a multiplication/division operation.
- In the worst case, each number might need to be processed multiple times if multiple replacements happen consecutively.

Thus, if `n` is the length of the array, the overall time complexity is potentially O(n log M), where M is the maximum number in the array.

### Conclusion
This solution ensures all numbers in the resulting array are only coprime with their neighboring numbers by iteratively replacing subsets of non-coprime numbers with their LCM. The use of a stack helps manage the iterative process efficiently.
