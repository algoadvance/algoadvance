[Leetcode 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2071)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `tasks` and `workers` of length `n` and `m` respectively, along with an integer `p` that provides the personal capability increase limit, and another integer `strength` which provides the total strength limit for workers. Each element in `tasks` represents the strength required to complete a particular task, and each element in `workers` represents the capability of a particular worker. You need to assign tasks to workers such that the number of tasks assigned is maximized. A task can be assigned to a worker if and only if:

1. The worker's capability plus a personal increase (up to `p`) is at least the strength required for the task.
2. The total added personal increases across all assigned workers do not exceed `strength`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are the arrays `tasks` and `workers` sorted?**
   - **A: No, the arrays may not be sorted, and sorting them is allowed as part of the solution.**

2. **Q: Can a worker be assigned more than one task?**
   - **A: No, each worker can handle at most one task.**

3. **Q: What should be returned?**
   - **A: Return the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to the workers.**

4. **Q: Can the sum of the elements of `tasks` exceed the sum of the elements of `workers` plus their personal increases?**
   - **A: Yes, that is possible, and we need to ensure that the constraints are met.**

### Strategy

1. **Sort the arrays** `tasks` and `workers` to make it easier to assign tasks using a greedy approach.
2. **Binary Search for capacity**: Use binary search to find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned.
3. For each midpoint in binary search, **greedily check if that number of tasks can be assigned** under the given constraints using two pointers technique and heaps.

### Code

```javascript
function maxTasksAssignable(tasks, workers, p, strength) {
    tasks.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    workers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = Math.min(tasks.length, workers.length);

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.ceil((left + right) / 2);
        if (canAssign(tasks, workers, mid, p, strength)) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}

function canAssign(tasks, workers, k, p, strength) {
    if (k === 0) return true;
    let i = k - 1;
    let j = workers.length - 1;
    let personalCap = Array.from({length: k}, (_, idx) => workers[workers.length - 1 - idx]);

    for(i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if(tasks[i] <= workers[j]) {
            j--;
            continue;
        }
        if (strength < tasks[i] - workers[j] || tasks[i] > workers[j] + p) {
            return false;
        }
        strength -= tasks[i] - workers[j];
        j--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Example usage
let tasks = [3, 2, 1];
let workers = [0, 3, 3];
let p = 1;
let strength = 4;
console.log(maxTasksAssignable(tasks, workers, p, strength)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the `tasks` and `workers` arrays takes `O(n log n + m log m)`.
- **Binary search** operates in `O(log(min(n, m)))`.
- **Each check in `canAssign` function** potentially involves going through up to `O(min(n, m))` elements.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n + m log m + (min(n, m) * log(min(n, m))))`.

This solution should efficiently find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to workers under the given constraints.
