### Problem Statement
1925. Count Square Sum Triples

Given a number `n`, return the number of triplets (a, b, c) such that `1 <= a, b, c <= n` and `a^2 + b^2 == c^2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range and Constraints of n:** What is the value range for `n`? Can it be zero or negative?
   - Answer: As per typical constraints, `n` will be a positive integer.
   
2. **Unordered Triples:** Are triplets like (3, 4, 5) and (4, 3, 5) considered distinct, i.e., should order be considered?
   - Answer: Typically, in such problems, order doesn't matter for (a, b), but we will count each combination separately as the problem statement doesn't specify the need to consider (a, b) and (b, a) as same for counting purposes.

### Strategy
1. **Triple Loop:** Utilize three nested loops to iterate through all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the range 1 to `n`.
2. **Pythagorean Theorem Check:** For each triplet (a, b, c), check if `a^2 + b^2 == c^2`.
3. **Counting Valid Triples:** Maintain a counter for valid triples satisfying the above condition.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation based on the above strategy:

```javascript
function countTriplets(n) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
        for (let b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
            for (let c = 1; c <= n; c++) {
                if (a * a + b * b === c * c) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(countTriplets(10)); // Output should be the count of valid triples
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The nested loops make the time complexity O(n^3) as we are iterating through all combinations of a, b, and c.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

### Optimization
While the current solution has a cubic time complexity, for larger values of `n`, this approach might not be efficient. Optimizations might involve reducing the search space or employing more advanced mathematical properties to avoid unnecessary checks.
