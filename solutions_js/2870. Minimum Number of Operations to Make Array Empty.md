[Leetcode 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2870)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You have to perform the following operation until the array is empty:

1. Select any subsequence of the array such that every element of the selected subsequence is equal.
2. Remove this subsequence from the array.

The goal is to minimize the number of operations needed to empty the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the input size?**
   - The problem typically will provide size constraints like 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5.
2. **Can we assume the array contains only positive integers?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, the array will consist of only positive integers.
3. **Do the elements have any specific range?**
   - Usually, elements will range from 1 to the largest integer values handled by the language.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - First, count the frequency of each unique number in the array using a hash map.
   
2. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The minimum number of operations to remove all instances of each unique number is the ceiling of its frequency divided by the allowed capacity (which is how many same items can be removed in one operation, often assumed as fixed in some problems. Here, assume we can remove any number of same items in one operation).

3. **Summing Up**:
   - Sum up the minimum operations required for each unique number.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(nums) {
    let frequencyMap = new Map();

    // Count frequencies of each number
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (!frequencyMap.has(num)) {
            frequencyMap.set(num, 0);
        }
        frequencyMap.set(num, frequencyMap.get(num) + 1);
    }

    // Calculate the minimum number of operations
    let operations = 0;
    for (let [num, count] of frequencyMap) {
        operations += count; // each distinct number implies one operation per their count.
    }

    return operations;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minOperations([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves iterating through `nums` once to build the frequency map (O(n)), and then iterating through the map's entries, which in the worst case is O(n) as well, if all values in the array are unique.
  - **Overall**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is primarily from storing frequency counts in a hash map, which in the worst case can be O(n) if all elements are unique.
  - **Overall**: O(n)

This solution ensures that we efficiently count and calculate the minimum operations to empty the array.
