[Leetcode 1366. Rank Teams by Votes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1366)
## Problem Statement

In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by the total score i.e., based on the positions they have gotten from the voters. The scores are calculated as:
- 1st position: n points
- 2nd position: n-1 points
- 3rd position: n-2 points
- ...
- (n-1)th position: 2 points
- n-th position: 1 point

For example, if there are 3 teams, and a voter gives ranks as ["ABC"], then:
- Team A would have 3 points
- Team B would have 2 points
- Team C would have 1 point

We are supposed to aggregate all voter's rankings and determine the final ranking of all teams. If two teams have the same score, the lexicographical order of their names is used as the tie-breaker.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will there ever be scenarios where no votes are cast?**
   - For this problem, assume there will always be at least one vote cast.

2. **Are team names unique and consist of capital letters only?**
   - Yes, each team is represented by a unique uppercase letter.

3. **Can there be more than one voter, and do all votes need to cover all the teams?**
   - Yes, multiple voters exist, and each voter's ranking covers all teams.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use a dictionary to track scores for each team where keys are team names and values are lists of scores for each position.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each vote, update the dictionary with the scores for the teams according to their positions.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the teams primarily by their scores (in descending order), and in cases of ties, sort lexicographically by team names.

## Code

```javascript
function rankTeams(votes) {
    const teamScores = {};
    const numTeams = votes[0].length;

    // Initialize the score table
    for (let team of votes[0]) {
        teamScores[team] = new Array(numTeams).fill(0);
    }

    // Fill the score table
    for (let vote of votes) {
        for (let i = 0; i < vote.length; i++) {
            teamScores[vote[i]][i]++;
        }
    }

    // Sort the teams
    const sortedTeams = Object.keys(teamScores).sort((a, b) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < numTeams; i++) {
            if (teamScores[a][i] !== teamScores[b][i]) {
                return teamScores[b][i] - teamScores[a][i];
            }
        }
        // Tie-breaking by lexicographical order
        return a.localeCompare(b);
    });

    return sortedTeams.join('');
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n) where `n` is the number of teams (to set up the initial scores).
- **Score Calculation**: O(v * n) where `v` is the number of votes and `n` is the number of teams (each vote needs to be processed).
- **Sorting**: O(n log n) for sorting the teams.

So the overall time complexity of our solution will be **O(v * n + n log n)**, which is efficient given the constraints.
