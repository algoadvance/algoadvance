[Leetcode 210. Course Schedule II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l210)
## Problem Statement

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you must take course `b_i` before course `a_i`.

* Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
* If there are many valid answers, return any of them.
* If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

### Example 1:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0.
So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2.
Both course 1 and course 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
- All the pairs `[a_i, b_i]` are distinct.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can courses have no prerequisites?
   **A**: Yes, in such cases the course can be taken at any time.

2. **Q**: Are there any duplicate entries in the prerequisites array?
   **A**: No, all pairs `[a_i, b_i]` are distinct.

3. **Q**: Is it guaranteed that there is at least one valid topological order of courses?
   **A**: No, if it's impossible to finish all courses (e.g., due to a cycle), our function should return an empty array.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a topological sort algorithm, which is suitable for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The approach involves:

1. **Building the Graph**: Representing courses and their prerequisites as a graph.
2. **Calculating In-degrees**: Counting the number of prerequisites each course has.
3. **Using a Queue for Zero In-degree Nodes**: Starting with nodes that have no prerequisites and gradually removing them from the graph.
4. **Detecting Cycles**: If we can't remove all nodes, a cycle exists, making it impossible to finish all courses.

### Steps:

1. Create an adjacency list for the graph representation.
2. Create an in-degree array to count the number of prerequisites for each course.
3. Initialize the queue with all courses having zero in-degree (no prerequisites).
4. Process each course, adding it to the result and reducing the in-degree of its dependent courses.
5. If at the end all courses are in the result, return the result. Otherwise, return an empty array indicating a cycle.

## Code

```javascript
function findOrder(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    const graph = Array.from({ length: numCourses }, () => []);
    const inDegree = new Array(numCourses).fill(0);
    const order = [];
    
    // Build the graph and in-degree array
    for (const [course, prereq] of prerequisites) {
        graph[prereq].push(course);
        inDegree[course]++;
    }
    
    // Queue for courses that have no prerequisites
    const queue = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift();
        order.push(current);
        
        for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) {
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return order.length === numCourses ? order : [];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building Graph**: O(P) where P is the number of prerequisite pairs.
- **Queue Initialization**: O(C) where C is the number of courses.
- **Processing Queue**: O(C + P) where C is the number of courses and P is the number of prerequisite pairs.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(C + P)**, which is efficient for the given constraints.
