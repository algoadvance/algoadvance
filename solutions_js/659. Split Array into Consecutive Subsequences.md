[Leetcode 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l659)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order. You need to determine if it is possible to split `nums` into one or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has a length of at least 3.

Return `true` if possible, otherwise, return `false`.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: You can split them into two consecutive subsequences: [1,2,3,3,4,5] => [1,2,3] and [3,4,5].

Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: You can split them into two consecutive subsequences: [1,2,3,4,5] and [3,4,5].

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot split them into consecutive subsequences of length 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the subsequences overlap? 
   - Yes, subsequences can overlap as shown in the examples.
2. Is there any constraint on the length of `nums`?
   - `nums.length` will be at most \(10^4\).
3. Are negative numbers or duplicates allowed in the input?
   - The input `nums` contains only positive integers and is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy:

We will use a greedy approach to solve the problem. The goal is to ensure every number in the array is part of at least one valid subsequence of consecutive numbers.

### Steps:
1. We will use two hash maps:
   - `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `nums`.
   - `appendFreq` to keep track of the frequency of numbers that can be appended to existing subsequences.

2. We iterate over the `nums` array. For each number `num`, we check:
   - If `freq[num] > 0`, it means `num` is still available.
   - Check if `num` can be appended to an existing subsequence (`appendFreq[num] > 0`). If `yes`, append it.
   - Otherwise, try to create a new subsequence starting with `num` by ensuring `num+1` and `num+2` are available. If not, return `false`.

3. If we can iterate through all the numbers following these checks, return `true`.

## Code:
```javascript
function isPossible(nums) {
    const freq = {};
    const appendFreq = {};

    // Create frequency map of nums
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (freq[num] == null) freq[num] = 0;
        freq[num]++;
    }

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (freq[num] === 0) continue; // Skip if the number is already used

        // If there's a subsequence ending with 'num-1', we can append 'num' to it
        if (appendFreq[num] > 0) {
            appendFreq[num]--;
            if (appendFreq[num+1] == null) appendFreq[num+1] = 0;
            appendFreq[num+1]++;
        } 
        // Create a new subsequence num, num+1, num+2
        else if (freq[num+1] > 0 && freq[num+2] > 0) {
            freq[num+1]--;
            freq[num+2]--;
            if (appendFreq[num+3] == null) appendFreq[num+3] = 0;
            appendFreq[num+3]++;
        } 
        else {
            return false;
        }

        freq[num]--;
    }

    return true;
}

// Test the function with an example input
console.log(isPossible([1,2,3,3,4,5])); // Output: true
console.log(isPossible([1,2,3,4,4,5])); // Output: false
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list a constant number of times and dictionary operations (insert and access) are on average \(O(1)\). The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional storage used for the `freq` and `appendFreq` hash maps.
