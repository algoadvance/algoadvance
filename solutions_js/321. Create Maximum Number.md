[Leetcode 321. Create Maximum Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l321)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2` and an integer `k`, return an array of the **maximum number of length `k`** that can be formed from `nums1` and `nums2` by selecting elements from each array in a way that **maintains the relative order of the elements** from each array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements from `nums1` and `nums2` be mixed?**
   - Yes, elements can be picked from both arrays, but their relative order from the respective array should be maintained.

2. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `nums1`, `nums2`, and `k`?**
   - The lengths of the arrays are in the range `[1, 1000]` and `k` will be between `1` and `min(nums1.length + nums2.length, 2000)`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the elements within `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Elements are integers and can range from `0` to `9`.

### Strategy

1. **Helper Function to Get Max Sequence:**
   - Create a function to extract the maximum subsequence of length `k` from a single array while maintaining the original order.

2. **Merge Function:**
   - Merge two subsequences to form the maximum possible number while maintaining the relative order of elements from both arrays.

3. **Iterate and Combine:**
   - For each possible split between `nums1` and `nums2` (from `0` to `k`), derive the maximum subsequence and merge them to get the largest possible combination. Track the maximum combination out of all possible splits.

### Code

```javascript
function maxNumber(nums1, nums2, k) {
    function maxSubsequence(nums, k) {
        const stack = [];
        const drop = nums.length - k;
        let remain = drop;

        for (let num of nums) {
            while (stack.length && num > stack[stack.length - 1] && remain) {
                stack.pop();
                remain--;
            }
            stack.push(num);
        }
        
        return stack.slice(0, k);
    }

    function merge(subseq1, subseq2) {
        const merged = [];
        while (subseq1.length || subseq2.length) {
            if (greater(subseq1, subseq2)) {
                merged.push(subseq1.shift());
            } else {
                merged.push(subseq2.shift());
            }
        }
        return merged;
    }

    function greater(subseq1, subseq2) {
        let i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < subseq1.length && j < subseq2.length) {
            if (subseq1[i] > subseq2[j]) return true;
            if (subseq1[i] < subseq2[j]) return false;
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        return subseq1.length > subseq2.length;
    }

    let best = [];
    for (let i = Math.max(0, k - nums2.length); i <= Math.min(k, nums1.length); i++) {
        const subsequence1 = maxSubsequence(nums1, i);
        const subsequence2 = maxSubsequence(nums2, k - i);
        const candidate = merge(subsequence1, subsequence2);
        if (greater(candidate, best)) {
            best = candidate;
        }
    }
    return best;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **maxSubsequence Function:**
   - The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the array because each element is processed at most once.

2. **merge Function:**
   - The time complexity is O(k) for each merge since each element from both subsequences is processed once.

3. **Overall:**
   - The overall complexity is O(k^2 * (n + m)):
     - O(k) iterations (from 0 to k)
     - For each iteration, maxSubsequence is called twice: O(n + m)
     - The merge for each candidate: O(k)
   
Here, n and m are the lengths of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
