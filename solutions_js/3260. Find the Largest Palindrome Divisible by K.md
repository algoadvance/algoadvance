[Leetcode 3260. Find the Largest Palindrome Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3260)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a positive integer `k`. Your task is to find the largest palindrome number that is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the range of possible values for `k`?**
   - This will help in determining if the approach needs optimization for very large values.

2. **Is there a maximum number of digits for the palindrome?**
   - Knowing this helps set an upper limit for the search space.

3. **Should the solution handle edge cases like very small `k` (e.g., `k=1`)?**
   - This clarifies if there's a need to consider trivial solutions.

4. **Are there any constraints on execution time or space?**
   - This will guide if advanced optimizations are necessary.

### Code:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(num) {
    const str = num.toString();
    const reversedStr = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    return str === reversedStr;
}

function findLargestPalindromeDivisibleByK(k) {
    let upperLimit = 999999999; // Assuming we are looking at 9-digit numbers as an example; this can be adjusted
    let largestPalindrome = -1;

    for (let i = upperLimit; i >= k; i--) {
        if (isPalindrome(i) && i % k === 0) {
            largestPalindrome = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    return largestPalindrome;
}

// Example
console.log(findLargestPalindromeDivisibleByK(7)); // Should print the output of the largest palindrome divisible by 7
```

### Strategy:

1. **Define a function `isPalindrome`:**
   - This function takes a number, converts it to a string, and checks if it reads the same backward as forward.

2. **Iterate from a high limit downwards:**
   - Start from the largest possible number (in this case, we assume a 9-digit number). Adjust this based on the requirements.
   - For each number, check if it is a palindrome and if it is divisible by `k`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, return the number immediately as we are moving from the largest possible number downward.
   
3. **Output the result:**

### Time Complexity:

- The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(N/k) where N is the chosen upper limit for palindrome numbers.
  - The loop runs from the upper limit down to `k`, but we only check every `k-th` number on average.
  - The palindrome check itself is O(d) where d is the number of digits in the number (`log10(N)`).

This approach ensures that we optimize by breaking early once the condition is met and balances the need for accuracy and efficiency. Adjustments might be needed based on specific problem constraints or input details.
