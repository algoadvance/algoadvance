[Leetcode 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2807)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list `head` and an integer array `gcdValues`. The list is sorted in target order, which corresponds to the indices of `gcdValues`. For each pair of adjacent nodes in the list, you must insert a new node with the value set to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two adjacent nodes.

This process needs to be repeated for each pair of adjacent nodes in the list. You should return the head of the modified linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

- What is the length range for the linked list?
- What is the range of values in the linked list nodes?
- Are there any constraints on the gcdValues array?

### Assumptions

- The length of the linked list and the `gcdValues` array is at least 2.
- The node values and gcdValues can be handled by the built-in JavaScript `Number` type.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through the Linked List**:
    - Traverse the linked list to get pairs of adjacent nodes.
    - Compute the GCD for each pair.

2. **Insert GCD Nodes**:
    - Create new nodes containing the corresponding GCD value.
    - Insert each new GCD node between the respective adjacent nodes.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list node.
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

// Helper function to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
function gcd(a, b) {
    if (!b) {
        return a;
    }
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
function insertGCDs(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }

    let current = head;

    while (current && current.next) {
        let nextNode = current.next;
        let gcdValue = gcd(current.val, nextNode.val);

        // Create a new node with the GCD value and insert it between current and nextNode
        let gcdNode = new ListNode(gcdValue);
        gcdNode.next = nextNode;
        current.next = gcdNode;

        // Move to the next pair
        current = nextNode;
    }

    return head;
}
```

### Example Execution

Let's consider an example:

- Suppose the linked list is `2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 9`.
- The GCD of `(2, 3)` is `1`.
- The GCD of `(3, 6)` is `3`.
- The GCD of `(6, 9)` is `3`.

So the modified linked list should look like: `2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3 -> 9`.

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal of the list**: \( O(n) \) since we visit each node once.
- **GCD Calculation**: \( O(\log(\min(a, b))) \) for each pair of nodes.
- **Insertion**: constant time for each insertion.

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n \log k) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list and \( k \) is the average value of the nodes.
