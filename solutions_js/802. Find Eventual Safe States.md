[Leetcode 802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l802)
## Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a list called `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes that node `i` directs to (i.e., `graph[i]` is a list of nodes `j` for which there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `j`).

A node is a terminal node if it has no outgoing edges. A node is eventually safe if every sequence of moves starting from that node leads to a terminal node.

Return an array containing all the nodes that are eventually safe. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes an eventual safe state?**
   - A node is eventually safe if every sequence of moves starting from it leads to a terminal node.

2. **What is a terminal node?**
   - A terminal node is a node with no outgoing edges.

3. **Is the input always valid?**
   - Yes, it’s guaranteed to be a valid directed graph with all nodes numbered from 0 to n-1.

4. **What should be the output format?**
   - An array of nodes sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Terminal Nodes**: Start with nodes that have no outgoing edges; these are terminal nodes.
2. **Reverse the Graph**: Create a reverse of the given graph to allow easier traversal from terminal nodes to their predecessors.
3. **Use Topological Sorting (Kahn’s Algorithm)**: Use a modified form of topological sorting to identify all nodes that eventually lead to terminal nodes.
4. **Construct the Result**: Traverse from terminal nodes using the reverse graph to identify all eventually safe nodes.

## Code

```javascript
var eventualSafeNodes = function(graph) {
    const n = graph.length;

    // Create reverse graph
    const reverseGraph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const outDegrees = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let src = 0; src < n; src++) {
        for (const dest of graph[src]) {
            reverseGraph[dest].push(src);
        }
        outDegrees[src] = graph[src].length;
    }

    const queue = [];
    // Add all terminal nodes (nodes with out-degree 0) to the queue
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (outDegrees[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    const safeNodes = new Array(n).fill(false);

    // Process nodes in the queue
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const node = queue.shift();
        safeNodes[node] = true;
        for (const prevNode of reverseGraph[node]) {
            outDegrees[prevNode]--;
            if (outDegrees[prevNode] === 0) {
                queue.push(prevNode);
            }
        }
    }

    // Collect all safe nodes
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (safeNodes[i]) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage
const graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]];
console.log(eventualSafeNodes(graph)); // Output: [2, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Traversal**: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
- **Reverse Graph Construction**: O(V + E), with V being the number of vertices.
- **Queue Processing**: O(V + E) as each node and edge is processed once.

Overall, the time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

This strategy ensures all eventually safe nodes are identified efficiently and the result is sorted in ascending order.
