[Leetcode 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1675)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, you must alter the array such that the deviation of the array is minimized. The deviation of the array is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

You can perform two operations on each element of the array any number of times:
- If the element is even, you can divide it by 2 (you can do this as many times as you like, until the element becomes odd).
- If the element is odd, you can multiply it by 2 (you can do this exactly once before it becomes even).

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    - Output: 1
    - Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2]. The deviation is 3 - 2 = 1.
  
- Example 2:
    - Input: nums = [4,1,5,20,3]
    - Output: 3
    - Explanation: You can transform the array to [4,2,5,5,3]. The deviation is 5 - 2 = 3.
  
- Example 3:
    - Input: nums = [2,10,8]
    - Output: 3


### Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **If the number is even, should it always be divided continuously until it becomes odd, or can it be stopped at any point?**
   - When the element is even, you can continue to divide by 2 as desired. However, the strategy to minimize deviation will guide this process.

2. **When the number is odd, should it always be multiplied exactly once, or can it be multiplied multiple times?**
   - If the element is odd, it can be multiplied exactly once to turn it to even.

3. **Are the values in `nums` unique?**
   - The problem does not specify uniqueness, thus the values in `nums` can be repeated.

## Strategy for Solution

1. **Initial Transformations**: 
   - Convert all odd numbers by multiplying them by 2 so that they become even. This is because for minimizing deviation, having the potential to lower values by making use of division is crucial.
   
2. **Use a Max-Heap**:
   - Maintain a max-heap of the array values to continuously access and modify the highest value.

3. **Minimize Deviation**:
   - Track the minimum value in the array while modifying the maximum values.
   - Repeatedly extract the maximum value, calculate the current deviation, and then divide the maximum by 2 if it's even. Push the resulting new value back into the heap.
   - Stop when the maximum value is odd as it cannot be further divided.

4. **Heap Operations**:
   - During each extraction of the max element from the heap, track the minimum value and update the result for the deviation accordingly.

### Time Complexity
- The initial population of the heap takes `O(n log n)`.
- Each operation of extraction and insertion in a heap is `O(log n)`.
- In the worst case, for `n` elements, the number of operations might need to scale with the magnitude of the numbers, indicating a complexity somewhat around `O(n log M log n)` where `M` is the value of the maximum number in `nums`.

## Code

```javascript
class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    push(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }

    pop() {
        const max = this.heap[0];
        const end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this.sinkDown(0);
        }
        return max;
    }

    peek() {
        return this.heap[0];
    }

    bubbleUp(index) {
        const element = this.heap[index];
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            let parent = this.heap[parentIndex];
            if (element <= parent) break;
            this.heap[parentIndex] = element;
            this.heap[index] = parent;
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }

    sinkDown(index) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[index];
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIdx = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIdx = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIdx];
                if (leftChild > element) {
                    swap = leftChildIdx;
                }
            }

            if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIdx];
                if ((swap === null && rightChild > element) || (swap !== null && rightChild > leftChild)) {
                    swap = rightChildIdx;
                }
            }

            if (swap === null) break;
            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }
}

var minimumDeviation = function(nums) {
    const heap = new MaxHeap();
    let min = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    
    // Prepare the heap: Convert all odd numbers to even by multiplying by 2
    // Track the minimum element
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num % 2 === 1) num *= 2;
        heap.push(num);
        min = Math.min(min, num);
    }
    
    let minDeviation = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    
    // Process the heap
    while (heap.peek() % 2 === 0) {
        let max = heap.pop();
        minDeviation = Math.min(minDeviation, max - min);
        max /= 2;
        heap.push(max);
        min = Math.min(min, max);
    }
    
    // Final tweak in deviation after the loop ends
    minDeviation = Math.min(minDeviation, heap.peek() - min);
    
    return minDeviation;
};
```
