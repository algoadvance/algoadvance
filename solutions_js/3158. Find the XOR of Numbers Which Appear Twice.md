[Leetcode 3158. Find the XOR of Numbers Which Appear Twice](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3158)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `nums` which may contain integers appearing exactly twice and one integer which appears only once. Find the integer that appears only once.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is the input array non-empty?
    - What are the minimum and maximum lengths of the array?
    - Can the array contain negative numbers or is it limited to positive integers?

2. **Output Expectations:**
    - Should the function return an integer which is the unique number?

### Code:

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem using XOR:

```javascript
function findUnique(nums) {
    let unique = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        unique ^= num;
    }
    return unique;
}
```

### Strategy:

The problem can efficiently be solved using the XOR bitwise operation. XOR has some interesting properties that are useful for this problem:
1. `a ^ a = 0` (Any number XORed with itself results in 0).
2. `a ^ 0 = a` (Any number XORed with 0 is the number itself).

Given these properties, if we XOR all numbers in the array, all numbers that appear twice will cancel out each other because `num ^ num = 0`. Therefore, the result will be the number that appears only once.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm goes through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we are using only a single variable for computation regardless of the input size.

This approach is efficient and meets the problem requirements optimally.
