[Leetcode 2295. Replace Elements in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2295)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace any element of the array with any other element.

- You need to replace all occurrences of an element `x` in the array with another element `y`.
- You also need to return the modified array.

Implement the function `replaceElements(nums, operations)` where:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `operations` is a list of tuples `(x, y)` where each tuple represents an operation to replace all occurrences of `x` with `y` in `nums`.

### Example

```javascript
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6], operations = [[1,3],[4,7],[6,1]]
Output: [3,2,7,1]

Input: nums = [1,2], operations = [[1,3],[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [2,1]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the range of integers in the `nums` array and `operations` array?**
   - Assume that values are within the range of typical signed integer limits.

2. **Can the `nums` array be empty?**
   - Yes, handle it gracefully by returning an empty array if `nums` is empty.

3. **Should we consider the order of operations to be important?**
   - Yes, perform the operations in the provided order.

## Strategy

We will use a hashmap to optimize the replacements:
1. First, build a mapping to track the final transformation of each number.
2. Iterate through the `operations` array and update our map with the final replacement values.
3. Make a pass through the `nums` array and use our transformation map to get the latest value for each number.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a hashmap (let's call it `replaceMap`) to keep track of the replacements.
2. Iterate over the `operations` array to populate the `replaceMap`.
3. Traverse the `nums` array and replace the elements based on the values in `replaceMap`.

## Code

```javascript
function replaceElements(nums, operations) {
    let replaceMap = new Map();
    
    // Build the transformation map from operations
    for (let [x, y] of operations) {
        let original = x;
        // Find the ultimate replacement for x
        if (replaceMap.has(x)) {
            original = replaceMap.get(x);
        }
        replaceMap.set(original, y);
        // Ensure that intermediate transformations are also tracked
        replaceMap.set(x, y);
    }
    
    // Apply the transformations to the nums array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (replaceMap.has(nums[i])) {
            nums[i] = replaceMap.get(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    
    return nums;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the replaceMap**:
   - Each operation in `operations` array updates the map, taking O(1) time per operation.
   - Thus, if there are `m` operations, it takes O(m) time.

2. **Transforming the `nums` array**:
   - Each element lookup and transformation takes O(1) per element.
   - Thus, for `n` elements in `nums`, it takes O(n) time.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array and `m` is the number of operations.
