[Leetcode 7. Reverse Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l7)
## Problem Statement

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: x = 0
Output: 0
```

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should leading zeros in the reversed integer be removed (i.e., `120` becomes `21`)?
   **A:** Yes, the leading zeros should be removed in the reversed integer.

2. **Q:** How should the function behave if the reversed integer overflows the 32-bit signed integer range?
   **A:** The function should return 0 in that case.

## Strategy

1. **Handle the Sign:** Determine the sign of the integer and work with its absolute value.
2. **Reverse the Digits:** Convert the integer to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back to an integer.
3. **Check for Overflow:** Ensure the reversed integer is within the 32-bit signed integer range.
4. **Return Result:** Return the reversed integer with the correct sign. If it overflows, return 0.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer. The primary operations (converting to string, reversing the string, and converting back to an integer) all operate in linear time relative to the number of digits.

## Code

```javascript
var reverse = function(x) {
    const MAX_INT = 2**31 - 1;
    const MIN_INT = -(2**31);

    let sign = x < 0 ? -1 : 1;
    let absX = Math.abs(x);

    let reversedStr = absX.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
    let reversedNum = parseInt(reversedStr) * sign;

    if (reversedNum > MAX_INT || reversedNum < MIN_INT) {
        return 0;
    }
    return reversedNum;
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Constants:** `MAX_INT` and `MIN_INT` define the bounds for 32-bit signed integers.
2. **Sign Handling:** Determine the sign of `x` and store it in `sign`. Work with the absolute value of `x`.
3. **Reversing the Digits:** Convert the absolute value to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back to an integer. Apply the previously determined sign.
4. **Overflow Check:** If the reversed number exceeds the 32-bit signed integer limits, return 0.
5. **Return Result:** If no overflow, return the reversed integer with the appropriate sign.

This approach ensures that all edge cases, including overflow and negative numbers, are properly handled.
