[Leetcode 796. Rotate String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l796)
### Problem Statement

This problem is from LeetCode: 796. Rotate String

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

A shift on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position. For example, if `s = 'abcde'`, then it will be `bcdea` after one shift.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What will be the maximum length of the strings `s` and `goal`?
   - Are the two strings guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `s` and `goal` are already the same?
   - What if one or both strings are empty?

3. **Expected Output**:
   - Should the function return a boolean value indicating if `s` can transform into `goal`?

Assuming standard constraints for LeetCode problems and no specific constraints mentioned.

### Strategy

To determine if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts, we can use the following strategy:

1. **String Length Check**: If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are not the same, `s` cannot be rotated to become `goal`.

2. **Concatenation Trick**: By concatenating `s` with itself (i.e., `s + s`), any possible rotation of `s` will be a substring of this new string. For example, if `s = 'abcde'`, then `s + s = 'abcdeabcde'`. Any rotation of `s` will appear as a substring of `'abcdeabcde'`.

3. **Substring Check**: If `goal` is a substring of `s + s`, then `s` can be rotated to become `goal`.

Let's proceed with the code.

### Code

```javascript
function rotateString(s, goal) {
    // Length check
    if (s.length !== goal.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if goal is a substring of s + s
    let doubledString = s + s;
    return doubledString.includes(goal);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **String Concatenation**: The concatenation operation `s + s` takes O(n) time where `n` is the length of `s`.
- **Substring Check**: The `includes` method on a string of length `2n` checking for a substring of length `n` has a worst-case time complexity of O(n).

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**.
