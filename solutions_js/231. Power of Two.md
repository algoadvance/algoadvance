[Leetcode 231. Power of Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l231)
## Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

An integer `n` is a power of two if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 2^x`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1 
Output: true
Explanation: 2^0 = 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 16 
Output: true
Explanation: 2^4 = 16
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3 
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 4 
Output: true
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 5 
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the function consider negative numbers?
   - No, negative numbers cannot be powers of two, they should immediately return false.
2. What should the function return for 0?
   - 0 is not a power of two, so the function should return false for `n = 0`.

## Strategy:
1. First, check if `n` is less than or equal to zero. If it is, return false because powers of two are positive.
2. Use a bit manipulation trick to determine if `n` is a power of two:
   - A number `n` is a power of two if in its binary form, it has exactly one `1` bit and all other bits are `0`.
   - This property can be checked using the expression `n & (n - 1) == 0`, which is only true for powers of two. This works because `n - 1` flips all the bits after the rightmost `1` bit of `n`.

## Code:
Here is the JavaScript function to check if a given number `n` is a power of two.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPowerOfTwo = function(n) {
    // Return false for non-positive numbers
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check the power of two condition using bitwise AND operation
    return (n & (n - 1)) === 0;
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- The function runs in O(1) time since the bitwise operations involve a fixed number of steps.
- The space complexity is also O(1) because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

This solution is efficient and leverages the properties of binary numbers to determine if an integer is a power of two effectively.
