[Leetcode 388. Longest Absolute File Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l388)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string representation of a filesystem. The input string is formatted in the following manner: 
- The string consists of directory names and filenames, separated by newline characters (`'\n'`).
- Each directory or file name has an indentation level represented by one or more tab characters (`'\t'`).
- Each `'\t'` counts as a single level of depth in the filesystem. 

A file is identified by the presence of a dot (`'.'`) in its name (e.g., `'file.txt'`). Your task is to find the length of the longest absolute path to a file within the filesystem. If there is no file in the input string, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the solution handle invalid input formats?
   - For example, if there are mismatched indentation levels or missing newline characters?
   - **Assume the input is always valid as per the problem statement description.**

2. Should we consider edge cases like an empty string or no files present?
   - **Yes, if no files are present, return 0. If the input string is empty, also return 0.**

### Strategy

1. Split the input string by newline characters to process each line individually.
2. Use a stack or an array to keep track of the current path lengths at different directory levels.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum path length found.
4. Iterate over each line:
   - Determine the depth of the current directory/file based on the number of `'\t'` characters.
   - Calculate the path length for the current directory/file and update the stack/array.
   - If the current line represents a file, update the maximum path length if this path is longer than previously found paths.
5. Finally, return the maximum path length. 

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} input
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthLongestPath = function(input) {
    // Split the input by new lines to process the filesystem structure
    const lines = input.split('\n');
    
    // Stack to keep track of the length of directories at various depths
    const stack = [];
    
    // To keep track of the maximum length of a valid file path found
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each line
    for (const line of lines) {
        // Find the depth of the current file/directory
        const depth = line.lastIndexOf('\t') + 1;
        
        # Remove leading tabs
        const name = line.substring(depth);
        
        // Calculate current length
        const currentLength = (depth > 0 ? stack[depth - 1] : 0) + name.length + 1;
        
        if (name.includes('.')) {
            // It's a file, update the max length if this is the longest found
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength - 1);
        } else {
            // It's a directory, push the current length to the stack
            stack[depth] = currentLength;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input string. This is because we are splitting the input string into lines and processing each line a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) in the worst-case scenario, where all lines are nested inside each other leading to a maximum depth stack.

This solution efficiently computes the longest absolute file path within the provided filesystem representation.
