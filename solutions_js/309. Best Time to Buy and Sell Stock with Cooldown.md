[Leetcode 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l309)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

1. After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

### Example:
```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we have multiple transactions on the same day?
   - No, you can either buy or sell on a given day, not both.
2. Can prices be zero?
   - No, the prices will be positive integers.
3. What should be the output if there are no prices or just one day of prices?
   - If there are no prices, the profit is 0. If there's only one day, you cannot make any transactions, so the profit is also 0.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will maintain three states:
     - `dp[i][0]` - maximum profit on the `i-th` day if we do nothing or are just cooling down.
     - `dp[i][1]` - maximum profit on the `i-th` day if we are holding a stock.
     - `dp[i][2]` - maximum profit on the `i-th` day if we just sold a stock.
   - On the `i-th` day:
     - If we are holding a stock, it must mean we either continued holding from the previous day or bought the stock today after a cooldown.
     - If we are in a 'cooldown' state, it means we were either in a cooldown state the previous day or we just sold the stock today.
     - If we just sold a stock today, it means we were holding a stock until today.
   - Transition formulas:
     - `dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2])`
     - `dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - prices[i])`
     - `dp[i][2] = dp[i-1][1] + prices[i]`

## Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    if(prices.length <= 1) return 0;

    const n = prices.length;
    // Initialize dp arrays
    let dp0 = 0; // First day: doing nothing
    let dp1 = -prices[0]; // First day: bought a stock
    let dp2 = 0; // First day: just sold a stock (impossible)

    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let newDp0 = Math.max(dp0, dp2);
        let newDp1 = Math.max(dp1, dp0 - prices[i]);
        let newDp2 = dp1 + prices[i];

        dp0 = newDp0;
        dp1 = newDp1;
        dp2 = newDp2;
    }

    return Math.max(dp0, dp2);
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the prices array. This is because we are iterating through the prices array once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using only a constant amount of extra space to store our states (`dp0`, `dp1`, and `dp2`).
