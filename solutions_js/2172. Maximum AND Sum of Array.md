[Leetcode 2172. Maximum AND Sum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2172)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `numSlots` representing the number of slots. The slots are numbered `1` to `numSlots`, and you need to place all `n` integers into these slots such that the bitwise AND sum of the values of the slots is maximized. Each slot can hold up to two integers, and you must place exactly one or two integers into each slot. Return the maximum possible bitwise AND sum that can be obtained.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values**: What are the expected ranges for `n` (number of integers in the array) and `numSlots` (number of slots)?
2. **Array Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values within the `nums` array?
3. **Behavior with Different Slot Counts**: How does the function behave if `numSlots >= n/2` (i.e., more slots are available than required)?

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} numSlots
 * @return {number}
 */
function maximumANDSum(nums, numSlots) {
    const dp = Array(1 << (numSlots * 2)).fill(-1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    const getTotalBits = (mask) => {
        let bits = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < numSlots * 2; i++) {
            if (mask & (1 << i)) bits++;
        }
        return bits;
    }
    
    const getANDSum = (mask) => {
        let sum = 0;
        let slots = new Array(numSlots).fill(0);
        let p = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < numSlots; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                if (mask & (1 << p)) {
                    slots[i] += nums[getTotalBits(mask & ((1 << p) - 1))];
                }
                p++;
            }
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < numSlots; i++) {
            sum += slots[i] & i+1;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    for (let mask = 0; mask < (1 << (numSlots * 2)); mask++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < numSlots * 2; i++) {
            if (!(mask & (1 << i))) {
                let newMask = mask | (1 << i);
                dp[newMask] = Math.max(dp[newMask], dp[mask] + getANDSum(newMask) - getANDSum(mask));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[(1 << (numSlots * 2)) - 1];
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
let numSlots = 3;
console.log(maximumANDSum(nums, numSlots)); // Output should be determined by function logic
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP approach where the state `dp[mask]` represents the maximum AND sum achievable with the configuration represented by `mask`.
2. **Bitmask Representation**: Use bitmasking to denote the number of elements placed in slots. Each slot can hold up to two elements, so a `mask` of size `numSlots * 2` is sufficient.
3. **Slot Filling**: Iterate over all possible states (`mask`) to compute maximum AND sum, ensuring each slot can hold exactly one or two integers.
4. **DP Updates**: For each mask, try to place an element in an empty position and update the DP table accordingly.

### Time Complexity

- The complexity primarily arises from iterating over all possible `2^(numSlots*2)` masks and updating the DP table.
- The overall time complexity is `O(2^(numSlots * 2) * numSlots * 2)`, which simplifies to `O(numSlots * 2^(numSlots * 2 + 1))`.

It is crucial to optimize and fine-tune for very large `numSlots` due to the exponential growth of `2^(numSlots*2)`.
