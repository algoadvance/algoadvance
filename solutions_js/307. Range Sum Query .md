[Leetcode 307. Range Sum Query ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l307)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and you have to implement two interfaces of a class:

1. `update(index, val)`: Updates the value of `nums[index]` to be `val`.
2. `sumRange(left, right)`: Returns the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive (i.e., `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

Example:
```javascript
let nums = [1, 3, 5];
NumArray numArray = new NumArray(nums);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 9 (1 + 3 + 5)
numArray.update(1, 2); // nums = [1, 2, 5]
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 8 (1 + 2 + 5)
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the initial array have negative numbers?**
    - Yes, the array can contain any integer values.
    
2. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
    - Typically the size can be up to 10^4.

3. **How frequently will the `update` and `sumRange` operations be called?**
    - These operations may be called many times, so efficiency is important.
   
### Strategy

To efficiently handle both the `update` and `sumRange` operations, using a Segment Tree or a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) is optimal. These data structures allow for update and range query in logarithmic time.

We'll use a Segment Tree in this scenario as it provides a clean and understandable approach for both operations:

1. **Segment Tree Initialization:**
    - Construct the tree based on the array `nums` where each leaf node represents an element from the array.
    - Internal nodes of the tree will store the sum of their respective segments.

2. **Update Operation:**
    - Update a specific leaf node and propagate the change up the tree to adjust the sums accordingly.

3. **Sum Range Operation:**
    - Sum the segments covering the range `[left, right]` by traversing the tree.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
class NumArray {
    constructor(nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        this.n = nums.length;
        this.tree = new Array(2 * this.n);
        this.buildTree();
    }

    buildTree() {
        for (let i = this.n, j = 0; j < this.n; ++i, ++j) {
            this.tree[i] = this.nums[j];
        }
        for (let i = this.n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            this.tree[i] = this.tree[2 * i] + this.tree[2 * i + 1];
        }
    }

    update(index, val) {
        let pos = index + this.n;
        this.tree[pos] = val;
        
        while (pos > 1) {
            let left = pos;
            let right = pos;
            if (pos % 2 === 0) {
                right = pos + 1;
            } else {
                left = pos - 1;
            }
            this.tree[Math.floor(pos / 2)] = this.tree[left] + this.tree[right];
            pos = Math.floor(pos / 2);
        }
    }

    sumRange(left, right) {
        let sum = 0;
        left += this.n;
        right += this.n;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (left % 2 === 1) {
                sum += this.tree[left];
                left++;
            }
            if (right % 2 === 0) {
                sum += this.tree[right];
                right--;
            }
            left = Math.floor(left / 2);
            right = Math.floor(right / 2);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`buildTree`):** O(n)
- **Update (`update`):** O(log n)
- **Query (`sumRange`):** O(log n)

This approach ensures efficient updates and range sum queries, making it suitable for scenarios with frequent operations on the array.
