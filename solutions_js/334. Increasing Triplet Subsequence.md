[Leetcode 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l334)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if there exists a triple of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exist, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array length and its elements?**
   - The length of the array can vary up to 100,000 and the elements can be in the range of `-2^31` to `2^31-1`.

2. **Can the numbers in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements in the array can be negative.

3. **Are duplicate numbers allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed, but they won't affect finding an increasing triplet.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. We will use two variables `first` and `second` to keep track of the smallest and the second smallest numbers found so far.
2. Initialize `first` and `second` to positive infinity.
3. Traverse the array and update `first` and `second` as follows:
   - If current number is less than or equal to `first`, update `first`.
   - Else if current number is less than or equal to `second`, update `second`.
   - Else, a valid `third` number is found which makes `first < second < third`.
   
The algorithm ensures that we find the triplet in a single pass with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.

### Code

```javascript
function increasingTriplet(nums) {
    let first = Infinity;
    let second = Infinity;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num <= first) {
            first = num; // update first if num is smaller than or equal to first
        } else if (num <= second) {
            second = num; // update second if num is smaller than or equal to second
        } else {
            // if we find a number greater than both first and second
            return true; 
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(increasingTriplet([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // true
console.log(increasingTriplet([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])); // false
console.log(increasingTriplet([2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6])); // true
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We are using only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach is optimal for solving the problem efficiently.
