[Leetcode 575. Distribute Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l575)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `candyType` of length `n`, where each number represents a different type of candy, you need to distribute these candies equally to your sibling and yourself. Return the maximum number of different types of candies you can eat. 

Essentially, you should distribute the candies such that you get the maximum possible number of different types of candies, given that you can only eat half of the candies.

### Example
- Input: `candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]`
- Output: `3`

- Input: `candyType = [1,1,2,3]`
- Output: `2`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the number of candies always be even, ensuring a fair distribution? 
    - Yes.
2. Can there be negative number types?
    - No, candy types are non-negative integers.
3. Are there constraints on the length of the array?
    - The length of the array is between 2 and 10,000.

## Strategy
1. Determine the total number of candies you can eat, which is half of the total candies.
2. Calculate the number of unique types of candies.
3. The maximum number of different types of candies you can eat will be the minimum of the total number of unique types and half of the candies, as you can't eat more than you get.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} candyType
 * @return {number}
 */
var distributeCandies = function(candyType) {
    // Calculate maximum candies you can eat
    let maxCandiesToEat = candyType.length / 2;
    
    // Create a set to count unique candy types
    let uniqueCandies = new Set(candyType);
    
    // Calculate unique candy types
    let uniqueCandyCount = uniqueCandies.size;
    
    // Return the minimum of maxCandiesToEat and uniqueCandyCount
    return Math.min(maxCandiesToEat, uniqueCandyCount);
};

// Test cases
console.log(distributeCandies([1,1,2,2,3,3])); // Output: 3
console.log(distributeCandies([1,1,2,3]));    // Output: 2
console.log(distributeCandies([6,6,6,6]));    // Output: 1
console.log(distributeCandies([1,2,3,4,5,6])); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The main operations are setting and retrieving the size of the set. Constructing the set from the array takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Space Complexity:** Using a set to store unique types also requires \(O(n)\) additional space in the worst case.

Overall, the solution is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\).
