[Leetcode 238. Product of Array Except Self](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l238)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The problem should be solved without using division and in O(n) time complexity.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
- Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

### Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain negative numbers? 
   - Yes, the values can be between -30 and 30.
2. Can the input array contain zeroes?
   - Yes.
3. Do we need to handle any exceptionally large arrays? 
   - The length can go up to 100,000.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we canâ€™t directly use division to find the product of the array except self. Instead, we need to use additional arrays to store intermediate products. We will use two passes through the array:

1. **Left Pass**: Calculate the cumulative product of elements to the left of each index.
2. **Right Pass**: Calculate the cumulative product of elements to the right of each index.

We will then combine these intermediate arrays to form the final result.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an array `left_products` such that `left_products[i]` holds the product of all elements to the left of index `i`.
2. Initialize an array `right_products` such that `right_products[i]` holds the product of all elements to the right of index `i`.
3. Initialize the output array `result` where `result[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i]`.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm will run in O(n) time complexity because we make three linear passes through the array (one for `left_products`, one for `right_products`, and one for the final result).
- Space Complexity is O(n) due to the use of additional storage for the intermediate arrays `left_products` and `right_products`.

## Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let result = new Array(n);
    
    // Left products
    let left_products = new Array(n).fill(1);
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        left_products[i] = left_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }
    
    // Right products
    let right_products = new Array(n).fill(1);
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right_products[i] = right_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
    }
    
    // Combine products
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i];
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We create an array `left_products` such that `left_products[i]` holds the product of all elements to the left of `i`.
2. We create an array `right_products` such that `right_products[i]` holds the product of all elements to the right of `i`.
3. We populate the `result` array by multiplying `left_products[i]` with `right_products[i]` for each `i`.

This way, we ensure that each element of `result` correctly represents the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
