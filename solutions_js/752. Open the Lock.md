[Leetcode 752. Open the Lock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l752)
### Problem Statement

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots, labeled `0` to `9`. The wheels can rotate freely, and each rotation changes the slot's number by 1. For example, a wheel that starts at `0` can rotate to `1` or `9`, and a wheel that starts at `9` can rotate to `0` or `8`.

The lock initially starts at `0000`, a string representing the four wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends`, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning, and you cannot unlock it. 

You are given a `target` representing the code that you want to unlock.

Return the minimum total number of turns required to unlock the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `deadends` contain `0000`?
   - Yes, in which case, the lock is already in a deadend and cannot be used.
2. Is it always guaranteed that `target` is not in the `deadends` list?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees this.
3. Can the lock be rotated backwards?
   - Yes, each wheel can be rotated in both directions.

### Code

Let's use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to solve this problem. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as this scenario where each combination of the lock can be thought of as a node in a graph.

```javascript
function openLock(deadends, target) {
    // Create a set for deadends for efficient lookup
    const deadSet = new Set(deadends);
    
    // Check if the initial state is in the deadends
    if (deadSet.has('0000')) return -1;
    
    // Define a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited combinations
    const queue = [['0000', 0]]; // Each element in the queue is [state, numTurns]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add('0000');
    
    // Use BFS to find the shortest path
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [current, turns] = queue.shift();
        
        // Check if we have reached the target
        if (current === target) return turns;
        
        // Generate all possible next states
        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for (let direction of [-1, 1]) {
                // Create a new state by rotating one wheel
                const newState = current.split('');
                newState[i] = (parseInt(newState[i]) + direction + 10) % 10;
                const newCode = newState.join('');
                
                // Only proceed if the new state is not in deadends and not visited
                if (!deadSet.has(newCode) && !visited.has(newCode)) {
                    queue.push([newCode, turns + 1]);
                    visited.add(newCode);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If we exhaust the queue, it's not possible to unlock
    return -1;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the initial state `'0000'`.
   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Each queue element should store the current code and the number of turns taken.
   - Use a set to store deadends for quick lookup and a set to store visited codes.

2. **BFS Loop**:
   - Remove the front element from the queue.
   - Check if it matches the target; return the number of turns if it does.
   - Generate all possible states by rotating each wheel forward and backward.
   - For each new state, if it's not a deadend and has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

3. **Termination**:
   - If the queue is exhausted without finding the target, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(10^4)\) since there are \(10^4\) possible combinations of the lock. Each combination is processed only once due to the visited set, and generating neighboring states involves a constant amount of work.

The space complexity is also \(O(10^4)\) due to the storage needed for the queue and the visited set.
