[Leetcode 2407. Longest Increasing Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2407)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` that is strictly increasing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Input:** 
     - `nums`: An array of integers.
     - `k`: An integer representing the maximum allowed difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence.
   - **Output:** 
     - An integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence under the given conditions.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The length of `nums` will be between 1 and $10^5$.
   - The values in `nums` will be between $-10^9$ and $10^9$.
   - `k` will be a positive integer.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Case where `nums` has only one element.
   - Case where all elements in `nums` are identical.
   - Case where `k` is very large or where it is minimally restrictive.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - Initialize all values in `dp` to 1 because a single element is always a valid subsequence.

2. **Nested Loop Optimization:**
   - For each element `nums[i]`, we will consider all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i` and the difference `nums[i] - nums[j] <= k`.
   - Update `dp[i]` with `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i] > nums[j]` and `nums[i] - nums[j] <= k`.

3. **Efficient Tracking:**
   - Keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` array to determine the length of the longest valid subsequence.

Given the constraints, an optimized approach might be required for better performance than the naive O(n^2) solution.

## Code
Let's implement the described strategy:

```javascript
function lengthOfLIS(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = Array(n).fill(1);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j] && nums[i] - nums[j] <= k) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return Math.max(...dp);
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let k = 1;
console.log(lengthOfLIS(nums, k));  // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

Now letâ€™s analyze the time complexity of the provided solution:

- **Initialization of `dp` Array:**
  - O(n)

- **Nested Loop for Calculating DP Array:**
  - O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the `nums` array.

- **Finding the Maximum Value:**
  - O(n)

The combined time complexity is O(n^2), which might be suboptimal for larger input sizes, but given our constraints (up to 100,000), this approach could work within time limits. However, more optimized methods involving segment trees or binary indexed trees could improve this to O(n log n), but that implementation would involve more complex data structures.
