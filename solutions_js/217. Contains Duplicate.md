[Leetcode 217. Contains Duplicate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l217)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - The input array `nums` can range from 0 to \(10^5\) elements.

2. **What is the range of the values in the input array?**
   - The elements in the array `nums` can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).

3. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - Yes, the array can be empty. An empty array should return `false` as there are no duplicate values.

4. **Are there any special requirements for performance or memory usage?**
   - Ideally, the solution should be efficient in both time and space.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a HashSet data structure, which supports average O(1) time complexity for both insert and lookup operations.

1. Initialize an empty HashSet.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array `nums`.
3. For each element, check if it already exists in the HashSet.
   - If it exists, return `true` as we have found a duplicate.
   - If it does not exist, add the element to the HashSet.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

This approach ensures that we can detect duplicates efficiently.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
var containsDuplicate = function(nums) {
    let seen = new Set();
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            return true;
        }
        seen.add(num);
    }
    
    return false;
};

// Example Usage:

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1];
console.log(containsDuplicate(nums)); // Output: true

const nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(containsDuplicate(nums2)); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because each insertion and lookup operation in the HashSet takes average O(1) time.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)**, as in the worst case, we may need to store all `n` elements in the HashSet.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.
