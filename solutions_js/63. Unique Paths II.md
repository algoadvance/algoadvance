[Leetcode 63. Unique Paths II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l63)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell is either 0 (representing an empty cell) or 1 (representing an obstacle). You need to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner (starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[m-1,n-1]`), where you can only move either down or right at any point.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the expected output if either the start (top-left) or the end (bottom-right) cell is an obstacle?
   - If the start or end cell is an obstacle, the expected output should be 0 because it's impossible to start or reach the end.

2. Are there any constraints about grid size (`m` and `n`) that we should consider?
   - Yes, typical constraints would generally be between 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100.

3. Can we assume the input will always be valid and non-empty?
   - Yes, we can assume the input grid is always a valid m x n grid filled with 0s and 1s.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of unique paths to cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 if the top-left cell is not an obstacle.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the number of ways to reach it by summing the number of ways to reach the cell directly above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the number of ways to reach the cell directly to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).
   - If a cell is an obstacle (`grid[i][j] == 1`), set `dp[i][j]` to 0.

4. **Iterate Through Grid**:
   - Traverse through the grid starting from `(0, 0)` and fill the `dp` array using the above rules.

5. **Output**:
   - The value at `dp[m-1][n-1]` will contain the number of unique paths to finish.

### Code

```javascript
function uniquePathsWithObstacles(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    // If start or end is an obstacle, return 0.
    if (grid[0][0] === 1 || grid[m-1][n-1] === 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Create a DP array and initialize it.
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Starting point
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    
    // Fill the first column.
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = (grid[i][0] === 1) ? 0 : dp[i-1][0];
    }
    
    // Fill the first row.
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = (grid[0][j] === 1) ? 0 : dp[0][j-1];
    }
    
    // Fill the rest of the dp array.
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) — We iterate through each cell in the grid once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) — We maintain an additional 2D array `dp` of the same size as the grid.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique paths considering obstacles and leverages dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
