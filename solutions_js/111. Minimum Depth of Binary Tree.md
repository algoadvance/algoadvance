[Leetcode 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l111)
### Problem Statement
The problem asks to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the tree be empty (i.e., can the root be `null`)?**
   - Yes, if the tree is empty, the minimum depth should be `0`.
2. **What constitutes a leaf node?**
   - A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for problems involving finding the shortest path. BFS will explore the tree level by level, and when we encounter the first leaf node, we can return the depth at that level. 

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function minDepth(root) {
    if (root === null) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const queue = [];
    queue.push({ node: root, depth: 1 });
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const { node, depth } = queue.shift();
        
        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return depth;
        }
        
        if (node.left !== null) {
            queue.push({ node: node.left, depth: depth + 1 });
        }
        
        if (node.right !== null) {
            queue.push({ node: node.right, depth: depth + 1 });
        }
    }
}

// Example Usage:
// let root = new TreeNode(1);
// root.left = new TreeNode(2);
// root.right = new TreeNode(3);
// root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
// root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
// console.log(minDepth(root)); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Case:**
   - If the tree is empty (`root === null`), return `0`.

2. **BFS Initialization:**
   - Use a queue to facilitate level-order traversal.
   - Enqueue the root node with an initial depth of `1`.

3. **Level-Order Traversal:**
   - Dequeue an item from the queue.
   - If the node is a leaf (both `left` and `right` children are `null`), return its depth.
   - Enqueue the left and right children of the current node with an updated depth.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we have to visit all nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the queue, which in the worst case could hold all nodes of the bottommost level (approximately `n/2`).
