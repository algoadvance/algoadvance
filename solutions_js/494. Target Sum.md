[Leetcode 494. Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l494)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an expression out of `nums` by adding one of the symbols `+` and `-` before each integer in `nums` and then concatenate all the integers.

For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `+` before `2` and a `-` before `1` and then concatenate them to form the expression `+2-1`. 

Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to the `target`.

#### Example:
- Example 1:
  - Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
  - Output: 5
  - Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of `nums` be equal to `target`.
  
- Example 2:
  - Input: nums = [1], target = 1
  - Output: 1

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
   
2. What are the constraints on the values in `nums` and `target`?
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
   - `0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000`
   - `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

3. Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
   - Yes.

### Strategy:

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sub-problems Identification**: We need to determine different ways to add/subtract elements from `nums` to achieve `target`.
2. **State Definition**: Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to assign symbols to the first `i` numbers to get sum `j`.
3. **Transition**: 
   - For each element `nums[i]`, we can either add it to or subtract it from the sum.
   - Therefore, `dp[i][j + nums[i]] += dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j - nums[i]] += dp[i-1][j]`.
4. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp[0][0] = 1` since there's only one way to assign symbols to get sum `0` with `0` elements (do nothing).
   - All other states initialized to `0`.
5. **Final State Extraction**: The value at `dp[n][target]` will give the required number of ways.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is `O(n*sum(nums))` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` array. Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient.

### Code:

```javascript
function findTargetSumWays(nums, target) {
    const sum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    
    // Edge case, to ensure the target is reachable.
    if (sum < Math.abs(target) || (sum + target) % 2 !== 0) return 0;

    const neededSum = (sum + target) / 2;
    const dp = new Array(neededSum + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (let n of nums) {
        for (let j = neededSum; j >= n; j--) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - n];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[neededSum];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sum Validation**: The `target` must be achievable based on the `sum` of the array elements. If `sum < Math.abs(target)` or `(sum + target) % 2 !== 0`, return 0 since the target is unreachable.
2. **DP Initialization**: Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` stores the number of ways to get sum `j`.
3. **DP State Transition**: For each element in `nums`, update the DP table from the end to ensure we don't reuse the same element.
4. **Result Extraction**: Return the number of ways to achieve `neededSum` which is `(sum + target) / 2`.

By pre-validating and correctly using dynamic programming, we can efficiently solve the problem within the constraints.
