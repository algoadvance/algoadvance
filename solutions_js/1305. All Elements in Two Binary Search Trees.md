## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1305: **All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees**

Given two binary search trees `root1` and `root2`, return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the tree nodes?**
   - Nodes can have integer values, which can cover typical integer ranges in JavaScript (-2^31 to 2^31 - 1).

2. **What if one or both of the roots are `null`?**
   - If a root is `null`, it means there are no nodes in that tree, so we should just consider the other tree for merging.

3. **Do the trees contain duplicate values?**
   - Since these are binary search trees and typically duplicates are either disallowed or managed uniquely (unique insertion rule), we consider only the scenario without duplicates.

## Strategy

1. **In-Order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of each tree to gather the elements. Since an in-order traversal of a BST results in a sorted list of elements, this will give us two sorted arrays.
2. **Merge Sorted Arrays**: Merge the two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

### Steps
1. Define a helper function to perform in-order traversal of a binary search tree.
2. Traverse both trees individually to get two sorted lists of elements.
3. Merge the two sorted lists using a two-pointer technique to maintain order.

## Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var getAllElements = function(root1, root2) {
    const inorderTraversal = (root) => {
        const result = [];
        const stack = [];
        let current = root;

        while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
            while (current !== null) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current.left;
            }
            current = stack.pop();
            result.push(current.val);
            current = current.right;
        }

        return result;
    };

    const mergeSortedArrays = (arr1, arr2) => {
        const merged = [];
        let i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length) {
            if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
                merged.push(arr1[i]);
                i++;
            } else {
                merged.push(arr2[j]);
                j++;
            }
        }

        while (i < arr1.length) {
            merged.push(arr1[i]);
            i++;
        }

        while (j < arr2.length) {
            merged.push(arr2[j]);
            j++;
        }

        return merged;
    };

    const arr1 = inorderTraversal(root1);
    const arr2 = inorderTraversal(root2);

    return mergeSortedArrays(arr1, arr2);
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **In-Order Traversal**: `O(N1 + N2)` where `N1` is the number of nodes in `root1` and `N2` is the number of nodes in `root2`.
2. **Merge Operation**: `O(N1 + N2)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N1 + N2)`.

## Space Complexity

1. **In-Order Traversal**: O(N1 + N2) for storing the elements.
2. **Auxiliary Space for Merging**: O(N1 + N2)

Overall space complexity is O(N1 + N2), as we are storing the elements from both trees along with the merged result.
