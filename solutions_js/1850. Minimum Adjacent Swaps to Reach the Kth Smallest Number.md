[Leetcode 1850. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1850)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `num` and an integer `k`, you need to apply the `k-th` smallest permutation derived lexicographically by swapping the digits in the smallest number of adjacent swaps. You are required to return the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to transform the initial permutation to the `k-th` smallest permutation.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of the string `num`? 
    - What is the range of `k`?

   **Expected Answer:**
   - The length of `num` can be up to 1000 digits.
   - `k` is an integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ 1000`.

2. **Output Format:**
    - Should the function return just the number of swaps?
    - Is there any specific condition for the output format?

    **Expected Answer:**
    - Yes, the function should return the minimum number of adjacent swaps as an integer.

3. **Sorting Clarification:**
    - Does "smallest lexicographic permutation" mean we need to use all digits?

    **Expected Answer:**
    - Yes, use all digits of the string while rearranging to get the k-th smallest permutation.

### Strategy:

1. **Finding the K-th Smallest Permutation:**
   - Generate the k-th smallest permutation with the next permutation method (`k` times).

2. **Calculating Minimum Adjacent Swaps:**
   - Compare the original string `num` with the k-th smallest permutation.
   - Determine the required swaps by comparing the current state with the target permutation.

### Code:

```javascript
function getNextPermutation(numArr) {
    let i = numArr.length - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && numArr[i] >= numArr[i + 1]) {
        i--;
    }
    if (i >= 0) {
        let j = numArr.length - 1;
        while (numArr[j] <= numArr[i]) {
            j--;
        }
        [numArr[i], numArr[j]] = [numArr[j], numArr[i]];
    }
    let l = i + 1, r = numArr.length - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        [numArr[l], numArr[r]] = [numArr[r], numArr[l]];
        l++;
        r--;
    }
}

function getMinSwaps(num, k) {
    let originalNum = num.split('');
    let targetNum = [...originalNum];
    
    // Generate k-th permutation
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        getNextPermutation(targetNum);
    }
    
    // Calculate minimum swaps
    let totalSwaps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < originalNum.length; i++) {
        if (originalNum[i] !== targetNum[i]) {
            let j = i;
            while (originalNum[j] !== targetNum[i]) {
                j++;
            }
            while (j > i) {
                [originalNum[j], originalNum[j - 1]] = [originalNum[j - 1], originalNum[j]];
                totalSwaps++;
                j--;
            }
        }
    }
    return totalSwaps;
}

// Example usage:
const num = "5489355142";
const k = 4;
console.log(getMinSwaps(num, k));   // Output the minimum number of adjacent swaps
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Generating Permutation:**
   - For generating the k-th permutation: O(k * n), where `n` is the length of the string `num`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Swaps:**
   - For each element of the string, the worst case is an average of `n` swaps: O(n^2) in total.

Overall, the combined time complexity is `O(k * n + n^2)`.
