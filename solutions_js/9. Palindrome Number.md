[Leetcode 9. Palindrome Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l9)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward. For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input integer be negative?**
   - Yes, a negative number cannot be a palindrome due to the presence of the negative sign.
   
2. **Is there a constraint on the size of the integer?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically we can assume it fits within the standard 32-bit signed integer range (`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`).

3. **Can the input integer be zero?**
   - Yes, zero is a palindrome as it reads the same forward and backward.

## Strategy

To determine whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome, we will:

1. Handle negative numbers: Immediately return `false` if `x` is negative.
2. Reverse the digits of the integer and compare it with the original number:
   - Extract the last digit of the number and build the reversed number (by appending digits from the end).
   - Compare the reversed number with the original number.

This approach avoids converting the integer to a string, thus maintaining a more integer-focused solution.

## Code

```javascript
function isPalindrome(x) {
    // Negative numbers are not palindromes
    if (x < 0) return false;

    // Initialize variables
    let original = x;
    let reversed = 0;

    // Reverse the number
    while (x !== 0) {
        let digit = x % 10;
        reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
        x = Math.floor(x / 10);
    }

    // Check if original and reversed numbers are the same
    return original === reversed;
}

// Example test cases
console.log(isPalindrome(121)); // true
console.log(isPalindrome(-121)); // false
console.log(isPalindrome(10)); // false
console.log(isPalindrome(0)); // true
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(log10(n))**, where `n` is the input integer. This is because we are effectively processing each digit of the number, and the number of digits in `n` is given by `log10(n)`.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input.
