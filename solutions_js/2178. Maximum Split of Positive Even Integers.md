[Leetcode 2178. Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2178)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `finalSum`, split it into a maximum number of unique positive even integers. Return the maximum number of integers in the split. If it's not possible to split `finalSum` into unique positive even integers, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `finalSum` be negative or zero?**
   - No, the problem specifies it's a positive integer.

2. **What should the function return if a split isn't possible?**
   - Return an empty array `[]`.

3. **Are the integers in the returned array supposed to be sorted?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but typically in such cases, outputting a sorted array is a good practice.

### Strategy

- Initialize an empty array `result` to store the unique even integers.
- Start with the smallest even integer, which is `2`.
- Keep adding the smallest possible even integer to `result` until adding the next even integer would exceed `finalSum`.
- Finally, check:
  - If the number left to reach `finalSum` is already a part of `result`, then such a split is not possible.
  - Otherwise, include the leftover in the list.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(âˆšn), where n is the `finalSum`. This is because the sum of the first k even integers is k(k + 1), and we iterate until this sum reaches n.

### Code

```javascript
const maximumEvenSplit = (finalSum) => {
    if (finalSum % 2 !== 0) return [];

    let result = [];
    let currentEven = 2;
    let sum = 0;

    while (sum + currentEven <= finalSum) {
        result.push(currentEven);
        sum += currentEven;
        currentEven += 2; // move to the next even number
    }
    
    // Add the remaining part to the last element to make the total sum `finalSum`
    if (sum !== finalSum) {
        result[result.length - 1] += finalSum - sum;
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumEvenSplit(12)); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
console.log(maximumEvenSplit(28)); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 16]
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check**: If `finalSum` is odd, return an empty array immediately.
2. **Loop**: Use a while loop to keep adding the smallest even integer starting from 2, and incrementing by 2 each time.
3. **Condition Check**: Ensure that the sum does not exceed `finalSum`.
4. **Final Touch**: If the sum of the integers in the array is less than `finalSum`, adjust the last added number to make up the difference.
5. **Return Result**: This results in an array of unique even integers that sum up to `finalSum`.

This approach ensures that we use the maximum number of unique even integers efficiently.
