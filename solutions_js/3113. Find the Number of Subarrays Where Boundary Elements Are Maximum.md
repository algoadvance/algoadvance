[Leetcode 3113. Find the Number of Subarrays Where Boundary Elements Are Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3113)
## Problem Statement

This problem is asking us to find the number of subarrays within a given array where the maximum element of the subarray is exclusively one of the boundary elements—i.e., the maximum element of the subarray occurs at the first or the last position of that subarray.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** What is the format of the input?
   - The input consists of a single array of integers.

2. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the array's length?
   - What are the values of the array elements?

3. **Output Format:** What should the output be?
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of subarrays that meet the criteria.

Based on general LeetCode problems, let's assume the array length is `n` where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), and elements of the array are integers within a reasonable range, e.g., \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to keep the following points in mind:

1. **Identify maximal boundaries:** We need to identify subarrays where the maximum element is either at the start or end of the subarray.
2. **Two pointer technique:** Use pointers to keep track of potential subarrays.
3. **Iterate through elements:** Check subarrays starting from each element, extending to the next elements iteratively until the condition is violated.

## Plan

1. Initialize a variable to count the number of valid subarrays.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - For each starting index, check subarrays ending at subsequent indices.
   - Check whether the boundary elements are the maximum in that subarray.
3. Return the total count of valid subarrays.

## Code

Here's a detailed implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var numOfSubarraysWhereBoundaryElementsAreMaximum = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let maxElement = nums[i];
        
        // Check subarrays starting from i
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            maxElement = Math.max(maxElement, nums[j]);

            // Check if the max element is at one of the boundaries
            if (nums[i] === maxElement || nums[j] === maxElement) {
                count++;
            } else {
                // Once the condition is violated, no need to check further subarrays from i to j
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. This is due to the nested loops—one that starts from each element and the inner one that checks subarrays ending at every subsequent element.
- Given the constraints, this quadratic time complexity can still be inefficient for large input sizes (up to \(10^5\)). However, it's a straightforward approach and easy to understand. Further optimization can be done if necessary.

This implementation meets the problem requirements and correctly counts the subarrays according to the specified condition.
