[Leetcode 2383. Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2383)
## Problem Statement

You are an athlete preparing for a competition. The competition involves a series of events, each requiring different levels of strength and energy. You have been given your initial levels of energy and strength and the required levels of energy and strength to complete each event. You need to train to reach the required levels before you can participate.

Write a function that calculates the minimum number of hours of training required to meet or exceed the required levels of energy and strength for all events.

### Input
* Initial energy level: `initialEnergy` (integer)
* Initial strength level: `initialStrength` (integer)
* Required energy levels: `requiredEnergies` (array of integers)
* Required strength levels: `requiredStrengths` (array of integers)

### Output
* An integer representing the minimum number of hours of training required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the initial levels of energy and strength be negative?
   - No, they will be non-negative integers.
   
2. Is it guaranteed that the lengths of `requiredEnergies` and `requiredStrengths` arrays are the same?
   - Yes, they will be of the same length.

3. If the initial levels already meet the required levels, is additional training still necessary?
   - No, if the initial levels already meet or exceed all required levels, no additional training is necessary.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the required levels.
2. Calculate the deficit in energy and strength if any for each event.
3. Sum up these deficits to get the minimum hours of training required.
4. Return the total hours of training required.

## Implementation

```javascript
function minTrainingHours(initialEnergy, initialStrength, requiredEnergies, requiredStrengths) {
    let totalTrainingHours = 0;
    let currentEnergy = initialEnergy;
    let currentStrength = initialStrength;

    for (let i = 0; i < requiredEnergies.length; i++) {
        if (requiredEnergies[i] > currentEnergy) {
            totalTrainingHours += (requiredEnergies[i] - currentEnergy);
            currentEnergy = requiredEnergies[i];
        }

        if (requiredStrengths[i] > currentStrength) {
            totalTrainingHours += (requiredStrengths[i] - currentStrength);
            currentStrength = requiredStrengths[i];
        }
    }

    return totalTrainingHours;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minTrainingHours(5, 10, [2, 3, 7], [1, 5, 8]));  // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `requiredEnergies` or `requiredStrengths` arrays. This is because we iterate through each required level once.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
