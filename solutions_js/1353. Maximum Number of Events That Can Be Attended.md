[Leetcode 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1353)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` if you attend the event on any day `d` where `startDayi <= d <= endDayi`. You can only attend one event at any given day `d`.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the start and end days of the events?**
   - The values of start and end days can typically be within the range of 1 to 10^5.
   
2. **Are the events guaranteed to be non-overlapping?**
   - No, the events are not guaranteed to be non-overlapping.

3. **What should be done if two events overlap on the same day?**
   - Prioritize the event that ends earlier, but if required we can only attend one event per day.

### Strategy

We can use a greedy algorithm with a priority queue (min-heap) to solve this problem. The main steps are:

1. **Sort Events by Start Day:** Sort all the events based on their start days. This allows us to iterate through the events in the order they become available.
  
2. **Use a Min-Heap:** Use a min-heap to keep track of the events' end days. This lets us easily find the event that ends the earliest among the current active events.

3. **Attend Events:** Traverse through each day, from the earliest event's start day to the latest possible end day:
   - Add events that start on the current day to the min-heap.
   - Remove events from the min-heap that have already ended (i.e., their end day is before the current day).
   - Attend the event that ends the earliest (if any), then remove it from the heap.
   
4. **Count Attended Events:** Keep a count of how many events have been attended.

### Code

```javascript
function maxEvents(events) {
    // Step 1: Sort events by their start day
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue();
    let eventIndex = 0;
    let attended = 0;
    let maxDay = Math.max(...events.map(event => event[1]));
    
    // Step 4: Traverse from day 1 to the last possible end day
    for (let day = 1; day <= maxDay; day++) {
        // Step 2: Add all events that start on this day to the heap
        while (eventIndex < events.length && events[eventIndex][0] === day) {
            minHeap.enqueue(events[eventIndex][1]);
            eventIndex++;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Remove events that have already ended
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.front().element < day) {
            minHeap.dequeue();
        }
        
        // Step 4b: Attend the event that ends the earliest
        if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            minHeap.dequeue();
            attended++;
        }
    }
    
    return attended;
}
```

Here, I use the `MinPriorityQueue` from an implementation available in some JavaScript environments, which behaves like a min-heap. You might need to use a custom implementation if your environment does not support it.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Events:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of events.
- **Min-Heap Operations:** Each event can be added/removed from the heap once, so heap operations take `O(n log n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This solution is efficient and handles the problem constraints well.
