[Leetcode 3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3191)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`, your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make every element in `nums` equal to `1`. In one operation, you can select any index `i` of the array and set `nums[i]` to 1.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few points:
1. Can the array be empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
3. Is it guaranteed that there are no pre-existing `1`s in the array?

Assuming that the array is non-empty and can contain any combination of `0`s and `1`s, let's proceed to the strategy.

### Strategy
Given that each operation allows us to set any element `nums[i]` to 1, the minimum number of operations required to make each element equal to 1 is simply equal to the number of `0`s in the array. This is because each `0` must be set to `1`.

### Solution
We will:
1. Traverse the array `nums`.
2. Count the number of `0`s.
3. Return the count as the minimum number of operations required.

Let's implement this in JavaScript.

### Code
```javascript
function minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(nums) {
    // Initialize a counter for zeros
    let zeroCount = 0;
    
    // Traverse the array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        }
    }
    
    // The number of operations needed is equal to the count of zeros
    return zeroCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we traverse the entire array once to count the number of `0`s.

This solution is efficient, with a linear time complexity in terms of the size of the array.
