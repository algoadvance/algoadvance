[Leetcode 390. Elimination Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l390)
### Problem Statement

You have a list `arr` of all the integers in the range `1` to `n` sorted in a strictly increasing order. Applying the following operations until only one integer remains:

1. Start from the left, remove the first number and every other number afterward until reaching the end of the list.
2. Repeat the steps again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining elements.

You keep on alternating the operations until only one number remains in the list.

Return the last remaining number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Type:** Is the input always a positive integer?
   - Yes, `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Output:** Should the output be a single integer?
   - Yes, the output is a single integer that is the last number remaining after the elimination process.

3. **Efficiency:** Are there any specific constraints on the size of `n`?
   - The problem doesn't specify, but typically constraints will be large enough to require an efficient solution.

### Strategy

This is a math-based problem that can be optimized significantly to avoid simulation of the removal process. Here's an intuitive approach to solve it:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with the first number and consider left-to-right elimination first.

2. **Elimination Pattern:**
   - In left-to-right elimination, every first element and every other element is removed.
   - This will effectively reduce the sequence to half.
   - In right-to-left elimination, the process starts from the rightmost element.

3. **Tracking Position Changes:**
   - Use variables to track the current start of the remaining sequence, the step size, and the direction of elimination.
   - After each pass, update these variables according to the direction of elimination.

### Code

```javascript
function lastRemaining(n) {
    let head = 1;
    let step = 1;
    let left = true;
    let remaining = n;
    
    while (remaining > 1) {
        if (left || remaining % 2 === 1) {
            head += step;
        }
        remaining = Math.floor(remaining / 2);
        step *= 2;
        left = !left;
    }
    
    return head;
}

// Example usage
console.log(lastRemaining(9)); // Output: 6
```

### Explanation
- **Variables:**
  - `head` tracks the current start of the sequence.
  - `step` is the distance between consecutive remaining numbers in the current sequence.
  - `left` is a boolean flag indicating the direction of elimination (true for left-to-right, false for right-to-left).
  - `remaining` is the count of numbers left.

- **While Loop:**
  - The loop continues until we are down to one number (`remaining > 1`).
  - If eliminating from left or if the count of remaining numbers is odd, update the head (`head += step`).
  - Halve the remaining count: `remaining = Math.floor(remaining / 2)`.
  - Double the step size: `step *= 2`.
  - Toggle the direction of elimination (`left = !left`).

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(log n)** due to the halving process in each iteration.
- **Space complexity** is **O(1)** since only a fixed number of variables are used.

This solution efficiently determines the last remaining number without explicitly simulating the entire elimination process.
