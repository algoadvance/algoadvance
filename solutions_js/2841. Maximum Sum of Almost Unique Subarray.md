[Leetcode 2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2841)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum sum of a subarray containing exactly `k` elements such that the sum is as large as possible and the subarray contains at most `m` distinct elements.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1], k = 3, m = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [2, 1, 2] contains exactly two distinct elements and sums to 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the arrays always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the problem assumes that the input array `nums` will always have elements.
2. **Can `k` be larger than the length of the array?**
   - No, `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of the array.
3. **What should be returned if no such subarray exists?**
   - Return `0` if no such subarray exists.

## Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window to evaluate subarrays of length `k`.
   - Maintain a count of distinct elements within the window.
   - Check if the window satisfies the constraint of at most `m` distinct elements and calculate the sum.
   - Update the maximum sum if the current window's sum is greater than the previously recorded sum.
   
2. **Steps:**
   - Initialize a window with the first `k` elements and compute its sum.
   - Use a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of elements within the window.
   - Slide the window by moving the start and end pointers.
   - Update the hashmap and sum accordingly.
   - Keep track of the maximum sum of windows that meet the criteria of having at most `m` distinct elements.

## Code
```javascript
function maxSumOfAlmostUniqueSubarray(nums, k, m) {
    let maxSum = 0;
    let windowSum = 0;
    let windowStart = 0;
    let frequencyMap = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let endNum = nums[i];
        windowSum += endNum;

        frequencyMap.set(endNum, (frequencyMap.get(endNum) || 0) + 1);

        if (i - windowStart + 1 > k) {
            let startNum = nums[windowStart];
            windowSum -= startNum;
            if (frequencyMap.get(startNum) === 1) {
                frequencyMap.delete(startNum);
            } else {
                frequencyMap.set(startNum, frequencyMap.get(startNum) - 1);
            }
            windowStart++;
        }

        if (i - windowStart + 1 === k) {
            if (frequencyMap.size <= m) {
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We only traverse each element once with the sliding window technique.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the maximum number of distinct elements allowed in the window, which in the worst case can be equal to `k` in the hashmap.

This should efficiently find the maximum sum of a subarray containing exactly `k` elements with at most `m` distinct elements.
