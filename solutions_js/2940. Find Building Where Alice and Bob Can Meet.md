[Leetcode 2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2940)
### Problem Statement:
Alice and Bob live in a city with `n` buildings in a straight line, indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. They want to meet at a building such that the total travel distance is minimized. Alice is currently at building `alices_current_building` and Bob is currently at building `bobs_current_building`. Travel distance is defined as the absolute difference between the indices of two buildings. 

Write a function `minDistToMeet(n, alices_current_building, bobs_current_building)` that returns the building index where Alice and Bob can meet such that their total travel distance is minimized. If there are multiple buildings with the same minimized total travel distance, return the smallest index.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are all buildings consecutive and indexed from 0 to n-1?**
   - Yes.
2. **Is it guaranteed that `n`, `alices_current_building`, and `bobs_current_building` are valid (e.g., within their respective ranges)?**
   - Yes.
3. **Can Alice and Bob be at the same building initially?**
   - Yes.
4. **Should we consider edge cases, such as n = 1?**
   - Yes, we should always consider edge cases.

### Strategy:
To minimize the total travel distance for both Alice and Bob, we need to find the meeting point that minimizes the sum of their individual distances from their starting points. 

Here's how you can approach the problem:

1. **Midpoint Approach:** The optimal meeting point could be approximately the midpoint of Alice's and Bob's current positions. The intuitive idea is to bring both parties as close to each other as possible.
2. **Evaluate Distance:** Calculate the total travel distance required for each building. This will require checking every building from index `0` to `n-1`.

We will iterate through the buildings and calculate the travel distance for each building. We'll keep track of the building with the minimum total travel distance. 

### Code:
```javascript
function minDistToMeet(n, alices_current_building, bobs_current_building) {
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    let meetingBuilding = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const aliceDistance = Math.abs(i - alices_current_building);
        const bobDistance = Math.abs(i - bobs_current_building);
        const totalDistance = aliceDistance + bobDistance;
        
        if (totalDistance < minDistance) {
            minDistance = totalDistance;
            meetingBuilding = i;
        }
    }
    
    return meetingBuilding;
}

// Example test cases
console.log(minDistToMeet(10, 2, 6)); // Output might be 4
console.log(minDistToMeet(5, 0, 4));  // Output should be 2
console.log(minDistToMeet(1, 0, 0));  // Output should be 0 (only one building)
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** because we iterate through each building once, calculating the distance and keeping track of the minimum.

- We iterate from `0` to `n-1` (O(n)).
- For each building, we calculate the absolute distance from Alice's and Bob's current positions (O(1) per calculation).

Thus, the overall complexity is **O(n)**.
