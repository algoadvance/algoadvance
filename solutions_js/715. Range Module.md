[Leetcode 715. Range Module](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l715)
### Problem Statement

The **Range Module** is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. We want to be able to add ranges, remove ranges, and query ranges. Specifically, we need to implement the following functionalities:

- `void addRange(int left, int right)`: Adds the range `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval. Adding the same range multiple times should be idempotent.
- `boolean queryRange(int left, int right)`: Returns true if every real number in the interval `[left, right)` is currently being tracked.
- `void removeRange(int left, int right)`: Stops tracking every real number in the interval `[left, right)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** What are the constraints on the values of `left` and `right`?
   - **Answer:** All values will be integers and you can assume standard constraints typically found in problem statements (for example, `1 <= left < right <= 10^9`).

2. **Question:** Can the ranges overlap?
   - **Answer:** Yes, ranges can overlap and the module should handle merging of intervals during addition operations.

3. **Question:** If `left == right`, is this considered a range?
   - **Answer:** No, `[left, right)` is an empty range when `left == right`.

### Strategy

To handle the required functionalities efficiently, we can use an interval tree data structure such as `SortedDict` from `collections` in Python or a home-grown structure in JavaScript for managing the intervals. Here's a step-by-step strategy for each method:

1. **addRange(left, right):**
   - Merge overlapping or adjacent intervals into the interval `[left, right)`.

2. **queryRange(left, right):**
   - Check if the interval `[left, right)` is completely covered by the existing intervals.

3. **removeRange(left, right):**
   - Remove the interval `[left, right)` and split any intersecting intervals as necessary.

### Code

Here's a potential JavaScript solution to the problem using a `Map` to simulate the interval management:

```javascript
class RangeModule {
    constructor() {
        this.intervals = new Map();
    }

    addRange(left, right) {
        let newIntervals = new Map();
        for (let [l, r] of this.intervals) {
            if (r < left || l > right) {
                newIntervals.set(l, r);
            } else {
                left = Math.min(left, l);
                right = Math.max(right, r);
            }
        }
        newIntervals.set(left, right);
        this.intervals = newIntervals;
    }

    queryRange(left, right) {
        for (let [l, r] of this.intervals) {
            if (l <= left && right <= r) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    removeRange(left, right) {
        let newIntervals = new Map();
        for (let [l, r] of this.intervals) {
            if (r <= left || l >= right) {
                newIntervals.set(l, r);
            } else {
                if (l < left) {
                    newIntervals.set(l, left);
                }
                if (r > right) {
                    newIntervals.set(right, r);
                }
            }
        }
        this.intervals = newIntervals;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **addRange:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of intervals, because we need to check and potentially merge each interval.
- **queryRange:** \(O(N)\) in the worst case, although it can be optimized with better interval searching algorithms.
- **removeRange:** \(O(N)\), similar to `addRange` because we need to check and potentially split intervals.

This implementation is straightforward but can be optimized using more advanced data structures for better performance in larger scales. For competitive programming or production, advanced interval trees or balanced BSTs are recommended.
