[Leetcode 3219. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3219)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` rectangular cake that you want to cut, you need to cut it into smaller pieces. Each cut has a cost associated with it. The cost of a cut is equal to the length of the side that is being cut. You need to cut the cake in such a way that the total cost of all cuts is minimized. You are required to output the minimum cost to cut the cake into exactly `k` pieces.

### Input

- An integer `m` representing the length of the cake.
- An integer `n` representing the breadth of the cake.
- An integer `k` representing the number of pieces.

### Output

- An integer representing the minimum cost to cut the cake into exactly `k` pieces.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we have `k` greater than `m * n`?
2. What is the format of the input? Is each value provided separately or all in one line?
3. Are all values guaranteed to be positive integers?
4. Can we assume that the dimensions of the cake and `k` are feasible for a solution?

### Code

Let's assume that for the given problem:

1. Dimensions `m` and `n` are large enough to allow at least `k` cuts.
2. Inputs will be provided as separate integers.

### Strategy

Given the nature of the problem, it appears to be a dynamic programming problem where we want to minimize the cost of making cuts. Here's how we can tackle it:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:** Create a DP table to store the minimum costs for cutting the cake.
2. **Subproblem Identification:** Identify the cost of smaller subproblems.
3. **Constraints:** Ensure the functional constraints are respected while making cuts.

We need a 3D DP table where `dp[l][w][p]` represents the minimum cost to cut a cake of dimensions `l x w` into `p` pieces.

Here's a possible approach:

1. Initialize a 3D DP array with dimensions `m+1 x n+1 x k+1` with high values (since we want to find the minimum).
2. Set `dp[m][n][1]` = 0 as the base case, because no cuts are needed for one piece.
3. Iterate through all possible sub-dimensions and compute costs for each number of pieces by considering both horizontal and vertical cuts.

### Implementation

```javascript
function minCostForCuttingCake(m, n, k) {
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m+1 }, () => Array.from({ length: n+1 }, () => Array(k+1).fill(Infinity)));
    
    // Base case: cost to cut a m x n cake into 1 piece is 0
    dp[m][n][1] = 0;
    
    // Iterate over all possible lengths and widths
    for (let l = 1; l <= m; ++l) {
        for (let w = 1; w <= n; ++w) {
            // Iterate over all possible numbers of pieces
            for (let pieces = 2; pieces <= k; ++pieces) {
                // Check horizontal cuts
                for (let i = 1; i < l; ++i) {
                    for (let p = 1; p < pieces; ++p) {
                        dp[l][w][pieces] = Math.min(dp[l][w][pieces], dp[i][w][p] + dp[l-i][w][pieces-p] + w);
                    }
                }
                // Check vertical cuts
                for (let j = 1; j < w; ++j) {
                    for (let p = 1; p < pieces; ++p) {
                        dp[l][w][pieces] = Math.min(dp[l][w][pieces], dp[l][j][p] + dp[l][w-j][pieces-p] + l);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n][k];
}

// Example usage
console.log(minCostForCuttingCake(4, 4, 4)); // Expected output might be an example valid minimum cost to split a 4x4 cake into 4 pieces
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n * k^2 * max(m, n))`. Hereâ€™s how we derive that:

1. We have to fill a 3D table of size `m x n x k`.
2. For each entry in the table, we consider every possible horizontal and vertical cut, which could be up to `m` and `n` respectively.
3. For each cut, we consider up to `k` combinations of pieces.

This results in a potentially high but manageable complexity for typical constraints in competitive programming.
