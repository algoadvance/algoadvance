[Leetcode 2105. Watering Plants II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2105)
Absolutely! Let's start with the problem statement to understand what we're working on.

### Problem Statement

Youâ€™re given an array `plants`, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `i-th` plant needs. You have two workers, Alice and Bob, who are both carrying full watering cans initially. Each can hold a maximum of `capacityA` and `capacityB` liters of water respectively.

They water the plants in the following order:
- Alice starts watering the plants from the beginning of the array, moving right.
- Bob starts watering the plants from the end of the array, moving left.

They meet at some plant or cross each other and stop there.

You need to determine the minimum number of refills required for Alice and Bob to water all the plants.

### Clarifying Questions
 
1. Do Alice and Bob start at the same position?
   - **No**, Alice starts from the beginning of the array (index 0), and Bob starts from the end of the array (the last index).

2. Can Alice and Bob water the same plant?
   - **No**, they cannot water the same plant, as the problem states they stop once they meet or cross each other.

3. What happens when Alice or Bob run out of water?
   - They have to go back to the river to refill their watering cans. Each refill is counted.

4. Is it guaranteed that there will always be a valid solution?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that they will completely water all the plants.

### Strategy

1. We will simulate the process of Alice watering from left to right, and Bob watering from right to left.
2. We will keep track of the current water in each of their cans.
3. If either of them cannot water the next plant due to insufficient water, they will refill and we increment the refill count.
4. We stop when Alice and Bob cross paths or meet at the same plant.

### Code

```javascript
function wateringPlantsII(plants, capacityA, capacityB) {
    let refillsA = 0, refillsB = 0;
    let currentA = capacityA, currentB = capacityB;
    
    let i = 0, j = plants.length - 1;
    
    while (i <= j) {
        // Alice waters a plant
        if (i == j) {
            // If both at same plant, only one can water it
            if (currentA >= plants[i] || currentB >= plants[i]) {
                if (currentA >= currentB) {
                    if (currentA < plants[i]) {
                        refillsA++;
                        currentA = capacityA;
                    }
                    currentA -= plants[i];
                } else {
                    if (currentB < plants[i]) {
                        refillsB++;
                        currentB = capacityB;
                    }
                    currentB -= plants[i];
                }
            } else {
                // Refill required if neither can water the plant
                refillsA++;
                refillsB++;
            }
            break;
        }
        
        // Alice's turn
        if (currentA < plants[i]) {
            refillsA++;
            currentA = capacityA;
        }
        currentA -= plants[i];
        i++;
        
        // Bob's turn
        if (currentB < plants[j]) {
            refillsB++;
            currentB = capacityB;
        }
        currentB -= plants[j];
        j--;
    }
    
    return refillsA + refillsB;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of plants. Each plant is processed exactly once by either Alice or Bob.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), no extra space other than variables used for counting and tracking positions.

This solution effectively models the described scenario and ensures that both workers successfully water all the plants with the minimum number of refills.
