[Leetcode 2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2244)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the number of tasks to complete. You have to finish all the tasks via rounds. In one round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same type.

Return the minimum rounds required to complete all tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all tasks.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
    - What is the minimum and maximum length of the `tasks` array?
    - What are the possible values for `tasks[i]`?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum rounds required or -1 if it's not possible?

3. **Task format**:
    - Are there any constraints on the similarity of tasks?
    - For example, are all tasks of the same type or do they need to be categorized?

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**:
    - Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each task type.
    
2. **Rounds Calculation**:
    - For each count value, determine the minimum number of rounds required to complete the tasks of that type.
    - If the count is 1, return -1 immediately since it's impossible to complete the task in rounds of 2 or 3.
    - For other counts, use a combination of 2 and 3 to minimize the number of rounds.
    - If a count is exactly divisible by 3, we prefer using `3` tasks per round.
    - If a count leaves a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3, adjust the rounds accordingly.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minimumRounds(tasks) {
    const taskCount = new Map();

    for (let task of tasks) {
        if (taskCount.has(task)) {
            taskCount.set(task, taskCount.get(task) + 1);
        } else {
            taskCount.set(task, 1);
        }
    }

    let rounds = 0;

    for (let [task, count] of taskCount) {
        if (count === 1) {
            return -1;  // Not possible to complete this task
        }

        if (count % 3 === 0) {
            rounds += count / 3;
        } else {
            rounds += Math.floor(count / 3) + 1;
        }
    }

    return rounds;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tasks in the input array. This is because we iterate through the array once to populate the frequency map and then iterate through the map to determine the number of rounds.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of unique tasks. This is due to the hashmap storing the frequency of each task type.

By following this strategy, we ensure that the solution computes the minimum number of rounds efficiently and handles edge cases effectively.
