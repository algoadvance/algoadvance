[Leetcode 2068. Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2068)
## Problem Statement
We are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. The two strings are considered "almost equivalent" if the differences between the frequencies of corresponding characters in the two strings are at most 3 for all characters from 'a' to 'z'. We need to write a function to determine whether these two strings are almost equivalent.

### Example
```
Input: word1 = "aaaa", word2 = "bccb"
Output: false

Input: word1 = "abcdeef", word2 = "abaaacc"
Output: true
```

We need to implement the function `checkAlmostEquivalent(word1: string, word2: string): boolean` that returns `true` if the given words are almost equivalent and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the input string lengths?
   - Typical constraints involve length and allowed characters.
   
2. Are the strings guaranteed to have only lowercase Latin letters?
   - Yes, the problem implies we are only dealing with lowercase alphabetic characters.

3. Can either string be empty?
   - It is typical for the constraints to ensure neither string is empty, but clarifying this with the interviewer is beneficial.

## Strategy
1. **Frequency Count:** 
   - Create two frequency arrays `freq1` and `freq2` of size 26 to maintain the counts of each character from 'a' to 'z' in both `word1` and `word2`.
   
2. **Count Characters:**
   - Iterate through each character in `word1` and populate `freq1`.
   - Do the same for `word2` and populate `freq2`.
   
3. **Compare Frequencies:**
   - Compare the frequencies of corresponding characters in `freq1` and `freq2`. If the absolute difference between corresponding frequencies is greater than 3 for any character, return `false`.

4. **Return True:**
   - If no such difference greater than 3 is found, return `true`.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. This is because we are iterating through each string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the additional space used (the two arrays of size 26) is independent of the input size.

## Code
```javascript
function checkAlmostEquivalent(word1, word2) {
    const freq1 = Array(26).fill(0);
    const freq2 = Array(26).fill(0);
    
    // Populate frequency arrays
    for (let char of word1) {
        freq1[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    
    for (let char of word2) {
        freq2[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    
    // Compare frequencies
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (Math.abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]) > 3) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
In this solution, we efficiently count the occurrences of each character and compare these counts to determine if the strings meet the almost equivalent criteria.
