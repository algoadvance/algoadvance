[Leetcode 2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2163)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove `n` elements from the beginning and `n` elements from the end to get a new array consisting of `n` elements.

The **difference in sums** is defined as the **difference between the sum of the first half and the sum of the second half** of the new array.

Return the minimum difference in sums possible after performing the above operation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints and Edge Cases**: What are the constraints on the size of `nums`? Minimum and maximum values?
2. **Output**: Should the output be an absolute difference, or can it be negative?
3. **Uniqueness**: Can the integers in `nums` repeat?
4. **Time Complexity**: What is the expected time complexity?

Assuming the following constraints based on common LeetCode problem:
- `nums.length = 3 * n` and `3 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^5`
- Elements of `nums` are integer values and can be either positive or negative.

## Strategy

1. **Divide and Conquer with Priority Queues**:
    - Since we need to find the difference of sums after removing `n` elements from both ends, we'll calculate possible sums for the first and second halves separately.
    - Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) for the first half to store the smallest `n` sums.
    - Use a Max-Heap (Priority Queue) for the second half to store the largest `n` sums.
2. **Calculate Sums**:
    - Calculate the potential sums of the smallest `n` elements from the prefix.
    - Calculate the potential sums of the largest `n` elements from the suffix.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
    - Traverse through the array and dynamically adjust the sums to find the minimum difference in each half.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumDifference = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length / 3;
    
    // Helper function to create Min-Heap
    class MinHeap {
        constructor() {
            this.heap = [];
        }
        
        insert(val) {
            this.heap.push(val);
            this.bubbleUp();
        }
        
        bubbleUp() {
            let idx = this.heap.length - 1;
            while (idx > 0) {
                let parentIdx = Math.floor((idx - 1) / 2);
                if (this.heap[idx] >= this.heap[parentIdx]) break;
                [this.heap[idx], this.heap[parentIdx]] = [this.heap[parentIdx], this.heap[idx]];
                idx = parentIdx;
            }
        }
        
        extractMin() {
            if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
            const min = this.heap[0];
            this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
            this.sinkDown();
            return min;
        }
        
        sinkDown() {
            let idx = 0;
            const length = this.heap.length;
            const element = this.heap[0];
            
            while (true) {
                let leftChildIdx = 2 * idx + 1;
                let rightChildIdx = 2 * idx + 2;
                let swap = null;
                
                if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                    if (this.heap[leftChildIdx] < element) {
                        swap = leftChildIdx;
                    }
                }
                
                if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                    if ((swap === null && this.heap[rightChildIdx] < element) || (swap !== null && this.heap[rightChildIdx] < this.heap[leftChildIdx])) {
                        swap = rightChildIdx;
                    }
                }
                
                if (swap === null) break;
                [this.heap[idx], this.heap[swap]] = [this.heap[swap], this.heap[idx]];
                idx = swap;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // First half - from left to middle
    const prefixSums = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    const minHeap = new MinHeap();
    let prefixSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
        minHeap.insert(nums[i]);
    }
    prefixSums[0] = prefixSum;
    
    for (let i = n; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        minHeap.insert(nums[i]);
        prefixSum += nums[i] - minHeap.extractMin();
        prefixSums[i - n + 1] = prefixSum;
    }
    
    // Second half - from right to middle
    const suffixSums = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    const maxHeap = new MinHeap();
    let suffixSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        suffixSum += nums[3 * n - 1 - i];
        maxHeap.insert(-nums[3 * n - 1 - i]);
    }
    suffixSums[0] = suffixSum;
    
    for (let i = n; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        maxHeap.insert(-nums[3 * n - 1 - i]);
        suffixSum += nums[3 * n - 1 - i] + maxHeap.extractMin();
        suffixSums[i - n + 1] = suffixSum;
    }
    
    // Finding the minimum difference
    let minDifference = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, prefixSums[i] - suffixSums[n - i]);
    }
    
    return minDifference;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: The operations of insertion and extraction in a heap take O(log n) time.
- **Total Operations**: We perform heap operations for `2n` elements for both prefix and suffix.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n log n) is the dominating complexity due to the heap operations.

This approach ensures that the minimum difference in sums is determined efficiently.
