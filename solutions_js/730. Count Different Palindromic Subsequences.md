[Leetcode 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l730)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return _the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in_ `s`. 

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input string `s`?**
   - `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
   - `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

2. **What should be considered a different palindrome?**
   - Palindromic subsequences are considered different if they consist of different sequences of characters, even if they are the same when reversed.

3. **Should the output be the count of unique palindromic subsequences?**
   - Yes, we need to count each unique palindromic subsequence only once.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a 3D DP array where `dp[i][j][c]` represents the number of palindromic subsequences from `s[i]` to `s[j]` that starts and ends with the character `c`.

2. **Transitions**:
   - If `s[i] != 'a' + c` and `s[j] != 'a' + c`: `dp[i][j][c] = dp[i+1][j][c] + dp[i][j-1][c] - dp[i+1][j-1][c]`.
   - If `s[i] == s[j] == 'a' + c`: `dp[i][j][c] = 2 + sum(dp[i+1][j-1][k])` for all `k`.
   - For single character substrings: `dp[i][i][c] = 1` if `s[i] == 'a' + c`, otherwise 0.

3. **Final Count**:
   - Sum up all possible subsequences stored in `dp[0][n-1][c]` for all characters `c` from `0` to `25` (for 'a' to 'z').

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n^3 * 26)` due to the 3D nature and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.
- Space complexity is `O(n^2 * 26)`.

### Code

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function countPalindromicSubsequences(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => 
                new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => 
                new Array(26).fill(0)));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i][s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] = 1;
    }

    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            for (let c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                const char = String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt(0) + c);
                if (s[i] === char && s[j] === char) {
                    dp[i][j][c] = 2;
                    if (j > i+1) {
                        for (let k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                            dp[i][j][c] = (dp[i][j][c] + dp[i+1][j-1][k]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    if (s[i] !== char) dp[i][j][c] = (dp[i][j][c] + dp[i+1][j][c]) % MOD;
                    if (s[j] !== char) dp[i][j][c] = (dp[i][j][c] + dp[i][j-1][c]) % MOD;
                    if (s[i] !== char && s[j] !== char) dp[i][j][c] = (dp[i][j][c] - dp[i+1][j-1][c] + MOD) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
        result = (result + dp[0][n-1][c]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}
```

The above code builds a DP table to count the palindromic subsequences for each segment of the string and then sums up the results for the entire string. It ensures that we count each unique palindromic subsequence only once.
