[Leetcode 3070. Count Submatrices with Top](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3070)
Sure! Let's go through the problem statement, clarification questions, strategy, code, and time complexity step by step.

### Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of submatrices with the top-left component and sum of all its elements strictly less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before writing the code, let's make sure we understand the problem correctly:

1. **What values can the elements of the matrix take?**
   - The elements can be any integer, including negative integers.

2. **What is the range of `m`, `n`, and `k`?**
   - Typically, matrix problems on platforms like LeetCode have constraints like 1 <= m, n <= 1000 and -10^6 <= k <= 10^6. However, the exact constraints should be checked in the actual problem.

3. **Does the submatrix have to be square, or can it be any rectangular shape?**
   - The submatrix can be of any rectangular shape.

4. **Can we assume the input matrix is always non-empty?**
   - Yes, since `m` and `n` are given to be at least 1.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the prefix sums for the given matrix. The prefix sum helps to quickly compute the sum of any submatrix.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Top-Left Corners:**
   - For each possible top-left corner of a submatrix `(i, j)`, try to find all valid bottom-right corners `(p, q)` such that the sum of the submatrix formed by `(i, j)` and `(p, q)` is less than `k`.

3. **Sum Calculation Using Prefix Sums:**
   - Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum of submatrices in constant time.

### Code
Here's a JavaScript function that implements the above strategy:

```javascript
function countSubmatrices(mat, k) {
    let m = mat.length;
    let n = mat[0].length;

    // Step 1: Create the prefix sum matrix
    let prefixSum = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            prefixSum[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1] + prefixSum[i - 1][j] +
                              prefixSum[i][j - 1] - prefixSum[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }

    let count = 0;

    // Step 2: Iterate over all possible top-left corners
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // Step 3: Iterate over all possible bottom-right corners
            for (let p = i; p <= m; p++) {
                for (let q = j; q <= n; q++) {
                    let sum = prefixSum[p][q] - prefixSum[i - 1][q] - 
                              prefixSum[p][j - 1] + prefixSum[i - 1][j - 1];
                    if (sum < k) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let mat = [
  [1, 2, -1],
  [3, 4, 5],
  [-2, -1, 1]
];
let k = 8;
console.log(countSubmatrices(mat, k)); // Output will depend on mat and k
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution can be analyzed step-by-step:

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** This takes O(m * n) time.
- **Finding Submatrices:** We iterate over all possible top-left and bottom-right corners, leading to O((m^2) * (n^2)) complexity because for each cell, we iterate through all possible bottom-right cells.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m^2 * n^2), which could be inefficient for large matrices.

### Optimization
- This problem can potentially be optimized using more advanced techniques like **binary search** on prefix sums or using **data structures** like **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)** to speed up the sum calculations and reduce the time complexity to something more manageable.

For the given problem constraints, make sure to test and understand if the naive approach's performance is acceptable or if further optimization is needed based on input size and limits.
