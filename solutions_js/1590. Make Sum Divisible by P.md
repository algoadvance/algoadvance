[Leetcode 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1590)
### Problem Statement

**1590. Make Sum Divisible by P**

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is not allowed to remove the entire array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Removing the subarray [4] gives us the remaining sum 6, which is divisible by 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We need to remove the subarray [6,3] or [3,5].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum of the array is 6, which is already divisible by 3, so we don't need to remove anything.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there negative numbers in the array?**
   No, the array only contains positive integers.
   
2. **Is the array length constrained?**
   The length of the array can go up to 10^5.
   
3. **Is the input always such that there's a possible solution?**
   We need to check for cases where it's impossible to achieve the requirement and hence return `-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculation of Total Sum Modulo `p`**: 
   Calculate the total sum of the array and determine its modulo with `p`.

2. **Edge Case Checking**:
   If the total sum is already divisible by `p`, return 0 as no removal is necessary.

3. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map for Modulo Storage**:
   Use prefix sums to keep track of cumulative sums and store their modulo with `p` in a hash map. This allows efficient identification of subarrays that, when removed, result in the remaining sum being divisible by `p`.

4. **Find the Subarray**:
   Iterate through the array and update the hash map. Use the hash map to check the smallest subarray that, if removed, results in the desired sum condition.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - Calculating the total sum requires O(n).
   - Iterating through the array to maintain prefix sums and checking subarray removal also requires O(n).
   - Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

```javascript
var minSubarray = function(nums, p) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    const targetMod = totalSum % p;
    
    if (targetMod === 0) return 0;
    
    const prefixSumMods = new Map();
    prefixSumMods.set(0, -1);  // To handle cases where the subarray starts at index 0
    let prefixSum = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
        let modValue = prefixSum % p;
        
        let requiredMod = (modValue - targetMod + p) % p;
        
        if (prefixSumMods.has(requiredMod)) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - prefixSumMods.get(requiredMod));
        }
        
        prefixSumMods.set(modValue, i);
    }
    
    return minLength === Infinity ? -1 : minLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating Total Sum**: O(n)
- **Maintaining Prefix Sum Modulo and Lookup**: O(n)

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is optimal for this problem given the constraints on the array size.
