[Leetcode 352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l352)
## Problem Statement
Given a data stream input of integers, we need to create a class `SummaryRanges` where:
1. `SummaryRanges()` initializes the object.
2. `void addNum(int val)` adds an integer from the data stream to the data structure.
3. `int[][] getIntervals()` returns an array of disjoint intervals `[starti, endi]` covering the ranges of the numbers seen so far. The intervals should be stored in sorted order.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should the intervals be merged automatically when overlapping numbers are added?
   - **A:** Yes, intervals should be merged automatically.

2. **Q:** What should be the behavior if the same number is added multiple times?
   - **A:** Repeated additions of the same number should not change the resulting intervals.

3. **Q:** Can the `addNum` method be called multiple times with random order?
   - **A:** Yes, numbers can be added in any order.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** We initialize the object with an empty structure to store intervals.
2. **Adding a Number:**
   - Insert the number in the correct position to maintain the order.
   - Merge with existing intervals if necessary.
3. **Generating Intervals:**
   - Traverse through the structure and collect all intervals.

We'll use a sorted list to store the intervals to handle the insertion and merging efficiently.

### Detailed Steps:
1. For `addNum(int val)`:
   - Check where the `val` should be inserted in the list of intervals.
   - Merge with previous or next intervals if they overlap or touch `val`.
   
2. For `getIntervals()`:
   - Simply return the current list of merged intervals.

## Code
```javascript
class SummaryRanges {
    constructor() {
        this.intervals = [];
    }

    addNum(val) {
        if (this.intervals.length === 0) {
            this.intervals.push([val, val]);
            return;
        }
        
        let newInterval = [val, val];
        let mergedIntervals = [];
        let i = 0;
        
        // Add intervals that are completely before the new interval
        while (i < this.intervals.length && this.intervals[i][1] < val - 1) {
            mergedIntervals.push(this.intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // Merge with overlapping intervals
        while (i < this.intervals.length && this.intervals[i][0] <= val + 1) {
            newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0], this.intervals[i][0]);
            newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], this.intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        
        mergedIntervals.push(newInterval);
        
        // Add remaining intervals
        while (i < this.intervals.length) {
            mergedIntervals.push(this.intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }
        
        this.intervals = mergedIntervals;
    }

    getIntervals() {
        return this.intervals;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
### For `addNum(int val)`:
- **Best case:** O(n), where n is the number of intervals (when we need to go through all intervals).
- **Average case:** O(n), as each insertion requires merging which might involve iterating over most intervals.

### For `getIntervals()`:
- O(1), since it simply returns the list of intervals.

This solution ensures that we maintain a sorted order and properly merge overlapping intervals efficiently.
