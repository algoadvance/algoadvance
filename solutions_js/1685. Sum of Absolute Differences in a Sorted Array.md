[Leetcode 1685. Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1685)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of integers `nums`, return the sum of absolute differences between each element and the average of the array. The average of the array is the sum of all the elements divided by the length of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integers in `nums`?**
   - Usually, this can be from `-10^5` to `10^5` based on typical LeetCode problems, but we can assume they are within the practical limit of JavaScript's number type.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

3. **What is the maximum length of `nums`?**
   - Typically, this will be around `10^4` to `10^5`, but we should assume it's feasible to handle in JavaScript with efficient algorithms.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we should:

1. Compute the sum and the average of the original array.
2. For each element in the `nums` array, calculate the absolute difference between that element and the average.
3. Sum all of these absolute differences.

Detailed steps:

1. **Calculate the sum** of all elements in `nums`.
2. **Compute the average** from the sum.
3. **Iterate through `nums`**, calculate the absolute difference with the average, and accumulate these differences.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy described:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var getSumAbsoluteDifferences = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;

    // Step 1: Calculate the sum of the array
    let totalSum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

    // Step 2: Calculate the average
    let average = totalSum / n;

    // Step 3: Calculate the sum of absolute differences
    let sumOfDifferences = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        sumOfDifferences += Math.abs(num - average);
    }

    return sumOfDifferences;
};

// Example usage
console.log(getSumAbsoluteDifferences([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Example usage, output adjusted based on what the problem specifies
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because:

1. Calculating the sum of the array (step 1) takes O(n).
2. Calculating the average is O(1).
3. Iterating through the array to calculate the sum of absolute differences (step 3) takes O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
