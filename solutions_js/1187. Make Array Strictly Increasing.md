[Leetcode 1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1187)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing. In one operation, you can choose any element from `arr2` and replace it with any element in `arr1`.

- Arrays `arr1` and `arr2` are both arrays of distinct integers.
- Ensure that the elements in `arr2` can be reused multiple times.

**Example:**

```
Input: arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7], arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace 5 with 2, then arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can arr2 be used multiple times in solution?**
   - Yes, elements in arr2 can be reused.

2. **Are both arrays distinct integers?**
   - Yes, both arrays contain distinct integers.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with binary search. The steps to solve this problem are:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort `arr2` to enable binary search operations, which will help in efficiently finding the possible replacements in `arr1`.
2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the minimum changes required to make the array strictly increasing up to a certain point.
   - The state `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum changes needed to make the array strictly increasing up to the i-th element of `arr1` with `j` being the last value considered.
3. **Transitions**:
   - At each step, we can decide whether to keep the current element, replace it with an element from `arr2`, or replace a previously used element.
4. **Tracking Minimum**:
   - Track the minimum operations over all valid configurations.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation with detailed comments:

```javascript
function makeArrayIncreasing(arr1, arr2) {
    arr2.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = arr1.length;
    const dp = new Map();

    function dfs(i, prev) {
        if (i == n) return 0;
        const key = `${i},${prev}`;
        if (dp.has(key)) return dp.get(key);

        let cost = Infinity;

        // Scenario 1: Keep `arr1[i]` if it is greater than `prev`
        if (arr1[i] > prev) {
            cost = dfs(i + 1, arr1[i]);
        }

        // Scenario 2: Replace `arr1[i]` using an element from `arr2`
        let idx = binarySearch(arr2, prev);
        if (idx < arr2.length) {
            cost = Math.min(cost, 1 + dfs(i + 1, arr2[idx]));
        }

        dp.set(key, cost);
        return cost;
    }

    function binarySearch(arr, target) {
        let lo = 0, hi = arr.length;
        while (lo < hi) {
            const mid = Math.floor((lo + hi) / 2);
            if (arr[mid] <= target) lo = mid + 1;
            else hi = mid;
        }
        return lo;
    }

    const result = dfs(0, -Infinity);
    return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
}

// Example usage
console.log(makeArrayIncreasing([1,5,3,6,7], [1,3,2,4])); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot m \cdot \log m)\)
  - n: Length of `arr1`
  - m: Length of `arr2`
  - The binary search operation costs \(O(\log m)\) and is invoked n times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot m)\)
  - Due to the memoization map where we are storing states for each combination of `i` and previous element.

This approach yields an efficient solution to the problem, ensuring that we find the minimum operations needed to make the array strictly increasing.
