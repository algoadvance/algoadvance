[Leetcode 205. Isomorphic Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l205)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the strings always of the same length?
    - Yes, according to the problem definition.
2. Can the strings contain special characters or numbers?
    - The problem does not specify restrictions on characters, so we should assume any character is valid.

### Strategy
To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, we can use two hash maps (or dictionaries) to keep track of corresponding mappings of characters from `s` to `t` and `t` to `s`. We will iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously:
1. For each character pair `(char_s, char_t)` in `s` and `t`:
    - Check if `char_s` is already mapped to some character in `t`.
        - If it is, ensure that it maps to `char_t`.
        - If not, set `char_s` to map to `char_t`.
    - Similarly, check if `char_t` is already mapped to some character in `s`.
        - If it is, ensure that it maps to `char_s`.
        - If not, set `char_t` to map to `char_s`.
2. If at any point the mapping does not match, return `false`.
3. If we traverse both strings successfully without conflicts, return `true`.

### Code
```javascript
function isIsomorphic(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;

    let mapST = new Map();
    let mapTS = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let charS = s[i];
        let charT = t[i];

        // Check both mappings
        if ((mapST.has(charS) && mapST.get(charS) !== charT) ||
            (mapTS.has(charT) && mapTS.get(charT) !== charS)) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Set the mappings
        mapST.set(charS, charT);
        mapTS.set(charT, charS);
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we are iterating through the characters of the strings once. The operations inside the loop (checking and setting values in the hash maps) take constant time, O(1). Therefore, the overall complexity is linear.
