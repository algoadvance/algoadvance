[Leetcode 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2581)
### Problem Statement
Given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a directed edge from node `ai` to node `bi`. Determine the number of possible root nodes for the graph. A possible root node is any node where every other node in the graph can be reached from this root node by following the directed edges.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be cycles in the graph?
2. Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?
3. Can the graph be disconnected, with isolated nodes?
4. Are there any constraints on `n`?

### Strategy
To determine possible root nodes in a directed graph, we leverage the concept of nodes with zero-indegree (nodes with no incoming edges). Such nodes can be considered as root candidates, as no other nodes can lead into them. Therefore, for a node to be a potential root:
1. It must be reachable from any node.
2. It must have a zero in-degree.

Steps:
1. **Calculate in-degrees for all nodes**: Traverse the list of edges and count incoming edges for each node.
2. **Count nodes with zero in-degrees**: These nodes are potential root nodes.

### Code
Here's an implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function countPossibleRootNodes(n, edges) {
    // Create an array to store the in-degree of each node
    const inDegree = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Process the edges to fill the in-degree array
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        inDegree[v]++;
    }

    // Count the nodes with zero in-degree
    let rootCount = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
            rootCount++;
        }
    }

    return rootCount;
}

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const edges = [
    [1, 2],
    [2, 3],
    [4, 5],
    [5, 3]
];
console.log(countPossibleRootNodes(n, edges)); // Outputs: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Calculating in-degrees**: O(E), where E is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Counting nodes with zero in-degrees**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(N + E)**. This is efficient for the scenario given that we need to process both nodes and edges.
