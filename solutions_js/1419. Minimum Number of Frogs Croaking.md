[Leetcode 1419. Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1419)
### Problem Statement
You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the sound "croak" made by frogs. Since multiple frogs can croak simultaneously, multiple `croak` strings might be interleaved. 
You need to determine the minimum number of frogs needed to produce the given string. If the string cannot be made using standalone and fully formed `croak` strings, return -1.

The string "croakOfFrogs" will only consist of characters: `['c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k']`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input always valid in terms of being only formed by 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k'?**
   - Yes, the input will only contain characters from the set `['c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k']`.
2. **Can the string be empty, and if so, what should be the return value?**
   - If the string is empty, the return value should be 0 since no frogs are needed.

### Strategy
1. **Tracking Progress:** Maintain counters to track the number of ongoing croak sequences.
2. **Sequence Validation:** Ensure the characters appear in the specific order required to form "croak".
3. **Frog Accounting:** Use a counter to track the number of concurrent croak completions to know the minimum frogs that were croaking at the same time.

### Approach
1. Use arrays to track the count of each character in the string "croak".
2. For each character in the input string, update the respective counter.
3. Validate the sequence by ensuring 'c' must precede 'r', 'r' must precede 'o', and so on.
4. Track the maximum number of concurrent 'c' counts which reflect the minimum number of frogs needed.
5. If the counts donâ€™t properly balance out at the end, return -1.

### Code

```javascript
function minNumberOfFrogs(croakOfFrogs) {
    const counter = { c: 0, r: 0, o: 0, a: 0, k: 0 };
    let frogs = 0;
    let maxFrogs = 0;
    
    for (const char of croakOfFrogs) {
        if (char === 'c') {
            counter.c += 1;
            frogs += 1;
            maxFrogs = Math.max(maxFrogs, frogs);
        } else if (char === 'r') {
            if (counter.r >= counter.c) return -1;
            counter.r += 1;
        } else if (char === 'o') {
            if (counter.o >= counter.r) return -1;
            counter.o += 1;
        } else if (char === 'a') {
            if (counter.a >= counter.o) return -1;
            counter.a += 1;
        } else if (char === 'k') {
            if (counter.k >= counter.a) return -1;
            counter.k += 1;
            frogs -= 1;
        }
    }
    
    if (counter.c === counter.r && counter.r === counter.o && counter.o === counter.a && counter.a === counter.k) {
        return maxFrogs;
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** We process each character in the input string exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the input string.

This solution ensures that we accurately count and validate the sequence of "croak" while keeping track of the maximum number of frogs croaking concurrently.
