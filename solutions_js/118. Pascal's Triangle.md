[Leetcode 118. Pascal's Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l118)
## Problem Statement

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. In Pascal's Triangle, the element at each position is the sum of the elements directly above it. The first row is `[1]`. 

Given an integer `numRows`, generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle.

For example, given `numRows = 5`, the output should be:

```
[
     [1],
     [1, 1],
     [1, 2, 1],
     [1, 3, 2, 1],
     [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the minimum value of `numRows`? 
   - The minimum value is `1`.

2. Are we guaranteed `numRows` will be a positive integer?
   - Yes.

3. What should be returned if `numRows` is `0`?
   - You can assume it will not be `0` as per the constraints given.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a list `result` to hold the rows of Pascal's Triangle.
2. Iterate from `0` to `numRows - 1` to construct each row of the triangle.
3. For each row `i`, initialize the first element as `1`.
4. For each subsequent element in the row (from `1` to `i-1`), calculate it based on the sum of the two elements from the previous row: `result[i-1][j-1] + result[i-1][j]`.
5. Append `1` to the end of the row since the last element of each row is always `1`.
6. Append the completed row to `result`.
7. Return `result`.

## Code

```javascript
function generate(numRows) {
    if (numRows === 0) return [];
    
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
        const row = [1];
        
        for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            row[j] = result[i - 1][j - 1] + result[i - 1][j];
        }
        
        if (i > 0) {
            row.push(1);
        }
        
        result.push(row);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})\), where `n` is the number of rows (`numRows`). This simplifies to \(O(n^2)\). Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- We have one loop that runs `numRows` times.
- For each row `i`, we perform a nested iteration to construct that row.
- The sum of the lengths of all rows up to `numRows` is \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\), which is the same as the number of elements in the triangle. 

Therefore, generating each element (which involves constant-time operations) results in an \(O(n^2)\) overall complexity.
