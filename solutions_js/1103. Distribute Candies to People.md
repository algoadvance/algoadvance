[Leetcode 1103. Distribute Candies to People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1103)
## Problem Statement

We are given `candies` which is an integer representing the number of candies we have, and `num_people` which is the number of people standing in a line. We need to distribute the candies between the people in the following manner:

1. We start with the first person and give him/her 1 candy, then move to the next person and give him/her 2 candies, and so on until we run out of candies.
2. If we reach the end of the line, we start over from the beginning (i.e., return to the first person).

The task is to return an array that represents the amount of candies each person ends up with.

For example:
- Input: `candies = 7`, `num_people = 4`
- Output: `[1, 2, 3, 1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are `candies` and `num_people` guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Should we account for cases where `num_people` is greater than `candies`?
3. Is there a maximum limit for the values of `candies` or `num_people`?

Once these answers are clear, we can proceed with our strategy and solution.

## Strategy

We will use a sequential approach to distribute the candies:
1. Initialize an array `result` of size `num_people` with 0's.
2. Use a loop to distribute candies. Keep a variable `i` to track the current index in `result` and a variable `candies_to_give` to track how many candies to give in each iteration.
3. In each iteration:
    - Give `candies_to_give` candies to the current person.
    - Deduct `candies_to_give` from `candies`.
    - Move to the next person and increment `candies_to_give`.
4. If we reach the end of the array, wrap around to the beginning.

## Code

Here's how we can implement this:

```javascript
function distributeCandies(candies, num_people) {
    let result = new Array(num_people).fill(0);
    let i = 0;
    let candies_to_give = 1;

    while (candies > 0) {
        result[i % num_people] += Math.min(candies, candies_to_give);
        candies -= candies_to_give;
        i++;
        candies_to_give++;
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(distributeCandies(7, 4)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 1]
console.log(distributeCandies(10, 3)); // Output: [5, 2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\sqrt{c})\), where \(c\) is the number of candies. This is because the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}\). Solving the equation \( \frac{n^2}{2} = c \), we get \( n \approx \sqrt{2c} \). Thus, the loop runs approximately \(O(\sqrt{c})\) times.

The space complexity is \(O(p)\) for storing the result array, where \(p\) is `num_people`.
