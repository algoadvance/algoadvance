[Leetcode 97. Interleaving String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l97)
### Problem Statement

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

You may assume that all three strings contain only lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does it mean for `s3` to be an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`?**
   - `s3` is formed by interleaving the characters of `s1` and `s2` in such a way that maintains the left-to-right order of the characters from each string.

2. **Can the input strings be empty?**
   - Yes, the input strings can be empty.

3. **What is the maximum length of the input strings?**
   - The constraints typically allow up to moderate lengths (e.g., up to 100 characters), which can affect time complexity considerations.

4. **Should the function be case-sensitive?**
   - The problem statement specifies lowercase English letters, so case sensitivity is not a concern.

### Strategy

A common technique to solve this problem is using dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the possible interleavings at each step.

1. **DP Table Definition:** We'll use a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` is `true` if a string formed by the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.

2. **Initialization:** 
    - `dp[0][0]` is `true` because two empty strings can form an empty string.
    - For the first row (`dp[0][j]`), `dp[0][j]` is `true` if the first `j` characters of `s2` match the first `j` characters of `s3`.
    - For the first column (`dp[i][0]`), `dp[i][0]` is `true` if the first `i` characters of `s1` match the first `i` characters of `s3`.

3. **Filling DP Table:**
    - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, check if `dp[i-1][j]` is `true` and `s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]` or if `dp[i][j-1]` is `true` and `s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]`.

4. **Result:**
    - The value at `dp[s1.length][s2.length]` will determine if `s3` is an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n * m)` where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2` since we fill an `n x m` table. The space complexity is also `O(n * m)` for the DP table.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s1
 * @param {string} s2
 * @param {string} s3
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isInterleave = function(s1, s2, s3) {
    const n = s1.length;
    const m = s2.length;
    const k = s3.length;

    if (n + m != k) return false;

    // Create a 2D DP array
    const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => Array(m + 1).fill(false));

    dp[0][0] = true; // Both s1 and s2 are empty.

    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || (dp[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] === s3[i+j-1]);
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || (dp[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] === s3[i+j-1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][m];
};
```

This function checks if `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2` as per the strategy outlined.
