[Leetcode 886. Possible Bipartition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l886)
### Problem Statement:
Given a set of `N` people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. Given the integer `N` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [a, b]` indicates that person `a` and person `b` dislike each other, return `true` if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of `N`?**
   - `N` ranges from 1 to 2000.
   
2. **What is the range of `dislikes` array?**
   - The dislikes array can have values such that each value is a pair of integers between `1` and `N`.

3. **Can dislikes be empty?**
   - Yes, dislikes can be empty.

4. **Are the pairs in dislikes symmetric?**
   - Yes, if `[a, b]` is present it implies person `a` dislikes person `b` and hence person `b` dislikes person `a`.

### Strategy:
The problem can be transformed into a graph bipartition problem. It boils down to checking whether the graph is bipartite. Here’s the strategy:
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the people and their dislikes as a graph using an adjacency list.
   
2. **Two-Coloring for Bipartition:**
   - Try to color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to attempt to color the graph. Here, we will use BFS.

3. **Conflict Detection:**
   - If a conflict is detected during the coloring (i.e., two adjacent nodes have the same color), then it’s not possible to split the people into two groups.

### Code:
```javascript
function possibleBipartition(N, dislikes) {
    const graph = Array.from({ length: N + 1 }, () => []);
    for (const [u, v] of dislikes) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }

    const color = Array(N + 1).fill(0); // 0: uncolored, 1: color1, -1: color2

    const bfs = (start) => {
        const queue = [start];
        color[start] = 1;  // Take color 1 as starting color
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const node = queue.shift();
            for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
                if (color[neighbor] === 0) {  // If uncolored, color it with opposite color
                    color[neighbor] = -color[node];
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                } else if (color[neighbor] === color[node]) {  // If same color, conflict found
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (color[i] === 0 && !bfs(i)) { // If uncolored and bfs coloring fails
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Graph Construction:** O(E), where E is the number of edges (i.e., pairs in the dislikes array).
- **BFS Traversal:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (people, N) and E is the number of edges (dislikes).
- The total time complexity is therefore O(N + E).

### Space Complexity:
- **Graph Representation:** O(N + E) for the adjacency list.
- **Color Array and Queue space:** O(N).
- Thus, the overall space complexity is O(N + E). 

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct bipartition check for the given problem.
