[Leetcode 2211. Count Collisions on a Road](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2211)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `directions` representing the directions of cars on a road, where:
- `'L'` indicates a car moving to the left,
- `'R'` indicates a car moving to the right, and 
- `'S'` indicates a car that is stationary.

The goal is to count the number of collisions when cars meet. A collision occurs if:
1. A car moving to the right meets a stationary car or a car moving left.
2. A car moving left meets a stationary car or a car moving right.
After a collision, both involved cars become stationary.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Do collisions between cars moving in the same direction count?
   - No, collisions only occur between cars moving in opposite directions or a car moving into a stationary car.
2. What is the length of the directions string?
   - The length can vary, but we should assume a reasonable limit for interview purposes.

### Strategy
1. Traverse the `directions` string from left to right.
2. Track ongoing cars moving right and handle collisions when they meet cars moving left or stationary cars.
3. Track the numbers of collisions for cars moving left running into either stationary cars or ongoing right-moving cars.
4. Ensure that after each collision scenario we turn these cars into stationary ones which will affect subsequent calculations.

### Code
```javascript
var countCollisions = function(directions) {
    let collisions = 0;
    let i = 0;
    let n = directions.length;
    
    // Move the pointer right to handle all directions and calculate collisions.
    while (i < n) {
        if (directions[i] === 'R') {
            // Move to the next car if it is 'R'.
            let j = i + 1;
            while (j < n && directions[j] === 'R') {
                j++;
            }
            
            // Collision handling
            if (j < n && (directions[j] === 'S' || directions[j] === 'L')) {
                collisions += (j - i);
                // Collisions have just converted all 'R's in this segment to 'S'
                i = j; // Now the position is set post collision
            } else {
                i = j; // Skip to the new valid character
            }
        } else if (directions[i] === 'L') {
            // Handle left-moving cars colliding into stationary cars.
            if (i > 0 && directions[i - 1] === 'S') {
                collisions++;
            } else if (i > 0 && directions[i - 1] === 'R') {
                collisions++;
                let k = i - 1;
                // Count how many right-movers are hit until we reach stationary or start
                while (k >= 0 && directions[k] === 'R') {
                    collisions++;
                    k--;
                }
            }
            // Make this car stationary as it has collided.
            directions[i] = 'S';
            i++;
        } else {
            // If it is stationary 'S'
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    return collisions;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. The above solution traverses each character in the string once, so the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the `directions` string.
2. This is efficient as it ensures we only pass through the string linearly and handle each character based on its immediate neighbors considering possible grouped segments.
