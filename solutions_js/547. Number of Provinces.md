[Leetcode 547. Number of Provinces](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l547)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `i-th` city and the `j-th` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise. A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

Return the total number of provinces.

### Example 1:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `isConnected` have any negative numbers?
    - No, the matrix only contains `1` and `0`.
2. Are all cities within the matrix guaranteed to be connected to themselves?
    - Yes, `isConnected[i][i]` is always `1`.

## Strategy
1. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph formed by `isConnected`.
2. Initialize an array `visited` to keep track of cities that have been visited.
3. Loop through each city and use DFS to mark all reachable cities from the current city as visited.
4. Each time a new DFS starts, increment the province count.

## Code

```javascript
function findCircleNum(isConnected) {
    const n = isConnected.length;
    const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let provinceCount = 0;

    const dfs = (city) => {
        visited[city] = true;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (isConnected[city][i] === 1 && !visited[i]) {
                dfs(i);
            }
        }
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(i);
            provinceCount++;
        }
    }

    return provinceCount;
}

// Example Usage
let isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]];
console.log(findCircleNum(isConnected)); // Output: 2

isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]];
console.log(findCircleNum(isConnected)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of cities. This is due to the nested loops when initially processing the `isConnected` matrix and the depth-first search, which in the worst case visits all `n` cities for each city.
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the `visited` array and the recursive call stack used by DFS.

This approach ensures an efficient traversal of the graph using depth-first search to identify and count the number of provinces.
