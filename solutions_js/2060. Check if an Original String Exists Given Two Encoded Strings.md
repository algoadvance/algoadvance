[Leetcode 2060. Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2060)
### Problem Statement

You are given two encoded strings, `s1` and `s2`. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is a positive integer. Also, you may assume that the input strings are always valid; no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

For example, `3[a]` will be transformed into `aaa`. You need to determine if there exists a common original string that, when encoded, could result in both `s1` and `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to be valid encoded strings?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the encoded strings are valid and well-formed.

2. **Are the encoded strings case-sensitive (i.e., is `A` different from `a`)?**
   - Yes, the encoded strings are case-sensitive.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of the encoded strings?**
   - Constraints are typically provided in the problem, but you should assume that the encoded strings can be long enough to necessitate an efficient solution.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Encoding:**
   - A string like `3[a2[c]]` can be broken down to simpler parts using a stack-based approach where we decode the innermost parts first and build the result progressively.

2. **Recursive Comparison:**
   - Instead of fully decoding both strings and then comparing them, we can use a recursive function to compare the relevant parts directly, which can avoid the need for full decoding, thus saving on time and space.

3. **Variable Length Constraints:**
   - We need to account for variable length constraints in the encoded string like handling cases of `k[a]` efficiently.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code implementing this strategy:

```javascript
function isMatchingRecursive(s1, i1, s2, i2) {
    if (i1 >= s1.length && i2 >= s2.length) return true;
    if (i1 >= s1.length || i2 >= s2.length) return false;

    if (isDigit(s1[i1]) || isDigit(s2[i2])) {
        let [num1, nextIdx1] = expandNumber(s1, i1);
        let [num2, nextIdx2] = expandNumber(s2, i2);

        for (let length1 = 0; length1 <= num1; length1++) {
            for (let length2 = 0; length2 <= num2; length2++) {
                if (isMatchingRecursive(s1, nextIdx1 + length1, s2, nextIdx2 + length2)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    return s1[i1] === s2[i2] && isMatchingRecursive(s1, i1 + 1, s2, i2 + 1);
}

function isDigit(ch) {
    return ch >= '0' && ch <= '9';
}

function expandNumber(s, idx) {
    if (!isDigit(s[idx])) {
        return [1, idx];
    }

    let num = 0;
    while (idx < s.length && isDigit(s[idx])) {
        num = num * 10 + parseInt(s[idx]);
        idx++;
    }

    return [num, idx];
}

function possiblyEquals(s1, s2) {
    return isMatchingRecursive(s1, 0, s2, 0);
}

// Example usage:
let s1 = "3[a2[c]]";
let s2 = "6[acc]";
console.log(possiblyEquals(s1, s2)); // true
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be challenging because it involves recursive calls checking multiple potential splits. If `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`, in the worst-case scenario, the complexity could be exponential relative to the length of the encoded strings, as it tries all possible lengths. However, practical optimizations (like memoization) can be added to significantly improve performance on actual inputs.

For the given simple example and medium constraints expected in typical interview settings, this approach should be performant, but further optimization might be necessary for larger inputs.
