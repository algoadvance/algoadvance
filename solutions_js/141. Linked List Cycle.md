[Leetcode 141. Linked List Cycle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l141)
### Problem Statement
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos`, which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects back to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: What is the format of the linked list input?
   - The input will be a ListNode, which is a standard singly linked list node structure.
2. **Output Format**: What should be the output format?
   - The output should be a boolean value: `true` if there is a cycle, `false` otherwise.

### Strategy
To detect a cycle in a linked list, we can use Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm. This strategy involves having two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other. If there's a cycle, the fast pointer (hare) will eventually meet the slow pointer (tortoise). If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function(head) {
    if (head === null || head.next === null) {
        return false;
    }

    let slow = head;
    let fast = head.next;

    while (slow !== fast) {
        if (fast === null || fast.next === null) {
            return false;
        }
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, both pointers traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no additional space is used other than the two pointers.

This solution efficiently determines if a cycle exists in the linked list without modifying the list or using additional data structures.
