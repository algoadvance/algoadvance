[Leetcode 3161. Block Placement Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3161)
### Problem Statement

You're given a grid of dimensions `m` x `n` initially filled with zeros. You receive a list of queries `[[row1, col1], [row2, col2], ...]`, where each query contains the coordinates of a cell in the grid (1-based index). For each query, you need to place a block (set the cell value to 1) in the specified cell.

You should return a count of blocks present in this grid after all queries have been addressed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What is the range for the dimensions of the grid (m and n)?
2. **Number of Queries:** What is the maximum number of queries we need to process?
3. **Boundary Conditions:** Are the queries guaranteed to be within the grid boundaries (1 ≤ row ≤ m, 1 ≤ col ≤ n)?
4. **Duplicate Queries:** Can the same cell be queried more than once?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Initialize an `m x n` grid with all zeros.
2. **Processing Queries:** For each query, set the specified cell in the grid to 1.
3. **Counting Blocks:** Count the total number of cells with a value of 1 in the grid.

### Code

```javascript
function blockPlacementQueries(m, n, queries) {
    // Initialize the grid with zeros
    let grid = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Process each query
    for (const [row, col] of queries) {
        // Convert 1-based index to 0-based index
        const r = row - 1;
        const c = col - 1;
        // Place a block in the specified cell
        grid[r][c] = 1;
    }
    
    // Count the number of blocks
    let blockCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                blockCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return blockCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization:** Creating the grid takes O(m * n) time.
2. **Processing Queries:** Each query is processed in O(1) time, so for k queries, it’s O(k).
3. **Counting Blocks:** It takes O(m * n) time to count all blocks in the grid.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(m * n + k), where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `k` is the number of queries. 

### Example

```javascript
const m = 3, n = 4;
const queries = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [1, 2]
];

console.log(blockPlacementQueries(m, n, queries)); // Output: 2
```

In this example, the grid becomes:
```
[
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1]
]
```

After processing, there are 2 blocks placed (count of 1s).
