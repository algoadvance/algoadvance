[Leetcode 2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2981)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. A **special substring** is a substring that occurs **at least three times** in `s`.

You need to find the length of the **longest** special substring that occurs at least three times. If there is no such special substring, return `0`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "banana"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest special substring is "a", which occurs 3 times.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity:** Does the solution need to differentiate between upper and lower case letters?
   - Assuming the string is case-sensitive.

2. **Character Set:** What characters can be found in the string `s`?
   - Assuming it can contain any ASCII characters.

3. **String Length:** Is there a maximum length for the input string `s`?
   - Assuming constraints similar to typical problem statements, usually up to 10^5 characters long.

## Strategy

To find the longest substring that occurs at least three times, we can leverage binary search combined with hashing:

1. **Binary Search for Length:** We will perform a binary search on the possible lengths of the substring. This narrows down the search space efficiently.
   
2. **Rabin-Karp Hashing:** For a fixed length during each binary search iteration, we will use Rabin-Karp rolling hashing to determine if there is any substring of that length that appears at least three times. Rabin-Karp allows us to efficiently compare substrings in constant time after initial preprocessing.

3. **Collision Handling:** We will use a hash set to store the hash values and detect collisions to ensure we count exact substring occurrences.

**Steps in Detail:**
- Implement binary search on the length of the substring.
- Within the binary search, use Rabin-Karp to find all substrings of the current length.
- Check if any substring appears at least three times.

## Code

```javascript
function longestSpecialSubstring(s) {
    if (s.length < 3) return 0;
    
    // Binary search for length of the longest special substring
    let low = 1, high = s.length, result = 0;
    
    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (hasSpecialSubstringOfLength(mid, s)) {
            result = mid;
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

function hasSpecialSubstringOfLength(len, s) {
    const MOD = 1e9+7;
    const BASE = 31;
    let hash = 0;
    let baseL = 1;
    
    // Initial hash and base^(len-1)
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        hash = (hash * BASE + s.charCodeAt(i)) % MOD;
        if (i < len - 1) baseL = (baseL * BASE) % MOD;
    }
    
    const seen = new Map();
    seen.set(hash, 1);
    
    for (let i = len; i < s.length; i++) {
        // Rolling hash computation
        hash = (hash * BASE + s.charCodeAt(i) - s.charCodeAt(i - len) * baseL) % MOD;
        if (hash < 0) hash += MOD;
        
        if (seen.has(hash)) {
            seen.set(hash, seen.get(hash) + 1);
            if (seen.get(hash) >= 3) return true;
        } else {
            seen.set(hash, 1);
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(longestSpecialSubstring("banana")); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in `O(log n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Hashing (Rabin-Karp):** For each length check, the Rabin-Karp algorithm computes in `O(n)` time because we slide over the string once and compute hashes in constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which is efficient for input sizes typical in competitive programming.
