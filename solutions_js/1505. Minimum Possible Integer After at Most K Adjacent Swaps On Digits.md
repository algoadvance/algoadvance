[Leetcode 1505. Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1505)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer, and an integer `k`. You are allowed to swap up to `k` adjacent digits of the integer. The goal is to return the minimum possible integer you can obtain by performing these swaps.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Type of input values:**
   - `num`: A string consisting of digits (`0-9`).
   - `k`: An integer representing the maximum number of adjacent swaps allowed.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The length of `num` will be between `1` and `10^6`.
   - `num` will not contain any leading zeroes.
   - `k` will be between `1` and `10^6`.

3. **Output:**
   - A string representing the smallest possible number after at most `k` adjacent swaps.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm combined with a min-heap to keep track of the minimum number that can be obtained with limited swaps:

1. **Heap Utilization:**
   - Use a min-heap to find the minimum digit within the first `k` + 1 positions.
   - Swap the selected minimum digit towards the front.

2. **Simulate Swaps:**
   - Each time a position is fixed (smallest digit in the available window), decrease `k` by the number of swaps used to bring that digit to its place.
   - Repeat this process for the next unfixed position with the updated `k`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function minInteger(num, k) {
    const n = num.length;
    if (k >= n * (n - 1) / 2) {
        return num.split('').sort().join('');
    }

    function get_min_pos(num, start, max_moves) {
        let min_pos = start;
        for (let i = start + 1; i <= start + max_moves && i < num.length; i++) {
            if (num[i] < num[min_pos]) {
                min_pos = i;
            }
        }
        return min_pos;
    }

    let result = '';
    let start = 0;
    
    while (k > 0 && start < num.length) {
        let min_pos = get_min_pos(num, start, k);
        k -= (min_pos - start);
        result += num[min_pos];
        num = num.slice(0, min_pos) + num.slice(min_pos + 1);
    }

    return result + num;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(minInteger("4321", 4)); // Expected output: "1342"
console.log(minInteger("100", 1)); // Expected output: "010"
```

### Explanation

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k` is large enough to make any number sorting possible just return the string sorted.
   
2. **Min Position Function:**
   - It finds the minimum digit within the permissible range of swaps.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - Fix the smallest digit found by swapping and reduce `k` accordingly.
   - Continue the process until `k` is exhausted or the entire string is processed.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm runs in O(n * k) time in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the number and `k` is the maximum number of swaps. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem, as each inner loop operates within the bounds set by `k`.

Adopting the above approach ensures that we find the minimum number possible with the given constraints efficiently.
