[Leetcode 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1723)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the `i-th` job. There are `k` workers available. Each worker can be assigned any number of non-overlapping jobs, and a worker will finish all the assigned jobs sequentially. The working time of a worker is the sum of the time taken to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to find the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each worker one job, the maximum time is 3.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
- `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the significance of the constraint `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`?**
   - The constraint indicates the problem size may allow for more complex algorithms due to the relatively small input size.
   
2. **Should we handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the `jobs` array?**
   - The problem constraint `1 <= k <= jobs.length` implies that `k` will never be greater than the length of the `jobs` array.

3. **Are there any constraints on the time complexity?**
   - Given the problem constraints, the solution should ideally be efficient enough to handle the upper limits.

## Strategy

The problem mandates the use of an efficient assignment algorithm to minimize the maximum working time. Given the constraints, a feasible approach is to use **Binary Search** combined with **Backtracking**:
1. **Binary Search:** To minimize the maximum working time, we can use binary search on the possible range of the maximum time.
2. **Backtracking:** For a given maximum time, we can use backtracking to check if it is possible to assign the jobs such that no worker has a workload greater than the current middle value of our binary search.

## Code

```javascript
function minimumTimeRequired(jobs, k) {
    jobs.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sort jobs in descending order to optimize backtracking
    let low = Math.max(...jobs); 
    let high = jobs.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    
    const canAssign = (jobs, workers, maxTime, idx) => {
        if (idx === jobs.length) return true;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (workers[i] + jobs[idx] <= maxTime) {
                workers[i] += jobs[idx];
                if (canAssign(jobs, workers, maxTime, idx + 1)) return true;
                workers[i] -= jobs[idx];
            }
            if (workers[i] === 0) break; // Prune branches
            
        }
        return false;
    };
    
    while (low < high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        let workers = new Array(k).fill(0);
        if (canAssign(jobs, workers, mid, 0)) {
            high = mid;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return low;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Binary Search:** We perform binary search over a range from `max(jobs)` to `sum(jobs)`. This range at most has a length of `rangeSum = sum(jobs)`, giving us a complexity of \(O(\log(\text{rangeSum}))\).
3. **Backtracking:** In the worst case, backtracking will check every possible partitioning, leading to a complexity of \(O(k^n)\).

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough, especially given `k` and `n` (length of `jobs` array) are relatively small.
