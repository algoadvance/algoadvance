[Leetcode 2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2304)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid consisting of **distinct** integers in the range `[1, m * n]`. You can move to the adjacent cells in the grid (up, down, left, right).

*Note*: The movement between cells contributes a **cost** which is based on the grid values.

Write a function to find the **minimum path cost** in the grid from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, where we define the path's cost as the sum of the values of the grid cells visited along the way.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the dimensions of the grid (m x n) always guaranteed to be greater than zero?
   - Can we assume that all path values (cells in the grid) are positive?

2. **Output:** 
   - Should the function return just the cost of the minimum path, or also the path itself?

For the purpose of solving this, we'll assume typical constraints: the grid will always have positive values, m, n â‰¥ 1, and we are interested only in the minimum path cost.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming and a priority queue (min-heap) for efficiently finding the minimum cost path. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D array `cost` where `cost[i][j]` will store the minimum cost to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**
   - Use a priority queue to always extend the path with the minimum cost first.

3. **Dynamic Update:**
   - Start from the top left cell (0, 0). Push this cell into the priority queue with its value.
   - For the current cell `(i, j)` pop from the queue, consider its 4 possible neighbors (up, down, left, right) and update their costs if a cheaper path is found.

4. **Early Stopping:**
   - The algorithm can stop as soon as the bottom right corner `(m-1, n-1)` is reached to ensure the minimum cost.

### Code

```javascript
function minPathCost(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1]];

    const cost = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    const priorityQueue = [];
    
    // Push starting point into priority queue
    priorityQueue.push([grid[0][0], 0, 0]);  // [cost, row, col]
    cost[0][0] = grid[0][0];

    while (priorityQueue.length > 0) {
        priorityQueue.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
        const [current_cost, x, y] = priorityQueue.shift();
        
        if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1) {
            return current_cost;
        }
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                const new_cost = current_cost + grid[nx][ny];
                if (new_cost < cost[nx][ny]) {
                    cost[nx][ny] = new_cost;
                    priorityQueue.push([new_cost, nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return cost[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \cdot n \cdot \log(m \cdot n))\) because each cell is processed once, and updating the priority queue operations takes logarithmic time relative to the number of cells.
- The space complexity is \(O(m \cdot n)\) due to the storage of the `cost` array and the priority queue.

This method ensures we find the minimum path cost efficiently.
