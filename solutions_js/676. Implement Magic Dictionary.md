[Leetcode 676. Implement Magic Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l676)
### Problem Statement:

Implement a `MagicDictionary` class with the following functionalities:

1. `buildDict(dictionary: string[]): void` - This method builds a dictionary through a list of words.
2. `search(searchWord: string): boolean` - This method determines if you can change **exactly one** character in the `searchWord` to match any word in the dictionary.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Can the words contain uppercase letters or special characters?
   - **A**: No, assume all words consist of lowercase English letters only.
2. **Q**: What are the constraints on the length of the words?
   - **A**: Each word length will be in the range [1, 100]. The number of words in the dictionary will not exceed 1000.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Data Structure**: We will use an array to store the given dictionary of words.
2. **Exact Match Check with One Character Modify**:
   - For the `search` method, iterate through the words in our dictionary.
   - For each word in the dictionary that is the same length as the `searchWord`, check if modifying only one character can make it match the `searchWord`.
   - To do this, count the character positions at which the `searchWord` and dictionary word differ. If exactly one position is different, return `true`.
   - If no such word is found, return `false`.

### Code:

```javascript
class MagicDictionary {
    constructor() {
        this.dictionary = [];
    }
    
    buildDict(dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = dictionary;
    }
    
    search(searchWord) {
        for (let dictWord of this.dictionary) {
            if (dictWord.length === searchWord.length) {
                let diffCount = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i < dictWord.length; i++) {
                    if (dictWord[i] !== searchWord[i]) {
                        diffCount++;
                        if (diffCount > 1) break;
                    }
                }
                if (diffCount === 1) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

// Example usage:
const magicDictionary = new MagicDictionary();
magicDictionary.buildDict(["hello", "hallo", "leetcode"]);
console.log(magicDictionary.search("hello")); // Outputs: true (because "hallo" differs by exactly one character)
console.log(magicDictionary.search("hhllo")); // Outputs: true (because "hallo" differs by exactly one character)
console.log(magicDictionary.search("hell"));  // Outputs: false (no word of length 4)
console.log(magicDictionary.search("leetcoded")); // Outputs: false (no word of length 9)
```

### Time Complexity:

- **buildDict(dictionary)**: This operation is O(1) as it just assigns the input list to an instance variable and doesn't depend on the size of the input list.
- **search(searchWord)**:
  - Let `N` be the number of words in the dictionary.
  - Let `L` be the length of `searchWord`.
  - Comparisons involve looping over each word of length `L` and comparing character by character.
  - In the worst case, all words in the dictionary have to be checked, resulting in O(N * L) time complexity.

The solution is efficient for the given constraints (words count <= 1000, word length <= 100).
