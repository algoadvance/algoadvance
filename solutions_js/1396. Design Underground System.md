[Leetcode 1396. Design Underground System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1396)
## Problem Statement

Design a class to track the movements of passengers on an underground subway system. The system will have the capability to record line entries and exits of passengers, and then calculate the average travel time between stations.

Implement the `UndergroundSystem` class:

- `void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)` : A customer with ID `id`, checks in at the station `stationName` at time `t`.
- `void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)` : A customer with ID `id`, checks out from the station `stationName` at time `t`.
- `double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)` : Returns the average travel time from `startStation` to `endStation`. The average time is computed from all previous trips from `startStation` to `endStation` that have been recorded.

It is guaranteed that all queries are consistent. That is, for each customer, the check-in and check-out events are correctly matched.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple trips recorded for the same customer ID?**
   - Yes, a customer might use the system multiple times.
2. **Are the station names case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, station names are case-sensitive.
3. **How do we handle incorrect check-ins or check-outs?**
   - We assume all input is valid as specified in the problem.

## Solution Code

Here's a possible solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
class UndergroundSystem {
    constructor() {
        this.checkIns = new Map();
        this.travelTimes = new Map();
    }

    checkIn(id, stationName, t) {
        this.checkIns.set(id, { stationName, t });
    }

    checkOut(id, stationName, t) {
        const checkInData = this.checkIns.get(id);
        const travelTime = t - checkInData.t;
        const routeKey = checkInData.stationName + ':' + stationName;

        if (!this.travelTimes.has(routeKey)) {
            this.travelTimes.set(routeKey, { totalTravelTime: 0, tripCount: 0 });
        }

        const routeData = this.travelTimes.get(routeKey);
        routeData.totalTravelTime += travelTime;
        routeData.tripCount += 1;

        this.checkIns.delete(id);
    }

    getAverageTime(startStation, endStation) {
        const routeKey = startStation + ':' + endStation;
        const routeData = this.travelTimes.get(routeKey);
        return routeData.totalTravelTime / routeData.tripCount;
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Data Storage**:
   - Use a `Map` to keep track of customers' check-in details: `checkIns`.
   - Use another `Map` to store travel time data between station pairs: `travelTimes`.

2. **Check-In** (`checkIn` method):
   - When a customer checks in, store their station and time in `checkIns`.

3. **Check-Out** (`checkOut` method):
   - When a customer checks out, find their check-in data from `checkIns`.
   - Calculate the travel time and update the `travelTimes` map with the accumulated time and count of trips.

4. **Average Travel Time** (`getAverageTime` method):
   - Use the `travelTimes` map to compute and return the average travel time for the given station pair.

## Time Complexity

1. **checkIn**: `O(1)` - Inserting into a map is an average-case O(1) operation.
2. **checkOut**: `O(1)` - Accessing, updating, and deleting entries in a map are average-case O(1) operations.
3. **getAverageTime**: `O(1)` - Accessing and performing computations on a map entry are average-case O(1) operations.

Overall, the design ensures that all operations are efficient, with average-case O(1) time complexity.
