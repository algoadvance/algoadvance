## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the start and end of the intervals?
   - Are the intervals guaranteed to be at least partially sorted in any way?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return an integer value representing the count of intervals to be removed?
   - Should the non-overlapping intervals be returned, or just the count of removals?

3. **Special Cases:**
   - What should be done if there are no intervals?
   - How to handle intervals that are already non-overlapping?

With these questions in mind, let's proceed with a strategy.

## Strategy

To minimize the number of overlapping intervals to remove, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals:**
   Sort the intervals based on their end value. This way, you can ensure that you are always considering the interval that ends the earliest, which increases the likelihood of fitting subsequent intervals without overlaps.

2. **Iterate and Count:**
   Initialize a variable to keep track of the end of the last non-overlapping interval. For each interval, check if it overlaps with the last non-overlapping interval. If it does, increment the removal count; if it doesn't, update the end value to the current interval's end.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals) {
    if (!intervals.length) return 0;

    // Sort intervals based on their end time
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let count = 0; 
    let prevEnd = intervals[0][1];

    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < prevEnd) {
            // If there is an overlap
            count++;
        } else {
            // No overlap; update the end to current interval's end
            prevEnd = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Intervals:** The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals.
- **Iterating Through Intervals:** The iteration step goes through the list once, which has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Example Usage

```javascript
console.log(eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]])); // Output: 1
console.log(eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2]]));       // Output: 2
console.log(eraseOverlapIntervals([[1, 2], [2, 3]]));               // Output: 0
```

This should effectively solve the problem by ensuring the minimum number of intervals are removed to achieve non-overlapping intervals.
