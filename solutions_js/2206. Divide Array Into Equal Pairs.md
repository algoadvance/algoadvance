[Leetcode 2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2206)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers. You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that each element belongs to exactly one pair and each pair contains equal elements.

Return `true` if you can divide the array into `n` pairs, otherwise return `false`.

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
    - Output: true
- Example 2:
    - Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    - Output: false

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for the integers in the array `nums`?
2. Can the array contain negative integers, or is it strictly non-negative?
3. Is there a maximum size constraint for the array?

Considering a standard scenario with no special constraints let's proceed with the solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the frequency of each unique element in the array.
2. Check if every element has an even count.
    - If all elements have even counts, it means we can pair them up equally.
    - If any element has an odd count, it's impossible to pair them correctly.

We'll use a hash map (JavaScript object) to count the occurrences of each element efficiently.

### Code
```javascript
function divideArray(nums) {
    const frequency = {};

    // Count frequency of each number
    for (const num of nums) {
        frequency[num] = (frequency[num] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Check if all frequencies are even
    for (const count of Object.values(frequency)) {
        if (count % 2 !== 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(divideArray([3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2])); // Output: true
console.log(divideArray([1, 2, 3, 4]));       // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity
- **Counting frequencies:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- **Checking frequencies:** O(k), where `k` is the number of unique elements in `nums`.

In the worst case, `k` can be at most `n` (when all elements are unique). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity
- **Storage for frequency map:** O(k), which in the worst case can be O(n).

Thus, in terms of both time and space complexities, the solution is efficient.
