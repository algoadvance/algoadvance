[Leetcode 3153. Sum of Digit Differences of All Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3153)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums`, find the sum of absolute differences of each pair `(i, j)` such that `i < j`. In other words, for each pair `(i, j)`, where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`, calculate `|nums[i] - nums[j]|` and return the sum of all these values.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - Typical constraints would be useful (e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`).

2. **Can the numbers be negative, and what is their range?**
   - They might be within a particular range, such as `-10^5` to `10^5`.

3. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Ensuring that there is at least one element.

With these questions in mind, but assuming an average constraint:

## Strategy
1. **Nested Loop Approach**: Iterate through each pair `(i, j)` using nested loops and calculate `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`. While this has `O(n^2)` time complexity, it is straightforward.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Sorting**:
   - Sort the array `nums`.
   - Calculate the difference contributions for all pairs using arithmetic properties and the prefix sums.
   - A more analytical approach can reveal avoiding explicit pair evaluation by leveraging sorted order properties.

## Code
Here's the implementation of the nested loop approach:

```javascript
function sumOfDifferences(nums) {
    let totalSum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            totalSum += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]);
        }
    }
    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sumOfDifferences(nums));  // Output: 4 (|1-2| + |1-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 2 + 1)
```

## Optimized Code with Sorting
```javascript
function sumOfDifferences(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let totalSum = 0;
    let prefixSum = [0];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefixSum.push(prefixSum[i] + nums[i]);
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        totalSum += nums[i] * (i) - prefixSum[i];
        totalSum += (prefixSum[nums.length] - prefixSum[i+1]) - nums[i] * (nums.length - i - 1);
    }
    
    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sumOfDifferences(nums));  // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Nested Loop Approach**: `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the array. This is manageable for smaller arrays but may be impractical for larger arrays.
2. **Optimized Sorting Approach**: 
   - Sorting: `O(n log n)`
   - Calculating prefix sums and contributions: `O(n)`
   - Overall: `O(n log n)`

The optimized approach is efficient and suitable for larger input sizes, whereas the nested loop approach is simpler but less efficient for large arrays.

Use these methods depending on the input size and performance needs.
