[Leetcode 2301. Match Substring After Replacement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2301)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings s and sub. You are also given a 2D character array mappings where `mappings[i] = [old_i, new_i]` indicates that you may perform the following operation any number of times:

- Replace a character `old_i` in s with `new_i`.

Each character in `s` may be replaced zero or more times using any of the available mappings.

Return true if it is possible to make `sub` a substring of `s` after performing any number of replacements on `s`, otherwise, return false.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `s` and `sub` be empty strings?**
    - We assume that s and sub are non-empty strings.

2. **Is there any limitation on the size of `mappings`?**
    - No specific limitation, but we assume it does not exceed reasonable memory usage.

3. **Is the mapping always one-to-one?**
    - No, the same character in `s` can be replaced by any character in multiple mappings.

4. **Can the same character in `sub` appear multiple times in `mappings`?**
    - Yes, and each instance should be considered valid for any substitution.

### Strategy

1. **Create a mapping table:** Use a Map to track all possible replacements for each character in `s`.
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Slide a window the size of `sub` over `s` and check if each substring of `s` matches `sub`, taking possible replacements into consideration.
3. **Replacement Validation:** For each position in `s`'s substring, check if the character matches the corresponding character in `sub`, either directly or through a valid replacement.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} sub
 * @param {character[][]} mappings
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var matchReplacement = function(s, sub, mappings) {
    const replacementMap = new Map();

    // Construct the mapping table from mappings
    mappings.forEach(([oldChar, newChar]) => {
        if (!replacementMap.has(oldChar)) {
            replacementMap.set(oldChar, new Set());
        }
        replacementMap.get(oldChar).add(newChar);
    });

    const canMatch = (sChunk, sub) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < sub.length; i++) {
            if (sChunk[i] === sub[i]) continue; // direct match
            if (replacementMap.has(sChunk[i]) && replacementMap.get(sChunk[i]).has(sub[i])) continue; // valid replacement
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    // Slide over s to check each possible substring
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - sub.length; i++) {
        const sChunk = s.substring(i, i + sub.length);
        if (canMatch(sChunk, sub)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

// Example Usage
const s = "fool3e7bar";
const sub = "leet";
const mappings = [["e", "3"], ["t", "7"], ["t", "8"]];
console.log(matchReplacement(s, sub, mappings)); // Output should be true
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Mapping Table Creation:** O(m) where m is the number of mappings.
2. **Sliding Window:** O(n * k) where n is the length of `s` and k is the length of `sub`.
3. **Total Time Complexity:** O(m + n * k).

This solution efficiently checks all possible substrings while honoring potential replacements defined in mappings, ensuring correctness in polynomial time.
