[Leetcode 942. DI String Match](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l942)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains only the characters `'I'` (for "increase") and `'D'` (for "decrease"). Here's what you need to do:
- Write a function `diStringMatch` that returns an array of integers `perm`. The length of `perm` should be `n+1` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- The array `perm` should be a permutation of the integers from `0` to `n` such that:
  - For every `'I'` at position `i` in `s`, `perm[i] < perm[i+1]`
  - For every `'D'` at position `i` in `s`, `perm[i] > perm[i+1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of lengths for the input string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` can be anything from 1 to 10,000.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` will only contain the characters 'I' and 'D'.

## Code

```javascript
function diStringMatch(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let low = 0, high = n;
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === 'I') {
            result.push(low);
            low++;
        } else if (s[i] === 'D') {
            result.push(high);
            high--;
        }
    }

    // Append the last remaining value
    result.push(low); // low and high should be equal here
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(diStringMatch("IDID")); // Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
console.log(diStringMatch("III"));  // Output: [0,1,2,3]
console.log(diStringMatch("DDI"));  // Output: [3,2,0,1]
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n` respectively, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - For every 'I' in the string, append the current value of `low` to the resulting array and increment `low`.
   - For every 'D' in the string, append the current value of `high` to the resulting array and decrement `high`.

3. **Final Step:**
   - After the iteration, append the remaining value (which will be the same for both `low` and `high`) to the resulting array.

This strategy ensures that we get the correct permutation as per the problem requirements.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We only loop through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. The result array will have `n+1` elements.

This approach is efficient and meets the constraints provided in the problem statement.
