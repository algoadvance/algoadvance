[Leetcode 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l744)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters, and a target letter `target`, find the smallest element in the list that is greater than the given target. Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is `'z'` and `letters` is `['a', 'b']`, the answer would be `'a'`.

You may assume the letters array will always have at least 2 different characters.

### Example
- Example 1:
    ```
    Input: letters = ["c", "f", "j"], target = "a"
    Output: "c"
    ```
- Example 2:
    ```
    Input: letters = ["c", "f", "j"], target = "c"
    Output: "f"
    ```
- Example 3:
    ```
    Input: letters = ["c", "f", "j"], target = "d"
    Output: "f"
    ```

### Constraints
- `2 <= letters.length <= 10^4`
- `letters[i]` is a lowercase letter.
- `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the input always consist of lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the input will always be lowercase letters.
2. Is it guaranteed that `letters` is always sorted?
   - Yes, `letters` is always sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. Do we need to handle the wrap-around case where the next character after 'z' is 'a'?
   - Yes, wrap-around is necessary for characters comparison.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use binary search for an efficient solution:
1. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = letters.length - 1`.
2. Perform binary search:
    - Calculate `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
    - If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to the target, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - If `letters[mid]` is greater than the target, move `right` to `mid`.
3. After exiting the loop, `left` will have the smallest index where `letters[left]` is greater than the target.
4. If `left` does not point to a valid index within the array bounds, it means all elements are less than or equal to target, so we wrap around and return `letters[0]`.

## Code

```javascript
function nextGreatestLetter(letters, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = letters.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

        if (letters[mid] <= target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    // If all elements are less than or equal to target
    if (letters[left] <= target) {
        return letters[0];
    }

    return letters[left];
}

// Example usage:
// const letters = ["c", "f", "j"];
// const target = "a";
// console.log(nextGreatestLetter(letters, target)); // Output: "c"
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `letters` array. This is due to the binary search operation.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we're using a constant amount of additional space.
