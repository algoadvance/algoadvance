[Leetcode 1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1143)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, “ace” is a subsequence of “abcde”.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum lengths of `text1` and `text2`?
   - Are the inputs guaranteed to be non-null and valid strings?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should we return the longest common subsequence itself or just its length?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle empty strings?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we'll employ a dynamic programming approach. 

### Steps

1. **Define a DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `text1[0...i-1]` and `text2[0...j-1]`.

2. **Initialize the Table:**
   - The size of the table will be `(n+1) x (m+1)` where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`, respectively.
   - Initialize the first row and the first column with zeros since a sequence compared to an empty sequence has zero common subsequences.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For each character `text1[i-1]` and `text2[j-1]`:
     - If they are equal, it means we can extend the common subsequence found so far by 1, hence `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
     - If they are not equal, we take the maximum value from either `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]`.

4. **Extract the Result:**
   - The value in `dp[n][m]` will give the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1` and `text2`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n * m)` where `n` is the length of `text1` and `m` is the length of `text2` because we need to fill a table of size `(n+1) x (m+1)`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also `O(n * m)` due to the storage required for the DP table.

## Code

```javascript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2) {
    const n = text1.length;
    const m = text2.length;
    
    // DP table initialization
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(m + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The length of the longest common subsequence
    return dp[n][m];
}

// Example usage
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abcde", "ace")); // Output: 3 ("ace")
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "abc")); // Output: 3 ("abc")
console.log(longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "def")); // Output: 0 (No common subsequence)
```

This implementation will compute the longest common subsequence length efficiently using dynamic programming.
