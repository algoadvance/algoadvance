[Leetcode 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1052)
### Problem Statement

Let's define the problem statement as provided by LeetCode 1052 - Grumpy Bookstore Owner:

There's a bookstore owner who is sometimes grumpy. When the owner is grumpy, the customers who visit the store during that time do not make a purchase. However, the owner can use a special technique to keep themselves happy for `X` minutes straight, during which all customers make purchases regardless of the owner's normal demeanor during that period.

Given two integer arrays:
- `customers` where `customers[i]` is the number of customers at the `i-th` minute.
- `grumpy` where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the `i-th` minute, and `0` otherwise.

You are also given an integer `X`, which is the maximum number of consecutive minutes the owner can use the secret technique.

Your task is to figure out the maximum number of customers that can make a purchase if the owner chooses to use the technique optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `X` be greater than the length of the `customers` array? No, `X` will be between 1 and the length of the `customers` array.
2. What are the lengths and constraints of the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays? Both arrays will have the same length, and both arrays will have values between 1 and 20000.
3. Are the values in the `customers` array always non-negative and in the `grumpy` array always binary (0 or 1)? Yes, `customers[i]` â‰¥ 0, and `grumpy[i]` is always 0 or 1.

### Code

Let's write the JavaScript function to solve this problem.

```javascript
var maxSatisfied = function(customers, grumpy, X) {
    const n = customers.length;
    
    // Calculate the initial number of satisfied customers without the secret technique
    let satisfiedCustomers = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] === 0) {
            satisfiedCustomers += customers[i];
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied using the secret technique
    let additionalCustomers = 0;
    let maxAdditionalCustomers = 0;
    
    // Use a sliding window approach to find the max additional customers that can be satisfied in any X-minute window
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Add the current minute's customers if the owner is grumpy
        if (grumpy[i] === 1) {
            additionalCustomers += customers[i];
        }
        
        // If the window exceeds size X, subtract the starting minute of the window if the owner was grumpy
        if (i >= X) {
            if (grumpy[i - X] === 1) {
                additionalCustomers -= customers[i - X];
            }
        }
        
        // Update max additional customers
        maxAdditionalCustomers = Math.max(maxAdditionalCustomers, additionalCustomers);
    }
    
    return satisfiedCustomers + maxAdditionalCustomers;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxSatisfied([1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], 3)); // Output: 16
```

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Baseline Satisfied Customers:** First, calculate the number of satisfied customers without using the secret technique by summing customers where `grumpy[i]` is `0`.
2. **Sliding Window for Maximum Additional Customers:** Use a sliding window of size `X` to determine the maximal number of additional customers that can be satisfied by using the technique during the grumpy periods.
3. **Adjust for Window Size:** As the window slides, add the new end customer count if the owner is grumpy and subtract the start customer count when the window moves beyond size `X`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `customers` array. This efficiency is achieved through the single pass needed to calculate the initial satisfied customers and another pass to apply the sliding window technique to find the maximal additional customers.
