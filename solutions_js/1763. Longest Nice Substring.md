[Leetcode 1763. Longest Nice Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1763)
### Problem Statement
A string `s` is considered nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is considered nice because 'a' and 'A' both appear, and 'b' and 'B' both appear as well. 

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring that occurs first. If there are none, return an empty string.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"

Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"

Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input string contain non-alphabetic characters?**
   - No, the problem explicitly deals with alphabetic characters only (both uppercase and lowercase).
   
2. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - The problem statement does not specify this, but typically problems assume non-empty input unless stated otherwise. We will handle the empty case to be comprehensive.

### Strategy
1. **Base Case:** If the string is empty or has only one character, immediately return an empty string since it cannot be nice.
   
2. **Recursive Approach:** Used to handle the problem in a partition-wise manner:
   - Split the string at each point where it fails the "niceness" condition (i.e., where a character's corresponding opposite case doesn't exist). This creates left and right subparts.
   - Recursively check for the longest nice substring in both the left and right subparts.
   - Choose the longer substring from the results of these recursive calls.

### Code
```javascript
function longestNiceSubstring(s) {
    // Helper function to check if a given substring is nice
    function isNice(substr) {
        let lowerSet = new Set();
        let upperSet = new Set();

        for (let char of substr) {
            if (char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') {
                lowerSet.add(char);
            } else if (char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z') {
                upperSet.add(char);
            }
        }
        
        for (let char of lowerSet) {
            if (!upperSet.has(char.toUpperCase())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        for (let char of upperSet) {
            if (!lowerSet.has(char.toLowerCase())) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    // Main function to be called recursively
    function findLongestNiceSubstring(s) {
        let n = s.length;
        if (n < 2) return "";
        
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the character at i has both upper and lower cases in the string
            if (s.includes(s[i].toLowerCase()) && s.includes(s[i].toUpperCase())) {
                continue;
            }
            
            let left = findLongestNiceSubstring(s.slice(0, i));
            let right = findLongestNiceSubstring(s.slice(i + 1));
            
            return left.length >= right.length ? left : right;
        }
        
        // If no bad character was found, then the whole string is nice
        return s;
    }
    
    return findLongestNiceSubstring(s);
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(longestNiceSubstring("YazaAay")); // Output: "aAa"
console.log(longestNiceSubstring("Bb")); // Output: "Bb"
console.log(longestNiceSubstring("c")); // Output: ""
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, the function might split the string at every character, making recursive calls. This can be thought of as \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string. Each recursive step reduces the problem size but can still involve string slicing operations which are \( O(n) \).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the recursion stack depth being proportional to the size of the input string, and additional space complexities due to substring creation during each call.
