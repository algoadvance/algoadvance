[Leetcode 832. Flipping an Image](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l832)
## Problem Statement

The problem, "Flipping an Image", requires you to take a binary matrix (a matrix where each element is either 0 or 1) and perform two operations on this matrix:

1. **Horizontal Flip**: Every row of the matrix is reversed.
2. **Invert**: Every 0 is replaced by 1, and every 1 is replaced by 0.

Given the binary matrix, you need to return the matrix after performing the above operations.

### Example

Input: 
```javascript
[[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
```
Output: 
```javascript
[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of dimensions for the input matrix?
   - Can the matrix be empty?

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the output be a new matrix or can it be in place?

For now, we assume the following based on typical constraints:
- The input matrix dimensions are `n x m` with `1 <= n, m <= 20`.
- The matrix is not empty.
- We need to modify the matrix in place if possible.

## Strategy

The solution includes two main steps:

1. **Horizontal Flip**: Reverse each row.
2. **Invert**: Replace all 0s with 1s and all 1s with 0s.

We can achieve this in a single pass over the matrix:

- For each row, reverse it.
- While reversing, invert each element simultaneously.

This approach involves iterating over each element once.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript function implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
var flipAndInvertImage = function(image) {
    for (let i = 0; i < image.length; i++) {
        let start = 0;
        let end = image[i].length - 1;
        
        // Reverse and invert the row
        while (start <= end) {
            if (start === end) {
                image[i][start] = image[i][start] === 1 ? 0 : 1;
            } else {
                // Swap and invert the start and end elements
                [image[i][start], image[i][end]] = [image[i][end] === 1 ? 0 : 1, image[i][start] === 1 ? 0 : 1];
            }
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    return image;
};

// Example usage:
let image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]];
console.log(flipAndInvertImage(image)); // Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Outer Loop**: Traverse each row in the matrix.
2. **Inner Loop**:
   - Initialize `start` at the beginning of the row and `end` at the end of the row.
   - Continue swapping and inverting elements while `start <= end`.
   - If `start` equals `end`, invert the middle element.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`
  - We traverse each element of the matrix exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The in-place operations use constant extra space.

This solution efficiently performs the required operations on the given matrix.
