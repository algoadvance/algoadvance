[Leetcode 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l416)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array `nums` containing only positive integers, determine if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements of the array positive integers?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that the array contains only positive integers.
   
2. **If there's only one element in the array, what should the output be?**
   - The output should be `false` because you cannot partition one element into two equal subsets.

3. **Can the array contain repeated elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain repeated elements, as there are no constraints regarding unique elements.

## Strategy

Given that the sum of the elements in the array should be equal in both subsets, the problem transforms into a problem of finding a subset with a sum equal to `totalSum / 2` if `totalSum` is even.

1. **Check for feasibility**:
    - Compute the total sum of the given array.
    - If the total sum is odd, return `false` immediately because it is impossible to split an odd number into two equal integers.

2. **Subset Sum Problem**:
    - Determine if there is a subset of the array with sum equal to `totalSum / 2` using Dynamic Programming.
    - Use a 0/1 Knapsack-like approach where we track possible sums using a boolean array `dp` where `dp[j]` indicates whether a sum `j` can be achieved using elements from the array.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
    - Initialize a boolean array `dp` of size `target + 1` (where `target = totalSum / 2`) with `dp[0] = true` because a sum of 0 can always be achieved (by choosing no elements).
    - Iterate over each number in the array and update the `dp` array in reverse order to prevent overwriting values needed for the current iteration.

## Code

```javascript
function canPartition(nums) {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    
    // If the total sum is odd, it can't be partitioned into equal subsets
    if (totalSum % 2 !== 0) return false;

    const target = totalSum / 2;
    const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;

    for (const num of nums) {
        for (let j = target; j >= num; j--) {
            dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - num];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[target];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is `O(n * target)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array and `target` is `totalSum / 2`.
- The space complexity is `O(target)` due to the use of an additional array `dp` of size `target + 1`.

By utilizing dynamic programming, we efficiently determine if a subset with the required sum exists, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and within the constraints provided.
