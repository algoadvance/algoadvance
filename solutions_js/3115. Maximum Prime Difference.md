[Leetcode 3115. Maximum Prime Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3115)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum difference between two prime numbers in the array. If the array does not contain at least two prime numbers, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the size of the input array `nums`? This can help us determine the feasibility of certain algorithms.
2. **Value Range**: What is the range of values that elements in the array `nums` can take? Knowing this will help optimize the prime-checking logic.
3. **Duplicates**: Can the array contain duplicate numbers, and if so, does it affect the result?
4. **Edge Cases**: What should be the behavior if the array has no prime numbers or only one prime number? Should we explicitly handle these cases?

Assuming reasonable constraints and that we've covered these edge cases:

## Strategy

1. **Prime Check Helper Function**: Implement a utility function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Filter Primes**: Iterate through the array and collect all prime numbers into a separate list.
3. **Calculate Differences**: If the list of prime numbers has fewer than two elements, return 0. Otherwise, calculate the maximum difference between the primes.

## Code

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Helper function to check if a number is prime
function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num === 2) return true; // 2 is the only even prime number
    if (num % 2 === 0) return false;
    for (let i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i += 2) {
        if (num % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Main function to find the maximum prime difference
function maximumPrimeDifference(nums) {
    // Collect all prime numbers in the array
    let primes = nums.filter(isPrime);

    // If there are fewer than two primes, return 0
    if (primes.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Sort the prime numbers to easily find the max and min
    primes.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Maximum difference will be between the smallest and largest primes
    return primes[primes.length - 1] - primes[0];
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(maximumPrimeDifference([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 4, 6])); // Output: 10 (11 - 1)
console.log(maximumPrimeDifference([10, 12, 14, 15])); // Output: 0 (no primes)
console.log(maximumPrimeDifference([2, 2, 2, 2])); // Output: 0 (only one unique prime)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Prime Checking**: Each call to `isPrime` takes \(O(\sqrt{n})\), where `n` is the number being checked.
- **Filtering Primes**: Filtering through `nums` thus takes \(O(n \sqrt{m})\) where `n` is the length of the array and `m` is the maximum value of the elements.
- **Sorting Primes**: Sorting the array of primes, if there are `k` primes, takes \(O(k \log k)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \sqrt{m} + k \log k)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `m` is the maximum value in the array.
