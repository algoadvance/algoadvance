[Leetcode 2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2070)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `items`, where `items[i] = [pricei, beautyi]` represents the price and beauty of an item respectively.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array `queries`. For each query, determine the maximum beauty of an item with a price less than or equal to `queries[i]`. If no such item exists, return 0.

Implement a function `maximumBeauty(items, queries)` which returns an array where the `ith` element is the answer to the `ith` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the price and beauty of the items guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **How large are the `items` and `queries` arrays expected to be?**
   - `items.length` and `queries.length` can each go up to 10^5.
   
3. **Are the entries in `queries` guaranteed to be within any specific range?**
   - Each entry in `queries` will be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Items by Price**: We will first sort the `items` array by `price`. This will help us in scanning through the items and recording cumulative maximum beauty values up to the current price.

2. **Sort Queries with Their Original Indices**: To record the original indices of the queries, we will pair each query with its index and then sort these pairs by the query values. Sorting helps us efficiently match each query with appropriate items in increasing order of price.

3. **Sweeping Items for Maximum Beauty**: Initialize a result array and a variable to keep track of the maximum beauty seen so far. As we iterate through the sorted queries, we will iterate through the sorted items to update the maximum beauty seen up to the current query price.

4. **Binary Search Optimization**: To improve efficiency, we can use a binary search to find items that can match the query. However, in this solution, the linear approach works within the constraints due to inherent sorted orders of both items and queries.

5. **Build the Result**: For each query, determine the maximum beauty available up to the maximum price of that query and store this in the result.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumBeauty(items, queries) {
    // Step 1: Sort items by price
    items.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Step 2: Pair queries with their original indices and sort by query values
    let indexedQueries = queries.map((q, i) => [q, i]);
    indexedQueries.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Step 3: Initialize result array and a variable to keep track of maximum beauty
    let result = new Array(queries.length).fill(0);
    let maxBeauty = 0;
    let j = 0;

    // Step 4: Process each query using the sorted items
    for (let [queryPrice, originalIndex] of indexedQueries) {
        // Update maxBeauty for all items with price <= current queryPrice
        while (j < items.length && items[j][0] <= queryPrice) {
            maxBeauty = Math.max(maxBeauty, items[j][1]);
            j++;
        }
        
        // Record the maximum beauty for this query
        result[originalIndex] = maxBeauty;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting `items`**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the `items` array.
2. **Sorting `queries`**: \(O(M \log M)\), where \(M\) is the length of the `queries` array.
3. **Processing Queries and Items**: \(O(N + M)\), since we are linearly iterating through items and queries in a double sweep manner.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N \log N + M \log M)\), which is efficient for the given constraints.
