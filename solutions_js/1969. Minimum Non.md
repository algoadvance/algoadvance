[Leetcode 1969. Minimum Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1969)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer p. Consider an array `nums` that contains integers from `1` to `2^p - 1` (inclusive, in ascending order). You need to find the minimum non-zero product of the array elements after performing any number of operations. In each operation, you can select any two elements of the array and multiply them together, then replace one of the selected elements with their product modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Return the minimum non-zero product of the array elements after performing the operations any number of times.

### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq p \leq 60\)

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What value should the product be taken modulo?
   - **A**: The product should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Q**: How large can the array get?
   - **A**: The array will have \(2^p - 1\) elements. When \(p = 60\), the size is \(2^{60} - 1\), which is a very large number.

3. **Q**: Do the intermediate results also need to handle large values?
   - **A**: Yes, we need to take care of intermediate values to ensure they are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow and maintain efficiency.

## Strategy
### Insight and Plan
Given that p can be as large as 60, directly computing the product of even small subsets of elements can easily lead to extremely large numbers. Consequently, using modular arithmetic will be crucial.

To minimize the result:
1. Notice that the array has elements from `1` to `2^p - 1`.
2. The largest value \(2^p - 1\) should pair with the smallest values to minimize the overall product.

### Steps:
1. Identify the two largest elements: `2^p - 2` and `2^p - 1`.
2. Compute the product \( (2^p - 2) \) raised to the power of \(2^p - 2\).
3. Multiply this by \( 2^p - 1 \).
4. Ensure to take the mod \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to handle large values.

### Code
```javascript
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

function powerMod(base, exp, mod) {
    let result = 1;
    base = base % mod;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        exp = Math.floor(exp / 2);
        base = (base * base) % mod;
    }
    return result;
}

function minNonZeroProduct(p) {
    if (p === 1) return 1;

    const maxElement = (1n << BigInt(p)) - 1n;  // 2^p - 1
    const secondMaxElement = maxElement - 1n;  // 2^p - 2
    const value = powerMod(secondMaxElement, Number(maxElement / 2n), MOD);

    return Number((value * maxElement) % BigInt(MOD));
}

console.log(minNonZeroProduct(1)); // Expected output: 1
console.log(minNonZeroProduct(2)); // Expected output: 6
console.log(minNonZeroProduct(3)); // Expected output: 1512
```

## Time Complexity
- The powerMod function is \(O(\log n)\) where `n` is the exponent, which in this case can go up to \(2^p - 2\). So, the function performs in \(O(\log(2^p - 2))\).
- The overall complexity can be considered efficient \(O(\log(p \cdot 2^{p-1}))\) for the given constraints.

This approach ensures that we effectively handle large numbers due to the constraints and provide an optimized solution.
