[Leetcode 475. Heaters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l475)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `houses` representing the positions of houses on a horizontal line, and an array `heaters` representing the positions of heaters on a horizontal line. You need to find the minimum radius such that every house can be warmed by at least one heater.

More formally, return the minimum radius `r` such that every house `h` in `houses` has access to a heater within distance `r` (i.e., |h - heater| â‰¤ r).

### Example

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1

Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1

Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can houses and heaters arrays be of different lengths?
   - Yes, they can.
   
2. Are the positions in the `houses` and `heaters` arrays guaranteed to be in sorted order?
   - No, they are not guaranteed to be sorted.

### Strategy 

1. **Sort both arrays**: Start by sorting both the `houses` and `heaters` arrays. This will help efficiently find the closest heater for each house.
   
2. **Binary Search**: For each house, use binary search to find the position of the nearest heater. This can be done using a helper function to locate the closest heater quickly.
   
3. **Calculate Radius**: For each house, calculate the distance to the closest heater and find the maximum of these distances, which will be the required radius.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to execute the strategy explained:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} houses
 * @param {number[]} heaters
 * @return {number}
 */
function findRadius(houses, heaters) {
  // Sort houses and heaters
  houses.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  heaters.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  function findClosestHeater(house) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = heaters.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
      let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (heaters[mid] < house) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid;
      }
    }

    // At this point, 'left' should be the position of the closest heater.
    // We need to check both heaters[left] and heaters[left-1] as potential closest heaters.
    let dist1 = Math.abs(heaters[left] - house);
    let dist2 = left > 0 ? Math.abs(heaters[left - 1] - house) : Infinity;

    return Math.min(dist1, dist2);
  }

  let minRadius = 0;

  // For each house, find the minimum distance to a heater and track the maximum of these distances
  for (let house of houses) {
    let closestDistance = findClosestHeater(house);
    minRadius = Math.max(minRadius, closestDistance);
  }

  return minRadius;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findRadius([1, 2, 3], [2])); // 1
console.log(findRadius([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4])); // 1
console.log(findRadius([1, 5], [2])); // 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `houses` and `heaters` arrays takes \(O(N \log N + M \log M)\), where \(N\) is the number of houses and \(M\) is the number of heaters.
- **Binary Search for Each House**: Each binary search takes \(O(\log M)\), and we perform this for each house, giving a total of \(O(N \log M)\).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O((N + M) \log N + N \log M)\). In most cases, this will be dominated by the sorting step, so it simplifies to \(O((N + M) \log \max(N, M))\).
