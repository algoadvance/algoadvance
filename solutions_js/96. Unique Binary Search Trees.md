[Leetcode 96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l96)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BST) that store values `1` to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does structurally unique mean?**
   - Structurally unique means that no two BSTs should have the same structure. The shape of the trees must be different, even if they have the same values in the nodes.
   
2. **Does the order of insertion affect the number of unique trees?**
   - No, the order of inserting nodes doesn't affect the unique structure count. We are considering all possible ways of structuring the nodes.

3. **Are there constraints on the input value `n`?**
   - Yes, typically in a LeetCode problem the constraints will ensure that `n` is a relatively small positive integer, e.g., `1 <= n <= 19`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use **dynamic programming**. The key idea is to understand that the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes is related to the number of unique BSTs with fewer nodes. 

Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes. 

The relationship can be expressed using the concept of Catalan numbers:
- For each possible root `j` (where `1 <= j <= i`), the number of trees formed with `j` as the root is the product of the number of trees formed by nodes less than `j` (i.e., `j-1` nodes) and the number of trees formed by nodes greater than `j` (i.e., `i-j` nodes).

Thus, the recursive relation is:
\[ dp[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} dp[j-1] \times dp[i-j] \]

### Code
Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem using dynamic programming:

```javascript
var numTrees = function(n) {
    // Initialize dp array with zeros and set the base case
    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    // Build the dp array
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j];
        }
    }

    // The answer is the number of unique BSTs with n nodes
    return dp[n];
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \( O(n^2) \) because:
- There is an outer loop that runs `n` times (from `1` to `n`).
- Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that runs up to `i` times in the worst scenario.
  Therefore, the nested loops contribute to the quadratic time complexity.

The space complexity is \( O(n) \) because we are using a single array `dp` of size `n + 1`.

### Summary
- We used dynamic programming to solve the problem.
- Defined a relationship to recursively calculate the number of unique BSTs.
- Implemented the solution in a time-efficient manner with \( O(n^2) \) complexity.
