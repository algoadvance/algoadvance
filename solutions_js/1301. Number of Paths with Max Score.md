### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1301: Number of Paths with Max Score

You are given a square board of characters. You can move on the board starting at the bottom-right corner marked with the character 'S'. You need to reach the top-left corner marked with the character 'E'. You can only move left, up, or diagonally to the upper-left.

The board contains digits from '0' to '9' representing the points you can collect. There may also be obstacles marked as 'X' which you cannot traverse.

Your task is to return a list of two integers:
1. The maximum score you can get by starting at 'S' and reaching 'E'.
2. The number of such paths that yield the maximum score.

Since the answer can be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the board?**
   - The board is given as an array of strings, where each string represents a row.

2. **Can you clarify the definition of "number of paths"?**
   - It refers to the ways to reach the maximum score from 'S' to 'E' following the movement rules.

3. **How big can the board be?**
   - The dimensions of the board are n x n, where 1 <= n <= 100.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Memoization Arrays:**
   - `dp[i][j]`: Tracks the maximum score attainable for each cell.
   - `paths[i][j]`: Tracks the number of ways to achieve the maximum score for each cell.

2. **Starting Point:**
   - Initialize `dp[n-1][n-1] = 0` and `paths[n-1][n-1] = 1`.

3. **Iterate from Bottom-Right to Top-Left:**
   - For each cell, determine the maximum score by checking the cells it can move from (left, up, upper-left).

4. **Update the DP and Paths Arrays:**
   - If the score matches the current maximum, accumulate the paths count.
   - If a new max score is found, update that and reset the paths count.

5. **Return Result:**
   - The value at `dp[0][0]` and `paths[0][0]` gives the desired results.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to iterating through each cell once and performing constant-time updates based on adjacent cells.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

var pathsWithMaxScore = function(board) {
    const n = board.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    const paths = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    dp[n - 1][n - 1] = 0;
    paths[n - 1][n - 1] = 1;
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'X') continue;
            
            if (i + 1 < n && paths[i + 1][j] > 0) update(i, j, i + 1, j);
            if (j + 1 < n && paths[i][j + 1] > 0) update(i, j, i, j + 1);
            if (i + 1 < n && j + 1 < n && paths[i + 1][j + 1] > 0) update(i, j, i + 1, j + 1);
        }
    }
    
    function update(i, j, ni, nj) {
        let score = dp[ni][nj] + (board[i][j] === 'E' || board[i][j] === 'S' ? 0 : +board[i][j]);
        if (score > dp[i][j]) {
            dp[i][j] = score;
            paths[i][j] = paths[ni][nj];
        } else if (score === dp[i][j]) {
            paths[i][j] = (paths[i][j] + paths[ni][nj]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    return [dp[0][0], paths[0][0]];
};
```

By following this strategy, we efficiently find the maximum score and the number of paths yielding that score. The use of dynamic programming ensures that our solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
