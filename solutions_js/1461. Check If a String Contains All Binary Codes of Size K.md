[Leetcode 1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1461)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` if every binary code of length `k` is a substring of `s`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a binary code?**
   A binary code of size `k` is any string of length `k` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.

2. **What are the constraints on `s` and `k`?**
   Typical constraints include:
   - 1 <= `k` <= 20 (since there are `2^k` possible binary strings of size `k`).
   - 1 <= length of `s` <= 5 * 10^5.

3. **What should be returned if `k` is greater than the length of `s`?**
   If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, it is impossible for `s` to contain all binary codes of size `k`, so return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Possible Binary Codes of Size `k`:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to iterate through all substrings of length `k` within `s`.
   
2. **Use a Set to Track Unique Substrings:**
   - Add each substring of length `k` found in `s` to a set. This ensures each binary code is counted only once.
   
3. **Check the Number of Unique Substrings:**
   - Calculate the required number of unique substrings, which is `2^k`.
   - Check if the size of the set is equal to `2^k`.
   
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function hasAllCodes(s, k) {
    // If k is greater than the length of s, it is not possible to have all codes of length k
    if (k > s.length) return false;

    let codes = new Set();
    let requiredCodesCount = 1 << k; // This is equivalent to 2^k

    // Sliding window approach to capture all substrings of length k
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - k; i++) {
        let substring = s.substring(i, i + k);
        codes.add(substring);
        // Early exit condition if we've found all possible codes
        if (codes.size === requiredCodesCount) return true;
    }
    
    return codes.size === requiredCodesCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Constructing each substring of length `k` and adding it to the set takes O(k) time.
  - There are `s.length - k + 1` such substrings.
  - So, the overall time complexity is O(k * (s.length - k + 1)), which simplifies to O(k * s.length).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is primarily due to the set, which can hold at most `2^k` unique binary codes.
  - Thus the space complexity is O(2^k).

### Summary

The given algorithm uses a set to track seen substrings of length `k` and checks whether it has seen all `2^k` possible binary codes. The use of the sliding window approach ensures efficiency in terms of both time and space complexity within the given constraints.
