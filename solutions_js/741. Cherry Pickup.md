[Leetcode 741. Cherry Pickup](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l741)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid representing a field of cherries, where `grid[i][j]` is equal to `1` represents a cherry, `0` represents an empty cell, and `-1` represents a thorn that you cannot pass through. Your task is to collect the maximum number of cherries using the following rules:

1. You start at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and can move to the cell `(n-1, n-1)`.
2. After reaching `(n-1, n-1)`, you must return to `(0, 0)` to maximize the number of cherries collected through both routes.
3. From a cell `(i, j)`, you can move to `(i+1, j)` or `(i, j+1)` on the way to `(n-1, n-1)`.
4. On the way back, you can move to `(i-1, j)` or `(i, j-1)`.

Both players need to avoid cells with thorns, and both players should try to pick the maximum cherries, returning to the top-left cell. Initially, the `grid[0][0]` and `grid[n-1][n-1]` are guaranteed to be `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move diagonally?**
   - No, only the described directions are allowed.

2. **Are we guaranteed that there is a path from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)`?**
   - Not necessarily. We need to consider cases where a path might not exist.

3. **Can I pick the same cherry twice?**
   - No. Each cell with a cherry should only contribute once to the total count.

4. **What should we do if a path is blocked by thorns?**
   - If a path is blocked such that either player cannot reach `(0, 0)` or `(n-1, n-1)`, the total cherries collected is `0`.

### Strategy

1. Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem.
2. We will use a 3-D DP array `dp[x1][y1][x2]` representing:
   - `x1`, `y1`: coordinates of the first path walker.
   - `x2`, `y2`: coordinates of the second path walker, where `y2 = x1 + y1 - x2` because both people travel synchronously.
3. Initialize the DP array with negative values to mark uncomputed states.
4. For each state `(x1, y1, x2)`, calculate the possible cherries collected from `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
5. Transition states considering the valid movements:
   - Both move down.
   - Both move right.
   - One moves down, the other moves right, and vice versa.

### Code

```javascript
var cherryPickup = function(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const dp = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)));
    
    dp[0][0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    for (let x1 = 0; x1 < n; x1++) {
        for (let y1 = 0; y1 < n; y1++) {
            for (let x2 = 0; x2 < n; x2++) {
                let y2 = x1 + y1 - x2;
                if (y2 < 0 || y2 >= n || grid[x1][y1] == -1 || grid[x2][y2] == -1) {
                    continue;
                }
                
                let cherries = grid[x1][y1];
                if (x1 != x2) {
                    cherries += grid[x2][y2];
                }
                
                let prevMaxCherries = Math.max(
                  x1 > 0 && x2 > 0 ? dp[x1-1][y1][x2-1] : Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
                  x1 > 0 && y2 > 0 ? dp[x1-1][y1][x2] : Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
                  y1 > 0 && x2 > 0 ? dp[x1][y1-1][x2-1] : Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY,
                  y1 > 0 && y2 > 0 ? dp[x1][y1-1][x2] : Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
                );
                
                if (prevMaxCherries != Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) {
                    dp[x1][y1][x2] = prevMaxCherries + cherries;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return Math.max(0, dp[n-1][n-1][n-1]);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^3)` because we iterate over `x1`, `y1`, and `x2`, and for each combination, there are a constant number of state transitions.

- The space complexity is also `O(n^3)` for storing the 3-D DP array.

This dynamic programming approach efficiently captures the necessary states and transitions to solve the cherry pickup problem within acceptable limits.
