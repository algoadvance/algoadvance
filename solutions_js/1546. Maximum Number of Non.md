[Leetcode 1546. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1546)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `target`. Return the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is equal to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **Answer:** Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative numbers as well as zeros.

2. **Question:** What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?
   - **Answer:** The length of array `nums` can range from 1 to 10^5.

3. **Question:** What should be returned if no such subarray exists?
   - **Answer:** If no subarray meets the sum condition, the function should return 0.

### Strategy

1. Utilize a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the prefix sums and their occurrences.
2. Iterate through the array while maintaining the cumulative sum.
3. For each cumulative sum, check if there is a subarray ending at the current position which sums up to the target (using the hash map to determine this efficiently).
4. Reset the cumulative sum tracking whenever a valid subarray is found to ensure non-overlapping subarrays.
5. Use a counter to keep track of the number of valid subarrays found so far.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`, because we make a single pass through the array while performing constant-time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case for the hash map, as it will store cumulative sums up to n elements.

### Code

```javascript
var maxNonOverlapping = function(nums, target) {
    let prefixSumMap = new Map();
    prefixSumMap.set(0, 1); // base case: consider the prefix sum of 0 at the start
    let count = 0;
    let currentSum = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        currentSum += num;
        if (prefixSumMap.has(currentSum - target)) {
            count++;
            // Reset after finding a valid subarray to ensure non-overlapping subarrays
            prefixSumMap.clear();
            prefixSumMap.set(0, 1); // reinitialize for the next sequence
            currentSum = 0; // reset current sum
        } else {
            prefixSumMap.set(currentSum, 1);
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

In this code:
- `prefixSumMap` is used to track the cumulative sums.
- When a valid subarray is found, `currentSum` and the `prefixSumMap` are reset to ensure we start fresh for the next non-overlapping subarray.
- The `count` variable tracks the number of valid subarrays found.
