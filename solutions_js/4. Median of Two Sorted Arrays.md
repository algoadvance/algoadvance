[Leetcode 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l4)
### Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively. Return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
Output: 2.50000
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if one of the arrays is empty?**
   - The median would be the median of the non-empty array.
2. **Can we assume the input arrays are always sorted?**
   - Yes, the arrays are guaranteed to be sorted.
3. **Should the result always be a float, even if it's an integer value?**
   - Yes, return the result as a float.

### Strategy

To achieve the `O(log (m+n))` time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. The key idea is to partition the arrays into two halves such that the left half contains elements smaller or equal to the elements in the right half. 

Steps:
1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - Utilize binary search on the smaller array to ensure `O(log(min(m, n)))` complexity.
2. **Partition Logic:**
   - Partition both arrays into left and right halves.
   - Ensure the max element of the left half from both arrays is less than or equal to the min element of the right half.
3. **Calculation of Median:**
   - If combined arrays length is odd, the median is the maximum element of the left half.
   - If combined arrays length is even, the median is the average of the maximum element of the left half and the minimum element of the right half.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2) {
    if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
        [nums1, nums2] = [nums2, nums1];
    }
    
    let m = nums1.length;
    let n = nums2.length;
    let imin = 0, imax = m;
    let halfLen = Math.floor((m + n + 1) / 2);
    
    while (imin <= imax) {
        let i = Math.floor((imin + imax) / 2);
        let j = halfLen - i;
        
        if (i < m && nums1[i] < nums2[j - 1]) {
            imin = i + 1; // move i to the right
        } else if (i > 0 && nums1[i - 1] > nums2[j]) {
            imax = i - 1; // move i to the left
        } else {
            let maxOfLeft;
            if (i == 0) maxOfLeft = nums2[j - 1];
            else if (j == 0) maxOfLeft = nums1[i - 1];
            else maxOfLeft = Math.max(nums1[i - 1], nums2[j - 1]);
            
            if ((m + n) % 2 == 1) return maxOfLeft;
            
            let minOfRight;
            if (i == m) minOfRight = nums2[j];
            else if (j == n) minOfRight = nums1[i];
            else minOfRight = Math.min(nums1[i], nums2[j]);
            
            return (maxOfLeft + minOfRight) / 2.0;
        }
    }
    
    throw new Error("Input arrays are not sorted or invalid.");
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(log(min(m, n)))` due to the binary search on the smaller array.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution leverages binary search efficiently to meet the constraints and accurately compute the median of two sorted arrays.
