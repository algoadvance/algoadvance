[Leetcode 2641. Cousins in Binary Tree II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2641)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, we need to replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of values in the tree's `cousin` nodes. Two nodes in a binary tree are considered cousins if they have the same depth but different parents. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Definition of a Binary Tree:**
   - Is it a complete binary tree?
   - Can it be a single node?

2. **Input Specifications:**
   - What is the expected input format? For example, is it a TreeNode structure?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if the tree is empty?
   - Should we handle trees with only one node?

### Strategy
1. **Traverse the Tree by Levels:**
   - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level-by-level.
   - During the BFS traversal, maintain track of each node's depth and parent.

2. **Calculate Cousins' Values:**
   - For each node, sum the values of other nodes at the same depth but different parents to replace the node's value.

### Implementation:
We will use a BFS approach to traverse the tree and then calculate the cousin values.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function replaceWithCousinsSum(root) {
    if (!root) return null;

    // Step 1: Level Order Traversal to record parent and depth information
    let levelOrder = [];
    let queue = [{ node: root, depth: 0, parent: null }];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let currentLevel = [];
        let currentQueueSize = queue.length;

        for (let i = 0; i < currentQueueSize; i++) {
            let { node, depth, parent } = queue.shift();
            currentLevel.push({ node, depth, parent });
            
            if (node.left) queue.push({ node: node.left, depth: depth + 1, parent: node });
            if (node.right) queue.push({ node: node.right, depth: depth + 1, parent: node });
        }
        
        levelOrder.push(currentLevel);
    }

    // Step 2: Compute the Cousins' sum for each node
    for (let level of levelOrder) {
        let totalSum = level.reduce((acc, elem) => acc + elem.node.val, 0);
        
        for (let elem of level) {
            let cousinSum = totalSum - elem.node.val;
            elem.node.val = cousinSum;
        }
    }

    return root;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **BFS Traversal:** O(n) - where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is to traverse all the nodes once.
2. **Computing Cousin Sums:** O(n) - since we are iterating through nodes again to compute the cousin sums per level.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given we need to touch each node at least once.

### Space Complexity
1. **Queue for BFS:** O(n) - in the worst case, the queue will hold all the nodes.
2. **Auxiliary Space for levelOrder:** O(n) - storing all nodes temporarily for depth and parent data.

So, the overall space complexity is O(n).
