[Leetcode 2468. Split Message Based on Limit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2468)
### Problem Statement

Design a messaging system that splits longer messages into smaller pieces which fit within a specified character limit `limit`. Each piece should also indicate its sequence order and the total number of pieces, in the format `"<text> <sequence>/<total_pieces>"`. 

Given the `message` string and the `limit` integer, split the message into the required format while ensuring that the length of each piece, including its sequence information, does not exceed `limit`. If it's impossible to split the message accordingly, return an empty array.

The final list of message pieces should be in their correct order of appearance.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Limits and Edge Cases**:
   - What is the maximum length of the `message`?
   - What is the minimum allowable value for `limit`?

2. **Sequence Information**:
   - How should the sequence order be formatted if there are more than 9 pieces, e.g., should we worry about the length of sequence indicators mentioned?

3. **Content**:
   - Are we considering only ASCII characters for simplicity?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the number of pieces required by initially assuming each piece will contain no less than 1 character along with the sequence information.
  
2. **Trial and Error**:
   - Incrementally try to allocate characters to pieces ensuring that they fit within the limit when combined with the sequence information ("{index}/{total_pieces}").
   - Adjust and check if the combination of text and sequence info within the given limit can accommodate the message.

3. **Formulate Pieces**:
   - Once the number of pieces is confirmed, split the message accordingly.
   - Ensure to properly handle the formatting of each piece to include the sequence meta-info.

### Code

```javascript
function splitMessage(message, limit) {
    let n = message.length;
    
    function messageLength(k) {
        let numParts = k.toString().length;
        let i = 1;
        let total = 0;
        
        while (true) {
            let partSize = limit - (i.toString().length + 1 + numParts + 1);
            let partCountForThisLength = Math.min(k - total, Math.pow(10, i.toString().length) - i);
            total += partCountForThisLength * partSize;
            if (total >= n) break;
            i++;
        }
        
        return total >= n ? i : -1;
    }

    let totalPieces = -1;
    for (let k = Math.ceil(n / (limit - 3)); k <= n; k++) {
        if (messageLength(k) !== -1) {
            totalPieces = k;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (totalPieces === -1) return [];

    let result = [];
    let idx = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= totalPieces; i++) {
        let suffix = `${i}/${totalPieces}`;
        let availableLength = limit - 2 - suffix.length;
        
        result.push(message.substring(idx, idx + availableLength) + ' ' + suffix);
        idx += availableLength;
    }

    return result;
}
```
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(k * log(N)), where k is the number of pieces and N is the length of the message. We iterate to find `totalPieces` and check message length accordingly.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), for storing the final split messages array.

This approach ensures that each piece is compliant with the length specification while including necessary sequence information. It handles edge cases where the message might be too long to fit the `limit` properly and returns an empty array if splitting is impossible.
