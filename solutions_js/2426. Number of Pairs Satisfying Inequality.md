[Leetcode 2426. Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2426)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` each of size `n` and an integer `diff`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few things:
1. Will the arrays always have the same length? (Assume yes for now).
2. Can the `nums1` or `nums2` arrays contain negative numbers? (Assume yes for now).
3. What is the range of possible values for `diff`? (Assume it spans typical integer limits).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can transform the given condition:

1. `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`
2. Rearrange the terms: `nums1[i] - nums2[i] <= nums1[j] - nums2[j] + diff`

Define a new array `transformed` where:
- `transformed[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i]`

The problem now reduces to finding pairs `(i, j)` such that:
- `transformed[i] <= transformed[j] + diff`

This type of problem can be solved efficiently using a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or a Segment Tree for maintaining and querying prefix sums. However, for simplicity and feasibility in an interview setting, we can use a more straightforward merge sort-based approach.

### Code Implementation

Here's the implementation of the solution using a modified merge sort approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums1
 * @param {number[]} nums2
 * @param {number} diff
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfPairs = function(nums1, nums2, diff) {
    const n = nums1.length;
    const transformed = Array(n).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        transformed[i] = nums1[i] - nums2[i];
    }
    
    const mergeSortAndCount = (arr, start, end) => {
        if (start >= end) return 0;
        const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        let count = mergeSortAndCount(arr, start, mid) + mergeSortAndCount(arr, mid + 1, end);
        
        let j = mid + 1;
        for (let i = start; i <= mid; i++) {
            while (j <= end && arr[i] > arr[j] + diff) {
                j++;
            }
            count += (j - (mid + 1));
        }
        
        // Merge the two halves
        let leftArr = arr.slice(start, mid + 1);
        let rightArr = arr.slice(mid + 1, end + 1);
        let k = start, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < leftArr.length && j < rightArr.length) {
            if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
                arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
            } else {
                arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];
            }
        }
        while (i < leftArr.length) {
            arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
        }
        while (j < rightArr.length) {
            arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];
        }
        
        return count;
    };
    
    return mergeSortAndCount(transformed, 0, n - 1);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Transform Step:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Merge Sort Counting Step:** O(n log n), as this involves recursively breaking down the array and merging it back together while counting valid pairs.

Thus, the overall complexity of the solution is O(n log n).
