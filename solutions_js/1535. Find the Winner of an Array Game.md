[Leetcode 1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1535)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` of distinct integers and an integer `k`.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game:
- If `arr[0] < arr[1]`, the winner of the round is `arr[1]`, and `arr[0]` is moved to the end of the array.
- Otherwise, the winner is `arr[0]`, and `arr[1]` is moved to the end of the array.
- The game ends when an element wins `k` consecutive rounds.

The winner of the game is the first element to win `k` consecutive rounds.

Return the winner of the game.

## Clarifying Questions

- Can the array size be very large?
- Is there a guaranteed winner within a reasonable amount of rounds, given the constraints?

## Strategy

1. We start by simulating the described game.
2. We keep track of the current element which is winning and the count of the consecutive wins.
3. If at any time, a new element needs to be moved to the end of the array, we refresh the count.
4. Continue until an element wins `k` consecutive rounds or the strongest element is found (which will eventually win).

## Code

```javascript
function getWinner(arr, k) {
    let currentWinner = arr[0];
    let consecutiveWins = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > currentWinner) {
            currentWinner = arr[i];
            consecutiveWins = 1;
        } else {
            consecutiveWins++;
        }
        
        if (consecutiveWins === k) {
            return currentWinner;
        }
    }
    
    return currentWinner;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialize**:
   - `currentWinner` is the first element of the array, as initially it is the assumed winner.
   - `consecutiveWins` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop through the Array**:
   - Start looping from the second element (index 1) to end.
   - If the current element (`arr[i]`) is greater than `currentWinner`:
     - Update `currentWinner` to `arr[i]`.
     - Reset `consecutiveWins` to 1.
   - Otherwise, increment `consecutiveWins`.
   - If `consecutiveWins` reaches `k`, return `currentWinner`.
   
3. **Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding `k` consecutive wins, the strongest element in the array will always be the potential winner.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) because we are essentially processing each element a single time.
- Space complexity is O(1) because we utilize a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
