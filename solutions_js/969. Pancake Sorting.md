[Leetcode 969. Pancake Sorting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l969)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to sort the array through a series of "pancake flips". In one pancake flip, you can do the following steps:
1. Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
2. Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]`.

You need to return the sequence of `k` values corresponding to a sequence of flips in order to sort the array. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range and size of the input array**: What is the potential range and number of elements in the array?
   - The array can contain integers from 0 to 100 with a length up to 100.
2. **Nature of the array**: Are there any constraints on the array; is it always unsorted or can it be partially sorted?
   - The array is generally unsorted, and any valid permutation can be presented.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, a good strategy is to repeatedly move the largest unsorted element to its correct position. This can be accomplished by:
1. Finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
2. Flipping the portion of the array up to the maximum element to move it to the front.
3. Flipping the entire unsorted portion to move the maximum element to its correct sorted position at the end of that portion.

This process is repeated, reducing the size of the unsorted portion by one each time until the entire array is sorted.

### Step-by-Step Code Implementation

1. **Finding maximum element and its index** within a specific range in the array.
2. **Flipping the array** up to a specific index.
3. **Iteratively sorting** the array using these two steps.

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function pancakeSort(arr) {
    const flips = [];

    const flip = (k) => {
        let start = 0;
        while (start < k) {
            [arr[start], arr[k]] = [arr[k], arr[start]];
            start++;
            k--;
        }
    };

    for (let size = arr.length; size > 1; size--) {
        let maxIdx = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < size; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[maxIdx]) {
                maxIdx = i;
            }
        }
        
        if (maxIdx + 1 !== size) {
            // If the max value is not at the last position of the unsorted portion
            if (maxIdx !== 0) {
                flips.push(maxIdx + 1);
                flip(maxIdx);
            }
            flips.push(size);
            flip(size - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return flips;
}
```

### Example

Let's take a small example to illustrate how this works:

```javascript
const arr = [3, 2, 4, 1];
const result = pancakeSort(arr);
console.log(result); // Expected a sequence of flips like [3, 4, 2, 3, 2]
console.log(arr); // Expected sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the maximum element** takes `O(n)` in the worst case.
- **Flipping the array** takes `O(n)` in the worst case.
- Since these operations occur inside a loop that runs potentially `n` times (where `n` is the number of elements), the total time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

This \(O(n^2)\) complexity is acceptable given the problem constraints where the maximum length \(n\) is 100.
