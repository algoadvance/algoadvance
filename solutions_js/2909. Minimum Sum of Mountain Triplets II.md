[Leetcode 2909. Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2909)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers, where `n` is a multiple of 3. You need to partition the array into `n/3` triplets of the form `(a, b, c)` where `a < b < c`. You have to find the minimum possible sum of the `n/3` `b` elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the array guaranteed to follow the rule `n % 3 == 0`?
   - What is the range of the integer values in the array and the array length?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the solution return the minimal possible sum of the middle elements `b` in all the valid triplets `(a, b, c)`?
   - Is there a possibility that a valid partition isn't possible? 

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the solution handle cases with the smallest possible input size (e.g., `n = 3`)?

### Strategy

To tackle this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the array**: This step simplifies the process of partitioning the array into valid triplets `(a < b < c)`.
2. **Form triplets**: Given the sorted array, the smallest possible triplet can be formed by taking elements at indexes at intervals which ensures `a < b < c`.
3. **Sum the middle elements `b`** from these triplets.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that we can easily pick elements to form valid triplets.
   
2. **Pick middle elements `b`**:
   - For every group of 3 elements in the sorted array, the second element is the middle element `b`.

3. **Calculate sum of all middle elements `b`**.

### Code

Here is how you can implement the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumSumOfMiddleTriplets = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Step 1: Sort the array
    
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i += 3) {
        sum += nums[i]; // Step 3: Sum of middle elements in each triplet
    }
    
    return sum;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(minimumSumOfMiddleTriplets(nums)); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Summing middle elements**: O(n / 3) which simplifies to O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**. The space complexity is **O(1)** (ignoring the space used by the sorting algorithm).

### Conclusion

This strategy guarantees that we get the minimal possible sum of middle elements `b` in the triplets `(a, b, c)` by leveraging the properties of sorted arrays. The approach is efficient and straightforward.
