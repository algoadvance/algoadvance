[Leetcode 913. Cat and Mouse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l913)
### Problem Statement

This is a game played between two players: "Mouse" and "Cat". The game is played on a graph shown as an `n`-node undirected graph, where node `0` is the `Hole`, node `1` is the `Mouse` and node `2` is the `Cat`. The graph is given as follows:

- The `graph` is represented as a list `graph` where `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b`.

Mouse and Cat take turns starting with Mouse. In each turn, they must move to an adjacent node (i.e., a node directly connected to their current node). 

Additionally:
- The cat cannot move to the hole (node 0).
- The Mouse wins if it reaches the hole (node 0).
- The Cat wins if it catches the mouse (i.e., they both move to the same node).
- The game is a draw if it continues indefinitely considering both players play optimally.

Determine the outcome of the game if both players play optimally.

Return:
- `1` if the Mouse wins,
- `2` if the Cat wins,
- `0` if the game is a draw.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any limits on n or the size of the graph list?
2. Are there any cycles in the graph, or will it always be a tree?
3. Can both the Mouse and Cat begin at the same node other than 0?

### Strategy
1. This problem can be visualized as a graph traversal problem with additional game theory concepts. 
2. We'll utilize dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the game states.
3. The DP state will be represented by a triplet `(m, c, t)`:
   - `m`: the current position of the mouse.
   - `c`: the current position of the cat.
   - `t`: whose turn it is (0 for Mouse, 1 for Cat).
4. State transitions:
   - Mouse moves from `m` to any of its adjacent nodes in `graph[m]`.
   - Cat moves from `c` to any of its adjacent nodes in `graph[c]` (except `0`).

5. Base cases:
   - If `m == 0`, the Mouse wins.
   - If `m == c`, the Cat wins.

6. The challenge arises in establishing the game's iterative or recursive states to avoid indefinite loops and compute the optimal moves for both players.
7. Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) strategy, updating each state until all states are determined or proven to be cycles (draws).

### Time Complexity
The complexity mainly depends on the number of states and transitions. If we assume `V` is the number of vertices:
- There are `O(V^2 * 2)` possible states (`2` represents the two possible turns).
- For each state, processing involves checking up to `V` neighbors, resulting in an elaborate but manageable complexity for given constraints.

### Code

```javascript
var catMouseGame = function(graph) {
    const n = graph.length;
    const MOUSE_TURN = 0, CAT_TURN = 1;
    const DRAW = 0, MOUSE_WIN = 1, CAT_WIN = 2;

    // dp[m][c][t]: game state where mouse is at m, cat is at c, and it's turn t.
    const dp = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(2).fill(-1)));

    const getResult = (mouse, cat, turn) => {
        if (mouse == 0) return MOUSE_WIN;
        if (mouse == cat) return CAT_WIN;
        if (dp[mouse][cat][turn] !== -1) return dp[mouse][cat][turn];

        if (turn === MOUSE_TURN) {
            let mouseResult = CAT_WIN;
            for (const nextMouse of graph[mouse]) {
                const result = getResult(nextMouse, cat, CAT_TURN);
                if (result === MOUSE_WIN) {
                    mouseResult = MOUSE_WIN;
                    break;
                } else if (result === DRAW) {
                    mouseResult = DRAW;
                }
            }
            dp[mouse][cat][turn] = mouseResult;
        } else {
            let catResult = MOUSE_WIN;
            for (const nextCat of graph[cat]) {
                if (nextCat === 0) continue; // Cat can't move to hole
                const result = getResult(mouse, nextCat, MOUSE_TURN);
                if (result === CAT_WIN) {
                    catResult = CAT_WIN;
                    break;
                } else if (result === DRAW) {
                    catResult = DRAW;
                }
            }
            dp[mouse][cat][turn] = catResult;
        }
        return dp[mouse][cat][turn];
    };

    return getResult(1, 2, MOUSE_TURN);
};
```

This code uses recursive memoization (dynamic programming) to store game states, solving the problem optimally by leveraging depth-first search (DFS) transitions. The solution avoids unnecessary recomputation and captures winning or drawing states effectively.
