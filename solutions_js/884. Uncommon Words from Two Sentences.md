[Leetcode 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l884)
## Problem Statement

Let's define `uncommon words` as words that appear exactly once in one of the sentences, and do not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example

**Input:**
```plaintext
s1 = "this apple is sweet"
s2 = "this apple is sour"
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["sweet", "sour"]
```

**Input:**
```plaintext
s1 = "apple apple"
s2 = "banana"
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["banana"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **The sentences are composed of lower-case letters only and spaces, correct?**
   - Yes, the sentences contain only lower-case letters and spaces.
   
2. **Do we need to worry about punctuation or any non-alphabetic characters?**
   - No, only alphabetic characters and spaces are present.

3. **Can the same word appear multiple times in either of the sentences?**
   - Yes, and if a word appears more than once in a sentence, it will not be considered `uncommon`.

4. **Is there a minimum length for sentences `s1` and `s2`?**
   - Yes, 1 ≤ length of each sentence ≤ 200.

## Strategy

1. **Tokenize Sentences:**
   - Split both `s1` and `s2` into individual words.

2. **Count Word Frequencies:**
   - Use two objects (or hashmaps) to count the frequency of each word in `s1` and `s2`.

3. **Merge Frequencies:**
   - Combine these frequencies to find words that occur exactly once in one of the sentences but not the other.

4. **Filter Uncommon Words:**
   - Iterate through the combined frequencies and collect words that meet our criteria.

## Code

```javascript
function uncommonFromSentences(s1, s2) {
    const wordCount = {};

    // Split and count words in the first sentence
    s1.split(' ').forEach(word => {
        if (wordCount[word] === undefined) {
            wordCount[word] = 0;
        }
        wordCount[word]++;
    });

    // Split and count words in the second sentence
    s2.split(' ').forEach(word => {
        if (wordCount[word] === undefined) {
            wordCount[word] = 0;
        }
        wordCount[word]++;
    });

    // Find words which have a count of exactly 1
    const result = [];
    for (const word in wordCount) {
        if (wordCount[word] === 1) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(uncommonFromSentences("this apple is sweet", "this apple is sour")); // ["sweet", "sour"]
console.log(uncommonFromSentences("apple apple", "banana")); // ["banana"]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting Sentences:** O(n + m) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` respectively.
- **Counting Words:** O(n + m) for processing both sentences.
- **Finding Uncommon Words:** O(k) where `k` is the number of unique words in the combined sentences.

Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(n + m + k)**, which is linear with respect to the size of the inputs.
