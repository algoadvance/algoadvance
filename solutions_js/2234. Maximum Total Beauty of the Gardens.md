[Leetcode 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2234)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `flowers` where `flowers[i]` represents the beauty of the `i`-th flower. You are also given an integer `newFlowers` representing the number of flowers you can add, an integer `target`, and an integer `full`. 

The garden's total beauty is calculated as follows:
- for each garden where the number of flowers is at least `target`, it contributes `full` beauty to the total.
- For gardens with fewer than `target` flowers, you can use your `newFlowers` to increase the number of flowers in these gardens.

You need to maximize the total beauty of all the gardens.

Write a function to calculate the maximum total beauty.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: flowers = [1, 3, 1, 2], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 10
Output: 60
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the beauty of a garden exceed the `target`?
2. Is `newFlowers` bounded or can it be negative?

## Strategy
1. Sort the `flowers` array to prioritize smaller gardens.
2. Use a greedy approach to add flowers to the gardens starting from the smallest up to the `target`.
3. Calculate the total beauty by checking how many gardens have reached the `target` and multiplied by the `full` value.

## Code
```javascript
function maximumBeauty(flowers, newFlowers, target, full) {
    // Step 1: Sort the flowers array
    flowers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = flowers.length;
    let totalBeauty = 0;

    // Step 2: Use a greedy approach to increase the number of flowers
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (flowers[i] < target) {
            let neededFlowers = target - flowers[i];
            if (newFlowers >= neededFlowers) {
                newFlowers -= neededFlowers;
                flowers[i] = target;
            } else {
                flowers[i] += newFlowers;
                newFlowers = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Calculate the total beauty
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (flowers[i] >= target) {
            totalBeauty += full;
        }
    }
    return totalBeauty;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumBeauty([1, 3, 1, 2], 7, 6, 10)); // Output: 60
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the `flowers` array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the `flowers` array.
- The for loop runs in \(O(n)\) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we are efficiently allocating the new flowers to maximize the garden's total beauty.
