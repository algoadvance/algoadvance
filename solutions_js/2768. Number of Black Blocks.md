[Leetcode 2768. Number of Black Blocks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2768)
### Problem Statement

You are given a grid filled with black and white blocks. Your task is to count the number of black blocks in the grid and generate the number of black blocks in each row and column.

For each cell, the color is represented as follows:
- 0: White Block
- 1: Black Block

Implement a function `countBlackBlocks(grid)`, which takes a two-dimensional array `grid` as an argument and returns a two-element array. The first element is the total number of black blocks. The second element is an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a row or column and contains:
- `row`: The row number
- `count`: The number of black blocks in that row

or

- `col`: The column number
- `count`: The number of black blocks in that column

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of the grid? 
    - Are the rows and columns always guaranteed to have at least one black block?

2. **Output Format**:
    - How should the row and column information be structured in the output array? 
    - Should the output array have a specific order for the rows and columns?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Should we consider grids that have only black blocks or only white blocks?
    - How should we handle empty grids?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - A variable to keep the count of total black blocks.
    - Two arrays to keep track of black blocks in each row and each column.

2. **Iterate Through Grid**:
    - Iterate through the grid to count total black blocks.
    - Update row and column counts accordingly.

3. **Construct the Result**:
    - Construct the result required to return.

### Code

```javascript
function countBlackBlocks(grid) {
    const numRows = grid.length;
    const numCols = grid[0].length;
    let totalBlackBlocks = 0;

    const rowCounts = Array(numRows).fill(0);
    const colCounts = Array(numCols).fill(0);

    for (let r = 0; r < numRows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < numCols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
                totalBlackBlocks++;
                rowCounts[r]++;
                colCounts[c]++;
            }
        }
    }

    const rowResult = rowCounts.map((count, idx) => ({ row: idx, count }));
    const colResult = colCounts.map((count, idx) => ({ col: idx, count }));

    return [totalBlackBlocks, rowResult.concat(colResult)];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The above solution iterates through the entire grid once:
- For a grid of size `n x m`, the time complexity is **O(n * m)**.
- Space complexity is **O(n + m)** due to the storage of row and column counts.

This solution should be efficient for grids up to reasonable sizes encountered in typical interview problems.
