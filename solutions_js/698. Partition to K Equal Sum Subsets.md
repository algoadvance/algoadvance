[Leetcode 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l698)
## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if it is possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

### Example:

- Input: `nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1]`, `k = 4`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: It's possible to partition the array into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 3), with equal sums.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be returned if `nums` can't be partitioned?**
   - Return `false`.

2. **Can there be negative numbers in `nums`?**
   - No, typically `nums` contains positive integers.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the list will be non-empty and k will be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, you can assume `nums` will be a non-empty array and `k` will be a positive integer less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

## Strategy:

1. **Calculate the total sum**:
   - If the total sum is not divisible by `k`, return `false`.
   - Compute the target sum for each subset as `total_sum / k`.

2. **Sort `nums` in descending order**:
   - This helps in early termination of recursive calls by trying larger numbers first.

3. **Define a recursive backtracking function**:
   - Use a helper function to attempt to fill each of the `k` subsets.
   - Track the sums of the current subsets.
   - Track which elements have been used with a boolean array.

4. **Base case**:
   - If we've created the required `k-1` subsets successfully, return `true` because the last subset will naturally match the target sum (due to the sum of elements left).

5. **Recursive step**:
   - Try adding each unused element to the current subset, and recurse.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canPartitionKSubsets = function(nums, k) {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    if (totalSum % k !== 0) return false;

    const target = totalSum / k;
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    if (nums[0] > target) return false;

    const used = new Array(nums.length).fill(false);
    
    function canPartition(startIndex, numberOfSubsets, currentSum) {
        if (numberOfSubsets === 0) return true;
        if (currentSum === target) {
            return canPartition(0, numberOfSubsets - 1, 0);
        }

        for (let i = startIndex; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (!used[i] && currentSum + nums[i] <= target) {
                used[i] = true;
                if (canPartition(i + 1, numberOfSubsets, currentSum + nums[i])) {
                    return true;
                }
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    return canPartition(0, k, 0);
};
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is `O(k * 2^n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is due to the recursive backtracking method which tries to create the subsets by exploring all possible combinations. Sorting the array initially takes `O(n log n)` time, but the dominating factor is the recursion. 

In the worst case, we may need to examine every possible subset combination, so although it is optimized through sorting and early termination, it remains an exponential time complexity problem.
