[Leetcode 3098. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3098)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from `nums`. For each subsequence, calculate the power as the sum of its elements multiplied by the length of the subsequence. Your task is to return the sum of the powers of all non-empty subsequences of `nums`. The result can be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- Output: `44`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
2. What is the maximum length of the array?
3. Can the array be empty?

Once the clarifications are addressed, we can proceed with the solution.

### Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to compute the sum of powers of all non-empty subsequences.
   
2. **Direct Approach**:
   - Calculate all possible subsequences.
   - For each subsequence, compute its power and add it to the final result.
   - However, this direct approach is computationally infeasible for larger arrays due to the exponential number of subsequences.

3. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Utilize the power set properties and combinatorics to avoid explicitly computing each subsequence.
   - Because the problem's constraints imply we need an efficient solution, we can leverage combinatorial sums.

4. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - For each element `nums[i]` in the array:
     - It contributes to many subsequences.
     - Calculate the sum contributions of each element based on its presence in various subsequences.
   
   - **Contribution Insight**:
     - Any given element appears in exactly `2^(n-1)` subsequences considering all positions it can occupy (where n is the length of the array).
     - For each of these subsequences, it contributes to the power based on the sum rule.
     - Aggregate these contributions.

### Code Implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
const sumSubsequencePowers = function(nums) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Calculate 2^(n-1) with modular arithmetic
    const pow_set_size = (1 << (n - 1)) % MOD;
    
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let contribution = (nums[i] * pow_set_size * n) % MOD;
        result = (result + contribution) % MOD;
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example:
console.log(sumSubsequencePowers([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 44
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of space for storing variables.

This approach leverages mathematical properties to efficiently compute the desired result without generating all subsequences explicitly.
