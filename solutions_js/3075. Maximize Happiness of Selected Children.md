[Leetcode 3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3075)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with selecting a group of children from a list to maximize their collective happiness. Each child has a specific level of happiness and a weight (perhaps indicating the difficulty of handling this child). You can only bring a maximum weight of children. Implement a function to determine the maximum happiness you can achieve within the given weight limit.

You will be given:
- An array of integers `happiness` where `happiness[i]` represents the happiness level of the i-th child.
- An array of integers `weights` where `weights[i]` represents the weight of the i-th child.
- An integer `maxWeight` which is the maximum total weight of children you can select.

The task is to find the maximum sum of happiness you can achieve without exceeding the `maxWeight`.

## Example

```javascript
const happiness = [1, 2, 3, 5];
const weights = [2, 3, 4, 5];
const maxWeight = 5;

const result = maximizeHappiness(happiness, weights, maxWeight);
console.log(result); // Expected output: 5 (selecting the fourth child)
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the weight or happiness values be negative? 
   - Assume all weights and happiness values are non-negative integers.
   
2. Is there a guarantee on the size of the input arrays?
   - For simplicity, assume we will handle inputs that reasonably fit in typical memory limits for an interview problem.

3. Can we assume that the input arrays are always of the same length?
   - Yes, `happiness.length === weights.length`.

## Code

### Strategy

This problem is a variation of the Knapsack Problem. To solve it, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a `dp` array where `dp[j]` represents the maximum happiness achievable with a total weight of `j`.

1. Initialize a `dp` array of size `maxWeight + 1` with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterate through each child.
3. For each child, iterate from `maxWeight` down to the weight of the current child, and update the `dp` array.
4. Return the maximum value from the `dp` array.

### Implementation

```javascript
function maximizeHappiness(happiness, weights, maxWeight) {
    const n = happiness.length;
    const dp = new Array(maxWeight + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = maxWeight; j >= weights[i]; j--) {
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - weights[i]] + happiness[i]);
        }
    }
    
    return Math.max(...dp);
}

// Example usage:
const happiness = [1, 2, 3, 5];
const weights = [2, 3, 4, 5];
const maxWeight = 5;

const result = maximizeHappiness(happiness, weights, maxWeight);
console.log(result); // Expected output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n \times W) \), where \( n \) is the number of children, and \( W \) is the maximum weight (`maxWeight`).
- The space complexity is \( O(W) \) due to the `dp` array.

This should efficiently handle reasonable input sizes typical of coding interview scenarios.
