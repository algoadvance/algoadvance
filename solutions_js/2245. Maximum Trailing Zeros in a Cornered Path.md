[Leetcode 2245. Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2245)
### Problem Statement

You're given a `m x n` integer `grid` where each integer has unique value. You are allowed to take a cornered path through the grid starting from any cell and ending at any cell. A cornered path is a path where you start at some cell `(i, j)`, move right to some cell in the same row `(i, k)` for `k ≥ j`, then down to some cell in the same column `(l, k)` for `l ≥ i`. Your goal is to find the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of all values along a cornered path within the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a "cornered path"?**
   - A cornered path starts at any cell `(i, j)`, moves right to any `(i, k)`, then moves down to any cell `(l, k)`.
   
2. **What do "trailing zeros" mean in this context?**
   - Trailing zeros in a number are the zeros at the end of the number. For example, 1000 has 3 trailing zeros.
   
3. **What are the grid dimensions `m` and `n` or constraints?**
   - The grid can be any size, and the constraints should be provided in the problem to guide an efficient algorithm.

### Strategy

1. **Factor Count Calculation:**
   - Trailing zeros result from pairs of factors of `2` and `5` in the numbers. Therefore, we need to count the number of `2`s and `5`s in the prime factorization of each cell's value.
   
2. **Prefix Summation:**
   - Compute prefix sums of counts of factors of `2` and `5` for each row and column to allow efficient querying of cornered path sums.
   
3. **Path Summation:**
   - For each potential corner in the grid, calculate the number of `2`s and `5`s in the product along the cornered path using the prefix sums.
   
4. **Find Max Trailing Zeros:**
   - For the product along a given path, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the count of `2`s and `5`s.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxTrailingZeros(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    const twoCount = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    const fiveCount = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Function to count the number of 2's and 5's in the factorization of x
    const factorCount = (x, factor) => {
        let count = 0;
        while (x % factor === 0) {
            x /= factor;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    };

    // Fill twoCount and fiveCount matrices
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            twoCount[i][j] = factorCount(grid[i][j], 2);
            fiveCount[i][j] = factorCount(grid[i][j], 5);
        }
    }
    
    // Prefix sums for rows and columns for both twoCount and fiveCount
    const prefixRowTwo = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    const prefixRowFive = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    const prefixColTwo = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m + 1).fill(0));
    const prefixColFive = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m + 1).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            prefixRowTwo[i][j + 1] = prefixRowTwo[i][j] + twoCount[i][j];
            prefixRowFive[i][j + 1] = prefixRowFive[i][j] + fiveCount[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            prefixColTwo[j][i + 1] = prefixColTwo[j][i] + twoCount[i][j];
            prefixColFive[j][i + 1] = prefixColFive[j][i] + fiveCount[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    let maxTrailingZeros = 0;
    
    // Calculate maximum trailing zeros for each corner path
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (let x = i; x < m; x++) {
                for (let y = j; y < n; y++) {
                    const twoRight = prefixRowTwo[i][y + 1] - prefixRowTwo[i][j];
                    const fiveRight = prefixRowFive[i][y + 1] - prefixRowFive[i][j];
                    const twoDown = prefixColTwo[j][x + 1] - prefixColTwo[j][i];
                    const fiveDown = prefixColFive[j][x + 1] - prefixColFive[j][i];
                    
                    const totalTwo = twoRight + twoDown - twoCount[i][j];
                    const totalFive = fiveRight + fiveDown - fiveCount[i][j];
                    
                    maxTrailingZeros = Math.max(maxTrailingZeros, Math.min(totalTwo, totalFive));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxTrailingZeros;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Factor Count Calculation:**
  - Iterates over the grid cells: \( O(m \times n) \)
  
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - Again iterates over the grid cells for rows and columns: \( O(m \times n) \)
  
- **Path Summation:**
  - Consider each cell as a potential corner and computes for all possible endpoint pairs: \( O(m^2 \times n^2) \)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(m^2 \times n^2) \). This may need further optimization for very large grids.
