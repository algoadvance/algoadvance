[Leetcode 2023. Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2023)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `nums` and a string `target`, return the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` (where `i` != `j`) such that the concatenation of `nums[i] + nums[j]` is equal to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size of the input list `nums`?**
   - This helps understand the potential time complexity constraints.

2. **Can elements in `nums` be empty strings?**
   - This could affect how we handle concatenations.

3. **Are the strings in `nums` always non-null?**
   - Assumptions on input validity affect our boundary checks.

4. **Is `target` always a valid string and non-null?**
   - Assumes no need for null checks on `target`.

Let's proceed assuming that the inputs are valid, non-null strings.

### Strategy
Here's a general approach to solve the problem:

1. **Initialization**: We'll use a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
2. **Two Pointers Approach**: 
    - Iterate through the list using a nested loop to form pairs of indices `(i, j)`.
    - If the concatenation of `nums[i] + nums[j]` equals the `target`, increment the counter.

This approach needs to check each pair exactly once, assuring `i != j`.

### Code
```javascript
var numOfPairs = function(nums, target) {
    let count = 0;
    let n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i !== j && (nums[i] + nums[j] === target)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numOfPairs(["123","4","12","34"], "1234")); // Output: 2
console.log(numOfPairs(["1","1","1"], "11"));           // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we are using two nested loops to form pairs and compare their concatenation to the target.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size, apart from a few variables.
