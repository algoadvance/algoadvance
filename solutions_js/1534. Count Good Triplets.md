[Leetcode 1534. Count Good Triplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1534)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, and three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, you need to find the number of good triplets.

A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is good if the following conditions are true:
1. `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
2. `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
3. `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
4. `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Return the number of good triplets.

### Function Signature
```javascript
function countGoodTriplets(arr, a, b, c) {
    // your code here
}
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Do the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `arr` fall within specific ranges? (While it's not strictly necessary to solve the problem knowing that they are reasonable helps ensure performance considerations are adequate)

2. **Output Specifications:** Should the function print the result or return it? (Implicitly the function returns the result, but let's confirm.)

## Code

```javascript
function countGoodTriplets(arr, a, b, c) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) > a) continue;
            for (let k = j + 1; k < arr.length; k++) {
                if (Math.abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b && Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Nested Loops:** We will use three nested loops to go through all triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`.
2. **Condition Checks:** Inside the innermost loop, we check the conditions:
   - `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
   - `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
   - `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`
3. **Counting Valid Triplets:** If the conditions are met, increment the counter.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^3)` where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we are using three nested loops to check all potential triplets `(i, j, k)`.

This solution is straightforward but might not be efficient for large input sizes due to the cubic time complexity. However, it guarantees correctness for the given problem constraints based on typical competitive programming limits. If needed, optimization strategies can be discussed or further researched.
