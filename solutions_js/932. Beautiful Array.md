[Leetcode 932. Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l932)
### Problem Statement

We are given an integer `n`. Our task is to return an array `nums` of length `n` such that for every `i < j`, there is no `k` with `i < k < j` such that `nums[k] * 2 = nums[i] + nums[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the properties of the returned array?**
   - The array should be such that for every `i < j`, there is no `k` with `i < k < j` satisfying `nums[k] * 2 = nums[i] + nums[j]`.

2. **Are there any constraints on `n`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 1000`

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to construct the array such that for every triplet of indices `(i, j, k)` where `i < k < j`, the property `nums[k] * 2 ≠ nums[i] + nums[j]` holds.

A divide-and-conquer approach can achieve this. The idea is we can generate the beautiful array by the following:
- Divide the array into two halves: one with odd indices and the other with even indices. Recursively build the solution for these halves and concatenate them.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `n` as input.
2. **Recursive Construction**:
   - If `n` is 1, return `[1]` as it's trivially a beautiful array.
   - Generate the array for `n//2` and `(n+1)//2`.
   - Construct the new array by positioning the `odds` and `evens` correctly:
     - Append `2*each element in smaller beautiful array - 1` for odd positions.
     - Append `2*each element in smaller beautiful array` for even positions.

Given this recursive approach, we avoid the condition where `nums[k] * 2 = nums[i] + nums[j]` automatically.

### Code

Here’s the implementation of the described approach in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var beautifulArray = function(n) {
    const memo = {};
    
    const construct = (size) => {
        if (memo[size]) return memo[size];
        
        if (size === 1) {
            return [1];
        }
        
        const result = [];
        
        // Generate odd part
        for (const num of construct(Math.floor((size + 1) / 2))) {
            result.push(2 * num - 1);
        }
        
        // Generate even part
        for (const num of construct(Math.floor(size / 2))) {
            result.push(2 * num);
        }
        
        memo[size] = result;
        return result;
    }
    
    return construct(n);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(beautifulArray(4)); // Output might be [1, 3, 2, 4] or any other valid beautiful array
console.log(beautifulArray(5)); // Output might be [1, 5, 3, 2, 4] or any other valid beautiful array
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach:
- **Initialization**: Constructing the array elements involves recursion that splits the problem into two smaller problems which leads to a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\). This accounts for the recursion depth and the operations required at each level.
- **Space Complexity**: Using memoization to store constructed arrays, which results in \(O(n)\) space.

This solution is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
