[Leetcode 1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1287)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that appears more than 25% of the time. You need to identify that integer.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any negative numbers in the array?
   **A:** No, based on the problem constraints all numbers are non-negative.
   
2. **Q:** Is it safe to assume that the input will always contain exactly one integer that meets the criteria?
   **A:** Yes, as per the problem statement, there will always be exactly one integer in the array that appears more than 25% of the time.
   
3. **Q:** Can we use additional data structures to solve the problem?
   **A:** Yes, you can use any data structure as long as you solve the problem efficiently.

### Strategy

Given that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, we can leverage this property to solve the problem efficiently using linear scanning:

1. Define the threshold as `n / 4`, where `n` is the length of the array. This will help us determine the minimum number of times an element must appear to be the one that appears more than 25% of the time.
2. Traverse the array while maintaining a count of the current element.
3. As soon as the count of an element exceeds the threshold, return that element.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where `n` is the length of the array since we are making a single pass through the array.

### Code

```javascript
function findSpecialInteger(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const threshold = Math.floor(n / 4);
    
    let currentCount = 1;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === arr[i - 1]) {
            currentCount++;
            if (currentCount > threshold) {
                return arr[i];
            }
        } else {
            currentCount = 1;
        }
    }
    
    // If reached here, it means the array size is 1
    return arr[0];
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 10];
console.log(findSpecialInteger(arr));  // Output: 6
```

This implementation sequentially iterates over the array while counting the occurrences of each element and checks if it exceeds 25% of the array length, which allows us to identify the required element efficiently.
