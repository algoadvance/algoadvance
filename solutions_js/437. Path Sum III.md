[Leetcode 437. Path Sum III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l437)
Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of a path?**
   - A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the subtree (including the starting node).
2. **Do paths need to be continuous?**
   - Yes, paths must be continuous sequences going downward.
3. **Can the tree contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the tree can contain negative values.
4. **Is an empty tree a valid input?**
   - Yes, an empty tree is valid and should return 0 as there would be no paths.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to traverse each node and initiate a sub-path check starting from each node.
2. **Path Sum Count**:
   - Use a recursive helper function to calculate the number of paths starting from a particular node.
3. **Combination of DFS and Prefix Sum**:
   - To efficiently count the sum, use prefix sum with a hashmap to store the cumulative sum, allowing quick calculation of the target path sums as we iterate.

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

var pathSum = function(root, targetSum) {
    const prefixSumCount = new Map();
    // Base case to handle sum from the root
    prefixSumCount.set(0, 1);

    function dfs(node, currentSum) {
        if (node === null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Include the current node's value to the current sum
        currentSum += node.val;

        // Number of paths that reach here with desired targetSum
        let result = prefixSumCount.get(currentSum - targetSum) || 0;

        // Update the map with the current path sum
        prefixSumCount.set(currentSum, (prefixSumCount.get(currentSum) || 0) + 1);

        // Recurse on left and right children
        result += dfs(node.left, currentSum);
        result += dfs(node.right, currentSum);

        // When backtrack, remove the current sum from the map
        // As we move to a different branch, the current path shouldn't be reused
        prefixSumCount.set(currentSum, prefixSumCount.get(currentSum) - 1);

        return result;
    }

    // Initial call from the root with sum 0
    return dfs(root, 0);
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once and performing operations with the hashmap is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), due to the space used by the hashmap to store the prefix sums. Additionally, the recursion stack can go as deep as O(H) where H is the height of the tree, leading to overall O(N) space if the tree is skewed.

By following these steps, we can efficiently find the number of paths that sum up to the given target value in a binary tree.
