[Leetcode 212. Word Search II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l212)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings `words`. Find all words on the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],
                ["e","t","a","e"],
                ["i","h","k","r"],
                ["i","f","l","v"]],
       words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]

Output: ["oath","eat"]
```

### Constraints:
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `board` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are diagonal moves allowed? (Typically not, based on adjacency rules mentioned.)
2. Can words overlap on the board?
3. Should we ignore words that canâ€™t be formed, or handle them differently?
4. Considering performance, should we use any specific data structures?

## Strategy
1. **Trie Construction**: Build a Trie from the given list of words. This allows us to efficiently search for prefixes and words.
2. **DFS Search**: Use Depth-first search (DFS) to explore each cell, checking all potential words that can be formed starting from that cell.
3. **Backtracking**: Use backtracking to revert the state after exploring a path.
4. **Optimization**: To avoid reprocessing, mark cells temporarily as visited.

## Code

```javascript
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = {};
    this.word = null; // Stores the complete word at the end of a branch
  }
}

function buildTrie(words) {
  let root = new TrieNode();
  for (let word of words) {
    let node = root;
    for (let char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) {
        node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
      }
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    node.word = word; // Mark the end of a word
  }
  return root;
}

function findWords(board, words) {
  let result = [];
  let root = buildTrie(words);
  
  function dfs(node, i, j) {
    if (node.word) {
      result.push(node.word);
      // To avoid duplicate entries
      node.word = null;
    }

    if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= board.length || j >= board[0].length || !node.children[board[i][j]]) {
      return;
    }

    let char = board[i][j];
    board[i][j] = '#'; // Mark the cell as visited

    // Explore the neighbors
    if (i > 0) dfs(node.children[char], i - 1, j);
    if (j > 0) dfs(node.children[char], i, j - 1);
    if (i < board.length - 1) dfs(node.children[char], i + 1, j);
    if (j < board[0].length - 1) dfs(node.children[char], i, j + 1);

    board[i][j] = char; // Backtrack
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
      if (root.children[board[i][j]]) {
        dfs(root.children[board[i][j]], i, j);
      }
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}

const board = [
  ["o","a","a","n"],
  ["e","t","a","e"],
  ["i","h","k","r"],
  ["i","f","l","v"]
];
const words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"];

console.log(findWords(board, words)); // Output: ["oath", "eat"]
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Trie Construction**: O(L) where `L` is the sum of the lengths of all words.
2. **DFS Search**: O(m * n * 4^L) where `L` is the maximum length of the word.

However, due to Trie pruning and efficient backtracking, the typical runtime is much less, especially with shorter words and a reasonably sized board.
