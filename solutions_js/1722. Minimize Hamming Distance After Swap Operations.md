[Leetcode 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1722)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `source` and `target`, and an array `allowedSwaps` where `allowedSwaps[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index `a` and index `b` of the array `source`. Note that you can swap elements multiple times and in any order.

The Hamming distance between two arrays of the same length is the number of positions where the elements are different.

Return the minimum Hamming distance between `source` and `target` after performing any number of swap operations on `source`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the length constraints for `source` and `target` arrays?
   - Are the values in `source` and `target` arrays guaranteed to be integers?
   
2. **AllowedSwaps Structure:**
   - Is `allowedSwaps` guaranteed to contain valid indices?
   
3. **Initial Condition:**
   - Are `source` and `target` guaranteed to be of equal length?

### Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** Utilize a union-find (disjoint set union, DSU) data structure to handle the connectivity defined by `allowedSwaps`.
2. **Grouping Indices:** Group the indices of `source` that can be swapped interchangeably using the union-find structure.
3. **Comparison:** Compare grouped indices of `source` with corresponding indices in `target`. Elements in the same group can be swapped freely, so we only need the multi-set comparison within each group.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialize Union-Find:**
   - Initialize the union-find data structure for `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the input arrays.

2. **Group Formation:**
   - For each pair in `allowedSwaps`, union the two indices.

3. **Group Collection:**
   - Collect indices into groups. Indices in the same connected component belong to the same group.

4. **Hamming Distance Calculation:**
   - For each group, calculate the number of elements that can be correctly matched after any number of swaps within that group.
   - Compute the Hamming distance by counting mismatched elements across all groups.

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** Each union/find operation is nearly constant time, \( \mathcal{O}(\alpha(n)) \), where \( \alpha \) is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Grouping Indices and Multi-set Comparison:** Linear in terms of the number of elements \( n \).

### Code Implementation

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(n) {
        this.parent = Array.from({length: n}, (_, index) => index);
        this.rank = new Array(n).fill(1);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);  // Path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
}

var minimumHammingDistance = function(source, target, allowedSwaps) {
    const n = source.length;
    const uf = new UnionFind(n);

    for (const [a, b] of allowedSwaps) {
        uf.union(a, b);
    }

    // Group indices by their root parent
    const groups = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const root = uf.find(i);
        if (!groups.has(root)) {
            groups.set(root, []);
        }
        groups.get(root).push(i);
    }

    let hammingDistance = 0;

    // Compare elements within each group
    for (const indices of groups.values()) {
        const countSource = new Map();
        const countTarget = new Map();

        for (const index of indices) {
            countSource.set(source[index], (countSource.get(source[index]) || 0) + 1);
            countTarget.set(target[index], (countTarget.get(target[index]) || 0) + 1);
        }

        for (const [num, count] of countSource.entries()) {
            const targetCount = countTarget.get(num) || 0;
            hammingDistance += Math.max(0, count - targetCount);
        }
    }

    return hammingDistance;
};

// Usage:
// console.log(minimumHammingDistance([1,2,3,4], [2,1,4,5], [[0,1],[2,3]]));
```
This code reads the input arrays and allowed swaps, creates groups of interchangeable indices using union-find, and then calculates the minimum Hamming distance by comparing multi-sets of grouped indices.
