[Leetcode 2039. The Time When the Network Becomes Idle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2039)
## Problem Statement

A network consisting of `n` servers, identified from `0` to `n-1`, has been established. The network is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates the existence of a direct connection between servers `u` and `v`. Initially, server `0` is a data server and all other servers are data-consuming servers.

Each consuming server periodically sends a data packet to the data server and waits for the data server's response before sending another packet. The communication between servers happens asynchronously, and a data-consuming server `i` (for `i != 0`) has a message interval `patience[i]`. Once an idle period (no packet in transit or waiting for response) is encountered for server `i`, it will start sending packets again only after `patience[i]` seconds.

We need to determine the time at which the network becomes idle. The network is said to become idle when all the consuming servers stop sending more packets.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Timing**: Given that a packet takes 1 second to travel each segment of an edge, does this timing include both sending and receiving?
2. **Patience Definition**: If the patience of a server is `p`, does it start the next packet `p` seconds after the last packet finishes, or does it send immediately but not any more until the time `p` passes?
3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any constraints on the minimum or maximum values for `n`, `edges`, or `patience`?
4. **Structure**: Is it guaranteed that the network is connected?

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Convert the `edges` array into an adjacency list for easier traversal.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Use BFS to find the shortest time for each server to communicate to the data server (server `0`).
3. **Packet Sending Mechanism**: For each server, calculate how frequently it sends packets until it becomes idle.
4. **Determine Idle Time**: Calculate the time when the last packet (from any server) finishes its round trip.

## Code

```javascript
function networkBecomesIdle(edges, patience) {
    const n = patience.length;
    const graph = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    
    // Building the adjacency list
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }
    
    // Function to find shortest distance from server 0 to all servers using BFS
    const shortestPathFromZero = () => {
        const dist = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
        const queue = [[0, 0]]; // [server, distance]
        dist[0] = 0;
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [current, d] = queue.shift();
            
            for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
                if (dist[neighbor] === Infinity) {
                    dist[neighbor] = d + 1;
                    queue.push([neighbor, d + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dist;
    };
    
    const dist = shortestPathFromZero();
    
    let maxIdleTime = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        const timeToReach = dist[i] * 2;
        const lastPacketSend = Math.floor((timeToReach - 1) / patience[i]) * patience[i];
        const idleTime = lastPacketSend + timeToReach;
        maxIdleTime = Math.max(maxIdleTime, idleTime);
    }
    
    return maxIdleTime + 1; // Plus 1 to move from "last transmission complete" to "idle state"
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction**: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
2. **BFS for Shortest Path**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (servers).
3. **Idle Time Calculation**: O(V).

Overall Time Complexity: O(V + E)

This ensures that the given algorithm is efficient and scalable for larger inputs while accurately calculating the time until the network becomes idle.
