[Leetcode 3178. Find the Child Who Has the Ball After K Seconds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3178)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `N` representing the number of children standing in a circle, numbered from `0` to `N-1`. Initially, the child `0` has a ball. After every second, the child holding the ball passes it to the next child in a clockwise direction.

Given an integer `K` representing the number of seconds after which you need to determine the child who has the ball, return the number of the child holding the ball after `K` seconds.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on N and K?**
   Typically, you would expect `N` and `K` to be positive integers. It would be helpful to know the maximum limits to choose a suitable approach.
   
2. **Is there any edge case handling required?**
   Consider cases where `N` is 1, which means the same child always holds the ball, regardless of `K`.
   
3. **Should we consider negative values or special inputs?**
   Negative values for `N` or `K` are usually outside of the normal problem constraints unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Circular Pattern:**
   After `K` seconds, the ball will simply be passed `K` times. Since the children are standing in a circle, passing the ball `K` times may wrap around, and can be computed using modular arithmetic.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   After each complete pass around all `N` children (i.e., every `N` passes), the ball will be back at the starting position. Therefore, the position after `K` seconds can be found using:
   \[
   \text{Position} = K \mod N
   \]

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - When `N` is `1`, the modulo operation doesn't change the initial holder.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) since finding the position using the modulo operation is a constant time operation irrespective of `N` or `K`.

Below is the JavaScript code to achieve this:

## Code

```javascript
function findChildWithBall(N, K) {
    if (N === 1) return 0;
    return K % N;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(findChildWithBall(5, 2));  // Output: 2
console.log(findChildWithBall(5, 7));  // Output: 2
console.log(findChildWithBall(5, 10)); // Output: 0
console.log(findChildWithBall(1, 100)); // Output: 0
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Special Case Handling:** 
   - If `N` is `1`, the ball will always be with the single child, regardless of `K`.
   
2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Using `K % N` to find the effective position of the ball after `K` seconds.

This solution ensures efficiency and correctness, making it robust for the given problem constraints.
