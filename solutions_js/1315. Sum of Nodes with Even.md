[Leetcode 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1315)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree rooted at `root`, which is a TreeNode that contains an integer value. The task is to return the sum of values of all nodes with an even-valued grandparent. A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the result if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, the sum should be 0.

2. **Are node values restricted to positive integers?**
   - Node values can be any integer, including negative values.

3. **Do we need to consider the node itself to be its grandparent?**
   - No, for a node to be counted, it must have a grandparent which is not itself.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal**: We will perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to visit each node. This will allow us to easily keep track of the parent and grandparent as we recurse through the tree.
  
2. **Check Grandparent Value**: For each node, if the grandparent exists and its value is even, we add the current node's value to the sum.
  
3. **Pass Information**: While traversing, we pass down information about the node's parent and grandparent to child nodes.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}

var sumEvenGrandparent = function(root) {
    // Helper function for DFS traversal
    const dfs = (node, parent, grandparent) => {
        if (!node) return 0;
        let sum = 0;
        if (grandparent && grandparent.val % 2 === 0) {
            sum += node.val;
        }
        // Recursively traverse left and right children
        sum += dfs(node.left, node, parent);
        sum += dfs(node.right, node, parent);
        return sum;
    }
    
    return dfs(root, null, null);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we need to visit all nodes.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, this could be `O(N)` for a skewed tree, while in a balanced tree, it will be `O(log N)`.

This solution ensures we efficiently calculate the sum of all nodes' values that have an even-valued grandparent by making a single pass through the binary tree.
