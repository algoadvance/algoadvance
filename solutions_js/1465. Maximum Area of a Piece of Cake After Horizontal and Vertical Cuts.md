[Leetcode 1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1465)
### Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular cake of size `h x w` and two arrays, `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where:

- `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the `ith` horizontal cut and similarly, and
- `verticalCuts[i]` is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the `ith` vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays. Since the answer can be a large number, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` be empty arrays?
   - Yes, they can be empty, meaning no cuts are made in that direction.

2. What are the maximum allowed values for `h` and `w`?
   - For this problem, it's safe to assume `h` and `w` can be as large as `10^9`.

3. What are the constraints on the number of cuts?
   - The number of cuts can be up to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Cuts**: Sort both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` to easily compute distances between consecutive cuts.

2. **Max Distance Calculation**:
    - For horizontal cuts, compute the maximum distance between consecutive cuts and also consider the edges (top and bottom of the cake).
    - For vertical cuts, compute the maximum distance between consecutive cuts and also consider the edges (left and right of the cake).

3. **Maximum Area**: The maximum area will be the product of the maximum horizontal and vertical distances. 

4. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7` as the final answer.

### Code

```javascript
function maxArea(h, w, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    
    // Sort the cuts
    horizontalCuts.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    verticalCuts.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Compute the maximum distance between consecutive horizontal cuts
    let maxHorDist = Math.max(horizontalCuts[0], h - horizontalCuts[horizontalCuts.length - 1]);
    for (let i = 1; i < horizontalCuts.length; i++) {
        maxHorDist = Math.max(maxHorDist, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1]);
    }
    
    // Compute the maximum distance between consecutive vertical cuts
    let maxVerDist = Math.max(verticalCuts[0], w - verticalCuts[verticalCuts.length - 1]);
    for (let i = 1; i < verticalCuts.length; i++) {
        maxVerDist = Math.max(maxVerDist, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1]);
    }
    
    // Calculate maximum area and return it modulo `10^9 + 7`
    return (BigInt(maxHorDist) * BigInt(maxVerDist)) % BigInt(MOD);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `horizontalCuts` requires `O(n log n)` time where `n` is the number of horizontal cuts.
- Sorting `verticalCuts` requires `O(m log m)` time where `m` is the number of vertical cuts.
- Calculating the maximum distance requires `O(n + m)` time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n + m log m)`.
