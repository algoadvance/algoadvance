[Leetcode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l104)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the structure of the tree node?
   - The binary tree node is defined as:
     ```javascript
     function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
       this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
       this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
       this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
     }
     ```

2. Can the tree be empty?
   - Yes, if the tree is empty, the maximum depth should be `0`.

3. Are the node values relevant to determining the depth?
   - No, the values stored in the nodes are irrelevant to determining the depth.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, we will use DFS as it is more straightforward for this kind of problem.

1. **DFS Approach**:
   - If the current node is `null`, the depth is `0`.
   - Recursively find the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - The depth of the current node is the greater of the depths of its subtrees plus `1`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the depth-first search approach.

```javascript
function maxDepth(root) {
    if (root === null) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
    const rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
    
    return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.

The space complexity will be `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case where the tree is completely unbalanced, the space complexity will be `O(n)`. In the best case, where the tree is completely balanced, the space complexity will be `O(log n)`.
