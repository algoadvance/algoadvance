[Leetcode 2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2965)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of n integers which is supposed to contain all integers from 1 to n. However, one number is missing and one number is repeated. Your task is to identify the missing number and the repeated number.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: Can the input array contain less than 2 elements?
   - Since we need at least two elements to have a missing and a repeated value, the minimum length of the array should be 2.

2. **Output Format**: Should the function return the values or print them?
   - Typically, such functions should return the values as an array `([repeated_number, missing_number])`.

3. **Input Validation**: Should we handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer elements)?
   - For simplicity, we assume the input is always valid as per the problem statement.

With these clarifications, let's move to the strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Sum and Sum of Squares Approach**:
   - Compute the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers: \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Compute the expected sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers: \( S_{n^2} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \).

2. **Actual Sums**:
   - Compute the actual sum (`actual_sum`) and actual sum of squares (`actual_sum_of_squares`) from the array.

3. **Equations**:
   - Let the repeated number be \( x \) and the missing number be \( y \).
   - From the differences between expected and actual sums, establish two equations:
     1. \( S_n - actual\_sum = y - x \) ==> Equation (1)
     2. \( S_{n^2} - actual\_sum\_of\_squares = y^2 - x^2 \)

4. **Solve the Equations**:
   - Use the equations to solve for the missing number and the repeated number.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function findMissingAndRepeated(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const S_n = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    const S_n2 = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6;
    
    let actual_sum = 0;
    let actual_sum_of_squares = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        actual_sum += num;
        actual_sum_of_squares += num * num;
    }
    
    const sum_diff = S_n - actual_sum;  // y - x
    const sum_of_squares_diff = S_n2 - actual_sum_of_squares;  // y^2 - x^2
    
    // y^2 - x^2 = (y - x)(y + x)
    const sum_xy = sum_of_squares_diff / sum_diff;  // y + x
    
    const missing_number = (sum_diff + sum_xy) / 2;
    const repeated_number = sum_xy - missing_number;
    
    return [repeated_number, missing_number];
}

// Example usage
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5];
console.log(findMissingAndRepeated(nums));  // Output should be [2, 3]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm involves several arithmetic operations and a single pass through the array, thus it runs in \(O(n)\) time.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for storing sums and differences.

This method ensures efficiency and clarity in solving the problem of finding the missing and repeated numbers in a list.
