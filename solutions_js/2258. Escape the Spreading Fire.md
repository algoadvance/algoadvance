[Leetcode 2258. Escape the Spreading Fire](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2258)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of integers `grid` where:
- `grid[i][j]` represents the state of the cell at coordinates `(i, j)`:
  - `0` is an empty cell,
  - `1` is a tree,
  - `2` is a burning tree.

You need to determine the minimum amount of time to reach the bottom-right corner, starting from the top-left corner, such that you do not catch fire. Fire spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) every minute. You cannot step on a burning tree or a burnt-out tree (a tree that was burning at some point in time).

Return the minimum amount of time to reach the bottom-right corner if it is possible to escape without burning. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move diagonally?**
   - No, you can only move up, down, left, or right.

2. **Is the fire spreading from all the burning trees simultaneously each minute?**
   - Yes, all the `2`s in the grid spread to adjacent cells each minute.

3. **Do we know the size limit for the grid?**
   - The problem constraints should specify this (normally it fits within typical LeetCode constraints, e.g., `50x50`).

4. **What happens if the starting or ending position is a `2`?**
   - It’s impossible to escape, so the result should be `-1`.

## Strategy

1. **Multi-source BFS for Fire Spread Time Calculation**:
   - Perform a BFS from all the cells containing `2` to calculate the time at which the fire reaches each cell.
   
2. **Binary Search to Find the Latest Safe Start Time**:
   - Use binary search to find the maximum delay you can wait at the start before moving such that you can still reach the destination without burning. For each midpoint of the binary search, execute a BFS to check if you can reach from the start to the end safely.

## Code

```javascript
function escapeFire(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]];

    const inBounds = (x, y) => x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < m && y < n;

    const fireTime = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    
    const fireQueue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 2) {
                fireTime[i][j] = 0;
                fireQueue.push([i, j]);
            }
        }
    }

    const spreadFire = () => {
        while (fireQueue.length) {
            const [x, y] = fireQueue.shift();
            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                if (inBounds(nx, ny) && grid[nx][ny] === 1 && fireTime[nx][ny] === Infinity) {
                    fireTime[nx][ny] = fireTime[x][y] + 1;
                    fireQueue.push([nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
    };

    spreadFire();

    const canEscape = (delay) => {
        const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
        const queue = [[0, 0, delay]];

        if (fireTime[0][0] <= delay) return false;

        while (queue.length) {
            const [x, y, t] = queue.shift();
            if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1) return true;

            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                if (inBounds(nx, ny) && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] === 1 && (fireTime[nx][ny] === Infinity || fireTime[nx][ny] > t + 1)) {
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    queue.push([nx, ny, t + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    };

    let left = 0, right = m * n, result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canEscape(mid)) {
            result = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Fire Spread Calculation**: O(m * n) – BFS propagation from initially burning trees.
- **Binary Search**: O(log(m * n)) – Binary search for the maximum delay.
- **Checking Escape Feasibility**: O(m * n) – BFS each time during binary search.

Overall Complexity: O(m * n * log(m * n)).
