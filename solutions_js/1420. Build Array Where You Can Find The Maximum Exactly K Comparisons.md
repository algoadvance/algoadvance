[Leetcode 1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1420)
## Problem Statement

Given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, return the number of ways to build an array `arr` of length `n` such that:

1. `arr[i]` is a positive integer and `1 <= arr[i] <= m`.
2. There are exactly `k` comparisons of the form `arr[j] > arr[i]` such that `j < i`.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the elements of the array required to be distinct?
   - The problem doesnâ€™t specify that the array needs to have distinct elements.
   
2. Can elements be repeated?
   - Yes, elements can be repeated as long as they are within the given range `1 <= arr[i] <= m`.

3. What does "k comparisons" mean exactly?
   - "k comparisons" means that there are exactly `k` places where a previous element is less than a current element as we traverse the array from left to right. Essentially, it refers to the number of times an element's value is larger than one of its predecessors.

## Strategy

We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. Here's the approach:

1. **DP Definition**:
   - `dp[i][j][l]`: Number of ways to build an array of length `i` where the maximum value is `j` and there are exactly `l` comparisons.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][0][0] = 1`: One way to have an empty array (with zero elements, zero max value, and zero comparisons).

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each position in the array, consider the possible values it can take:
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to the current maximum value:
       - `dp[i][max_val][k]` accumulates from `dp[i-1][max_val][k]`.
     - If `arr[i]` becomes a new maximum value:
       - `dp[i][new_max][k]` accumulates from `dp[i-1][prev_max][k-1]`.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result may be large, we continuously take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Result**:
   - Sum up all ways to build an array of length `n` with any maximum value `1 <= max_val <= m` and exactly `k` comparisons.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
const MOD = 1000000007;

function numOfArrays(n, m, k) {
    // Initialize DP array with 0's
    let dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () =>
        Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () =>
            Array(k + 1).fill(0)
        )
    );

    // Base case
    dp[0][0][0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let max_val = 1; max_val <= m; max_val++) {
            for (let comparisons = 1; comparisons <= k; comparisons++) {
                // Case 1: Current element is less than or equal to the current max.
                dp[i][max_val][comparisons] += dp[i - 1][max_val][comparisons] * max_val;
                dp[i][max_val][comparisons] %= MOD;

                // Case 2: Current element is a new maximum.
                for (let prev_max = 1; prev_max < max_val; prev_max++) {
                    dp[i][max_val][comparisons] += dp[i - 1][prev_max][comparisons - 1];
                    dp[i][max_val][comparisons] %= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Sum up the results for all maximum values.
    let result = 0;
    for (let max_val = 1; max_val <= m; max_val++) {
        result += dp[n][max_val][k];
        result %= MOD;
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m \times k \times m) = O(n \times m^2 \times k)\) due to the nested loops iterating through `n`, `m`, and `k`, and an extra inner loop for dealing with comparisons. This might be improved further by optimization techniques depending on the constraints.

However, this complexity should be feasible given the typical constraints in competitive programming platforms like LeetCode.
