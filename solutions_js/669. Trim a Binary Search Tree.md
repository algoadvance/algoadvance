[Leetcode 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l669)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree and two integers `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lie in the range `[low, high]`. The resulting binary search tree should still be a valid binary search tree. The root can be changed as needed. Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the values for the nodes in the BST?**
   - The values for the nodes are within the range of signed integers.
  
2. **Are `low` and `high` inclusive?**
   - Yes, the range `[low, high]` is inclusive.

3. **What should be returned if the resulting BST is empty?**
   - If the resulting tree is empty, return `null`.

4. **Is it guaranteed that `low` is less than or equal to `high`?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that `low` â‰¤ `high`.

## Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - If the current node value is less than `low`, then we need to trim the left subtree and process the right subtree.
   - If the current node value is greater than `high`, then we need to trim the right subtree and process the left subtree.
   - If the current node value is within the range `[low, high]`, recursively trim both left and right subtrees.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} low
 * @param {number} high
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var trimBST = function(root, low, high) {
    // If the root is null, return null
    if (root === null) return null;

    // If the current node's value is less than low, trim the left subtree and move to the right subtree
    if (root.val < low) return trimBST(root.right, low, high);

    // If the current node's value is greater than high, trim the right subtree and move to the left subtree
    if (root.val > high) return trimBST(root.left, low, high);

    // If the current node's value is within the range, recursively trim left and right subtrees
    root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
    root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high);

    return root;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary search tree, because in the worst case, we might need to visit every node.
  
- The space complexity is **O(log n)** for the recursion stack in the average case (balanced tree) and **O(n)** in the worst case (completely skewed tree).
