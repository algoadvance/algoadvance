[Leetcode 2055. Plates Between Candles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2055)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of characters '*' and '|', where '*' represents a plate and '|' represents a candle. Also given an array `queries` where each query is a set of two numbers `[left, right]` representing a substring of `s`. For each query, we need to determine how many plates are between the leftmost and rightmost candles within the substring delimited by `left` and `right`.

### Example
Input: 
```javascript
s = "**|**|***|"
queries = [[2, 5], [5, 9]]
```

Output:
```javascript
[2, 3]
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= left <= right < s.length`

## Strategy

1. **Precomputation**: 
   - To make the query operations efficient, we should precompute:
     - The nearest '|' candle to the left of each position.
     - The nearest '|' candle to the right of each position.
     - A prefix sum array to count the number of '*' plates up to each position.
   
2. **Query Execution**:
   - For each query, using the precomputed arrays, identify the range within the substring `[left, right]` that is actually between two '|' candles.
   - Use the prefix sum array to quickly count the number of '*' plates between these two positions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if there are no candles within the given range in a query?
   - Return `0` if there are no candles within the given range, as there can't be any plates between the candles.

2. Should we assume the input string and queries are always valid as per constraints?
   - Yes.

3. Can the input string and queries be processed independently or should they be handled cumulatively?
   - Input string should be processed first for precomputations, then handle each query independently based on precomputed data.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function platesBetweenCandles(s, queries) {
    const n = s.length;
    
    const leftCandle = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    const rightCandle = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    const prefixPlates = new Array(n).fill(0);
  
    // Fill leftCandle
    for (let i = 0, candle = -1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] === '|') candle = i;
        leftCandle[i] = candle;
    }
    
    // Fill rightCandle
    for (let i = n - 1, candle = -1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (s[i] === '|') candle = i;
        rightCandle[i] = candle;
    }
    
    // Fill prefixPlates
    for (let i = 0, count = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] === '*') count += 1;
        prefixPlates[i] = count;
    }
    
    const result = [];
    for (const [left, right] of queries) {
        const leftIndex = rightCandle[left];
        const rightIndex = leftCandle[right];
        
        if (leftIndex === -1 || rightIndex === -1 || leftIndex >= rightIndex) {
            result.push(0);
        } else {
            result.push(prefixPlates[rightIndex] - prefixPlates[leftIndex]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
const s = "**|**|***|";
const queries = [[2, 5], [5, 9]];
console.log(platesBetweenCandles(s, queries));  // Output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Precomputation**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.
- **Query Execution**: \(O(1)\) per query using precomputed arrays.

Given that we might have up to \(10^5\) queries and a string of length up to \(10^5\), our solution is efficient with a total complexity of \(O(n + m)\) where \(m\) is the number of queries.
