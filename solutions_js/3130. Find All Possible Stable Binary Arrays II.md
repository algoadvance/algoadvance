[Leetcode 3130. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3130)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `original` and an array `target`, each consisting of only the integers `0` and `1`, return `true` if it is possible to make array `original` equal to array `target`, or `false` otherwise. You can do either of the following operations on the array `original`:

1. Swap adjacent elements.
2. Repeat the above operation any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the length of `original` and `target` are always same?**
   - Yes, it's given that both arrays will have the same length.

2. **Are there any constraints on the lengths of the arrays?**
   - The constraints aren't specified explicitly, but typical constraints apply for coding interview problems.

3. **Is there any time complexity we should strive to achieve?**
   - Generally, a linear or linear-logarithmic time complexity solution is preferable.

## Strategy

The core observation here is that if it's possible to sort the original array to match the target array using adjacent swaps, it implies that both arrays must contain the same number of `0`s and `1`s, and the relative order can be reshuffled using swaps.

Therefore, the steps we can take to solve the problem are:

1. **Count Matching:** Check if both arrays have the same number of `0`s and `1`s.
2. **Return Result:** If the counts match, return true as it's possible to match them through swapping; otherwise, return false.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function canTransform(original, target) {
    if (original.length !== target.length) return false;

    let countZeroOriginal = 0;
    let countOneOriginal = 0;
    
    let countZeroTarget = 0;
    let countOneTarget = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
        if (original[i] === 0) countZeroOriginal++;
        else countOneOriginal++;
        
        if (target[i] === 0) countZeroTarget++;
        else countOneTarget++;
    }
    
    return (countZeroOriginal === countZeroTarget) && (countOneOriginal === countOneTarget);
}

// Example test cases
console.log(canTransform([0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]));  // Output: true
console.log(canTransform([1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]));  // Output: true
console.log(canTransform([1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]));  // Output: false
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input arrays. This is because we iterate through the arrays once to count the number of `0`s and `1`s.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we're using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and scales well with the size of the input arrays.
