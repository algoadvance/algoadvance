[Leetcode 3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3016)
### Problem Statement
You are given a keyboard with 26 lowercase letters 'a'-'z' arranged in a specific layout, and a word that you need to type using this keyboard. You can only move between connected keys (left, right, up, down) and each movement takes one unit of time. Given the keyboard layout as a 2D grid and the target word, find the minimum number of movements required to type the word.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the dimensions of the keyboard grid?**
   - The dimensions would typically be specified in the problem or are assumed to be standard (e.g., 3x10, 5x5, etc.)
   
2. **Can the dimensions vary?**
   - Yes, dimensions can vary. For example:
     - 3 rows of 10 columns: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` represented as a 3x10 grid.
     - 5 rows of 5 columns: `'abcdefghijklmnoqrstuvwxyz'` represented as a 5x5 grid.

3. **Is wrapping around allowed?**
   - Usually, wrapping around (moving from the end of one row to the start of another) is not allowed unless explicitly stated.

4. **Is the grid always completely filled with all 26 letters?**
   - Yes, the grid will always contain all 26 letters.

### Strategy
1. **Grid Position Mapping**: Create a mapping from each character to its position in the grid.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the shortest path from one character to another in the grid.
3. **Short Path Computation**:
    - Initialize total movements to 0.
    - Start at the first character of the word, then find the shortest path to the next character, adding the path length to the total.
    - Repeat for all subsequent characters in the word.

### Code
```javascript
function minPushesToType(grid, word) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    const positions = {};

    // Map each character to its position in the grid
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            positions[grid[r][c]] = [r, c];
        }
    }

    const bfs = (start, end) => {
        let queue = [[...start, 0]];
        let visited = new Set();
        visited.add(start.toString());

        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [currentRow, currentCol, distance] = queue.shift();

            if (currentRow === end[0] && currentCol === end[1]) {
                return distance;
            }

            for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
                const newRow = currentRow + dr;
                const newCol = currentCol + dc;

                if (
                    newRow >= 0 && newRow < rows &&
                    newCol >= 0 && newCol < cols &&
                    !visited.has([newRow, newCol].toString())
                ) {
                    visited.add([newRow, newCol].toString());
                    queue.push([newRow, newCol, distance + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return Infinity; // Shouldn't reach here if the grid is well-defined
    };

    let totalPushes = 0;
    let currentPos = positions[word[0]];

    for (let i = 1; i < word.length; i++) {
        const nextPos = positions[word[i]];
        totalPushes += bfs(currentPos, nextPos);
        currentPos = nextPos;
    }

    return totalPushes;
}

// Example usage
const keyboardGrid = [
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'],
    ['k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't'],
    ['u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '0', '0', '0', '0']
];

const wordToType = "leetcode";
console.log(minPushesToType(keyboardGrid, wordToType)); // Output: Minimum movements required to type "leetcode"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Grid Mapping**: `O(rows * cols)`, where `rows` and `cols` are the dimensions of the grid.
- **BFS Search**: `O(rows * cols)` in the worst case for each character transition in the word.
- **Overall Complexity**: For word length `n`, the complexity is `O(n * rows * cols)`.

This methodology should provide an efficient way to calculate the minimum number of pushes required to type the given word.
