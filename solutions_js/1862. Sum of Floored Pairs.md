[Leetcode 1862. Sum of Floored Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1862)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of floor(`nums[i] / nums[j]`) for all pairs of indices `0 <= i, j < nums.length`. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 5, 9]
Output: 10
Explanation:
floor(2/5) = 0
floor(2/9) = 0
floor(5/2) = 2
floor(5/9) = 0
floor(9/2) = 4
floor(9/5) = 1
Sum of floored pairs = 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 7
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Duplicates:** Are there duplicates allowed in the array?
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.
2. **Size of Array:** What is the maximum size of the array?
   - The array can have up to `10^5` elements.
3. **Range of Values:** What is the range of values in the array?
   - Each element can be between `1` and `10^5`.

## Strategy
1. **Naive O(n^2) Approach**: The naive approach would involve iterating through each pair `(i, j)` and calculating `floor(nums[i] / nums[j])`. This, however, would be inefficient for larger arrays due to its O(n^2) complexity.
   
2. **Optimized Approach Using Counting**: Utilize counting and prefix sum to achieve a more efficient solution.
   - Create a frequency array to count occurrences of each number.
   - Use prefix sums to determine the number of elements up to any given value.
   - Use these counts to compute the sum efficiently by iterating through possible denominators and numerators.

## Code
Here's the optimized code to achieve this:

```javascript
var sumOfFlooredPairs = function(nums) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    const count = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);
    
    nums.forEach(num => count[num]++);

    const prefixSum = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 1; i <= maxNum; i++) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + count[i];
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= maxNum; i++) {
        if (count[i] === 0) continue;
        
        for (let j = i; j <= maxNum; j += i) {
            let upper = Math.min(j + i - 1, maxNum);
            result = (result + count[i] * (prefixSum[upper] - prefixSum[j - 1]) * Math.floor(j / i)) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Counting:** Creating the count array takes O(n) time.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** Building the prefix sum array takes O(maxNum) time.
- **Sum Calculation:** The nested loops iterate in such a way that each value is considered a limited number of times, making the complexity effectively O(n log n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) which is efficient for large input sizes up to 100,000.
