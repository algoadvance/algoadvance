[Leetcode 2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2336)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2336: Smallest Number in Infinite Set

Design a class `SmallestInfiniteSet` that represents a set containing all positive integers:

- The class should have methods to:
  - Retrieve the smallest integer from the set and remove it.
  - Add a positive integer back into the set.

Implement the `SmallestInfiniteSet` class:

- `SmallestInfiniteSet()` Initializes the object with numbers from 1 to infinity.
- `int popSmallest()` Removes and returns the smallest integer contained in the infinite set.
- `void addBack(int num)` Adds a positive integer `num` back into the infinite set if it is not already present.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there constraints on the range of numbers that could be manipulated?
   - **A:** We need to handle up to the range of positive integers reasonably, but mainly those used during the operations.

2. **Q:** Is there a concern for large number handling or efficiency regarding very high positive integers?
   - **A:** The main focus should be on the efficiency of typical operations, especially for smaller numbers since operations are more frequent there.

3. **Q:** Can `addBack` add multiple numbers?
   - **A:** No, it only adds one number at a time, and only if it is not currently in the set.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Keep track of the smallest number that is yet to be popped using a simple counter starting from 1.
   
2. **Managing Popped and Added Back Numbers**:
   - Use a Min-Heap (or Priority Queue) to manage the re-added numbers efficiently so as to always retrieve and pop the smallest number in `O(log N)` time.

### Code

```javascript
class SmallestInfiniteSet {
    constructor() {
        this.currentSmallest = 1;
        this.addedBackNumbers = new Set();
        this.minHeap = new MinHeap();
    }

    popSmallest() {
        if (this.minHeap.size() > 0) {
            let smallest = this.minHeap.pop();
            this.addedBackNumbers.delete(smallest);
            return smallest;
        } else {
            return this.currentSmallest++;
        }
    }

    addBack(num) {
        if (num < this.currentSmallest && !this.addedBackNumbers.has(num)) {
            this.minHeap.push(num);
            this.addedBackNumbers.add(num);
        }
    }
}

class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    push(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this._heapifyUp();
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.size() === 1) return this.heap.pop();
        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this._heapifyDown();
        return min;
    }

    _heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[parentIndex] <= this.heap[index]) break;
            [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }

    _heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[index];

        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild < element) swap = leftChildIndex;
            }

            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
                if (
                    (swap === null && rightChild < element) ||
                    (swap !== null && rightChild < leftChild)
                ) swap = rightChildIndex;
            }

            if (swap === null) break;

            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **popSmallest()**: `O(log N)` due to heap operations, where N is the number of elements in the heap.
- **addBack(num)**: `O(log N)` due to heap operations for insertion. Checking the element in the set is `O(1)`.
- **constructor()**: `O(1)` for initializing the set and heap.
