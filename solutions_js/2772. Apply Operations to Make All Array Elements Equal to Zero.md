[Leetcode 2772. Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2772)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. In one operation, you can choose any non-zero element `nums[i]` and integer `x` such that `1 <= x <= nums[i]`, and subtract `x` from `nums[i]` and add `x` to any other element `nums[j]` (where `i != j`).

Your task is to return `true` if you can make all the array elements equal to zero, or `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
One possible way to do it: 
1- choose element `3`, subtract 1 and add 1 to the second element, so the array becomes `[2, 2, 2]`.
2- choose element `2`, subtract 2 and add 2 to another `2`, so the array becomes `[0, 4, 0]`.
3- choose element `4`, subtract 4, and add 4 to the other `0`, so the array becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the `nums` array (size, maximum value of elements etc.)?
2. Can we assume that the array contains only non-negative integers?
3. Are there any scenarios where the exact same logic of operations should be applied in a specific order?

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Parity:** 
    - The typical insight here is to consider whether the sum of the array is zero. If sum is greater than zero, distribute that sum back into zero through valid operations.
    - If the total sum of numbers is zero, we can redistribute non-zero elements into others. If not, we cannot make all zeros.

2. **Sum Analysis:** 
    - If the sum of array elements is zero, we should return `true` because we can always redistribute the sum back into zero whether selectively or comprehensively, always reducing every term.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Compute the sum of all elements in the given array `nums`.
    - If the sum is zero, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of computing the sum of elements is, \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canMakeAllZero = function(nums) {
    let sum = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        sum += num;
    }

    return sum === 0;
};

// Example usage
let nums = [3, 1, 2];
console.log(canMakeAllZero(nums)); // Output: true
```

**Explanation:**
1. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
2. Check if the sum is zero.
    - If yes, return `true` because we can make all elements zero.
    - If no, return `false` because it is not possible to make every element zero.
