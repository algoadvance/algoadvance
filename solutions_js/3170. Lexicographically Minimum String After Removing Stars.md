[Leetcode 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3170)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters and stars `*`. In one operation, you can choose any star in `s` and remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the lexicographically minimum string you can obtain by applying the given operation any number of times.

## Example
```
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"

Input: s = "erase*****"
Output: ""
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?** 
   - No, the prompt guarantees a non-empty string.

2. **Are all operations performed simultaneously or sequentially?**
   - They are performed sequentially, so the string state changes with each operation.

3. **Is there a guaranteed star character to the right of each removable non-star character?**
   - Yes, every star `*` will remove its closest non-star character to its left.

## Strategy

1. Use a stack to solve this problem. The stack will help us keep track of the characters that remain in the resulting string.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - If the character is a letter, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a star, pop the last character from the stack if the stack is not empty.
3. Convert the stack back to a string. The characters in the stack will be the result.

## Code

```javascript
function removeStars(s) {
    const stack = [];
    for (const ch of s) {
        if (ch === '*') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(ch);
        }
    }
    return stack.join('');
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string once and perform O(1) operations (push/pop) on the stack for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since in the worst case, all characters are letters and they are stored in the stack.
