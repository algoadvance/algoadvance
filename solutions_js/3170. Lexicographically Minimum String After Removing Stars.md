[Leetcode 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3170)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, which contains only lowercase letters and the character `*`, you need to remove all the stars from the string. Each `*` character in the string erases the closest character to its left and itself. Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest possible string after performing all the star removals.

Example:
```javascript
Input: s = "leet**cod*e"
Output: "lecoe"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple adjacent `*` characters?
   - Yes, each `*` should remove the closest character to its left.
2. What should happen if there's a `*` at the beginning of the string?
   - Any `*` at the beginning will only affect the subsequent valid characters to its right. No additional effect beyond this explanation.

## Strategy

1. Use a stack to process the characters in the string.
2. Traverse the string character by character:
   - If the current character is a lowercase letter, push it onto the stack.
   - If the current character is a `*`, pop the top element from the stack (if the stack is not empty).
3. At the end of traversing the string, the stack will contain the desired characters.
4. Convert the stack back into a string and return it.

## Code

```javascript
function removeStars(s) {
    let stack = [];

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '*') {
            if (stack.length > 0) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }

    return stack.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(removeStars("leet**cod*e")); // Output: "lecoe"
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string once.
- The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as we might need to store all characters in the stack if there are no `*` characters.

This approach ensures that the problem is addressed efficiently while keeping the solution straightforward and easy to understand.
