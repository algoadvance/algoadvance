[Leetcode 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1342)
## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = 123
Output: 12
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `num` be zero initially?
   - Yes, if `num` is zero, the output should be `0` since no steps are needed to reduce it.
   
2. Is there any upper constraint on the value of `num`?
   - Not specified, but assume typical 32-bit integer range, which is practical for most uses.

## Strategy
We will implement a function that iterates through the reduction process as described:
- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the current number is odd, subtract 1 from it.
- Count each operation and return the count when `num` reaches zero.

## Code
Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfSteps = function(num) {
    let steps = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 === 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else {
            num -= 1;
        }
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfSteps(14));  // Output: 6
console.log(numberOfSteps(8));   // Output: 4
console.log(numberOfSteps(123)); // Output: 12
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is `O(log n)`:
- In the worst case for large `num`, we divide it by 2 in each even step, reducing the problem size logarithmically.
- Subtracting 1 (for odd numbers) also logs the number of operations since each subtraction is followed by potential division steps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the given number.
