[Leetcode 2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2382)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an array `removeQueries`, both are of length `n`. For the `i-th` query, the value at `nums[removeQueries[i]]` is removed from `nums`. If the j-th index remains unremoved, then `nums[j]` counts toward the segment sum of the array. The goal is to return an array `result` of length `n` where `result[i]` is the maximum segment sum of the array after applying the first `i+1` queries.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be duplicate values in `removeQueries`?**
   - No, each query represents a unique position to remove, so there wonâ€™t be duplicate indices to remove.

2. **What kind of values does `nums` contain, only positive?**
   - `nums` can contain any integer values including negative numbers.

3. **How should we handle summing the segments if the array is entirely removed at some point?**
   - If all elements are removed and the array is empty, the segment sum is `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We need to keep track of active segments and the maximum segment sum dynamically as the elements are removed.
   - Use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) (or Union-Find) data structure for dynamically managing the segments efficiently.

2. **Steps:**
   - Iterate through `removeQueries` in reverse order. This allows us to "add" elements back and build the segments progressively.
   - Use a `parents` array for union-find to manage the segments and a `size` array to store the sums of the segments.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - **Union-Find Operations:** `find` and `union` functions to manage segment merges.
   - **Tracking Segments:** Maintain a maximum segment sum during each step of the addition process.
   - Initialize all possible segment sums as `0` and update the sums as we handle additions.
   - Collect results in reverse to align with the removal order.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - Union-Find operations (`find` and `union`) are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank: O(log* n), where log* is the iterated logarithm.

Below is the JavaScript implementation:

### Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = new Array(size);
        this.size = new Array(size);
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            this.parent[i] = i;
            this.size[i] = 0; // Initially, sizes are 0 as they are not yet active
        }
    }
    
    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]); // Path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }
    
    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);
        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            this.parent[rootX] = rootY; // Join x's root to y's root
            this.size[rootY] += this.size[rootX]; // Update the size
        }
    }
}

var maximumSegmentSum = function(nums, removeQueries) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let result = new Array(n).fill(0);
    let active = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let uf = new UnionFind(n);
    let maxSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let idx = removeQueries[i];
        active[idx] = true;
        uf.size[idx] = nums[idx]; // Initialize the segment size
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, uf.size[idx]); // Update initial maxSum
        
        // Union with neighbors if they are active
        if (idx > 0 && active[idx - 1]) {
            let rootBefore = uf.find(idx - 1);
            uf.union(idx, idx - 1);
        }
        if (idx < n - 1 && active[idx + 1]) {
            let rootAfter = uf.find(idx + 1);
            uf.union(idx, idx + 1);
        }

        // Always update maxSum to consider new union results
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, uf.size[uf.find(idx)]);
        result[i] = maxSum;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

This code computes the maximum segment sum efficiently by leveraging the Union-Find data structure to handle dynamic segment merges and updates.
