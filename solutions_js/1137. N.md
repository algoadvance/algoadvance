[Leetcode 1137. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1137)
## Problem Statement
The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows: 

- T(0) = 0
- T(1) = 1
- T(2) = 1
- T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3) for n >= 3

Given `n`, return the value of T(n).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input range?**
   - The input `n` is a non-negative integer which can vary from 0 to around 37.
   
2. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, the input will always be a non-negative integer.

3. **What is the expected output?**
   - The output should be the n-th number in the Tribonacci sequence.

## Strategy
1. **Base Cases:**
   - For `n == 0`, return 0.
   - For `n == 1`, return 1.
   - For `n == 2`, return 1.

2. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - Use an iterative approach (one-pass) starting from `T(3)` up to `T(n)`. 
   - Maintain a sliding window of the last three Tribonacci numbers to save memory.

### Code
```javascript
function tribonacci(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
    
    let x = 0, y = 1, z = 1;
    
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        let sum = x + y + z;
        x = y;
        y = z;
        z = sum;
    }
    
    return z;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(tribonacci(4));  // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(n)** because we only iterate through the sequence once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size \( n \).

This solution is efficient and should work well within the constraints of typical inputs.
