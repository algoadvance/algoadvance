[Leetcode 3145. Find Products of Elements of Big Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3145)
### Problem Statement

You have an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. You need to find the product of every `k` consecutive elements of the array and return an array of these products.

For example:
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: [6, 24, 60]
```
The output array `[6, 24, 60]` corresponds to the products of `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[3, 4, 5]` respectively.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the behavior if `k` is larger than the length of `arr`?** 
   - Generally, if `k` is larger than the length of the array, we can assume that no subsequence of `k` consecutive elements exists, so the output would be an empty array.

2. **Are the elements of `arr` always integers?**
   - Yes, itâ€™s given that the elements are integers.

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers and zeros.

4. **What is the expected output if `k` is 1?**
   - If `k` is 1, then the output should be the same as the input array.

### Strategy

To generate the required output, we can use a sliding window approach:

1. **Initialize a variable to store the product of the first `k` elements.**
2. **Slide the window one element at a time while updating the product.**
   - To do this efficiently, divide by the element that is sliding out of the window and multiply by the element that is sliding into the window.
3. **Collect the resulting products.**
4. **Return the array of products.**

### Time Complexity

- **Initial product computation:** O(k)
- **Sliding window updates:** O(n-k)
  
Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.

### Code

```javascript
function findProducts(arr, k) {
    if (k > arr.length) {
        return [];
    }
    
    let result = [];
    let product = 1;
    
    // Calculate the product of the first k elements
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        product *= arr[i];
    }
    
    // Add the initial product to the result array
    result.push(product);
    
    // Use sliding window to find the rest of the products
    for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        product = product / arr[i - k] * arr[i];
        result.push(product);
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findProducts([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3));  // Output: [6, 24, 60]
console.log(findProducts([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1));  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(findProducts([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6));  // Output: []
```

By using this approach, we efficiently compute the products of consecutive elements without repeatedly recalculating from scratch, leading to an optimal solution.
