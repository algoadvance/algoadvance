[Leetcode 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2108)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string `""`.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Types:**
   - What are the constraints on the input? For example, can there be any non-alphabetic characters in the strings, or is there a limit to the length of each string?
   
   **Response:** The constraints are generally manageable string lengths and alphabetic characters are used.

2. **Output Types:**
   - Is it guaranteed that the array will not be empty?

   **Response:** For this problem, assume the array can have zero or more strings. If the array is empty, the function should return an empty string.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Over the Array:**
   - Loop through each string in the `words` array.

2. **Check Palindromicity:**
   - For each string, check if it is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards (i.e., `str === str.split('').reverse().join('')`).

3. **Return the First Palindromic String:**
   - If a palindromic string is found, return it immediately.
   - If the loop ends with no palindromic string found, return an empty string `""`.

### Code

```javascript
function firstPalindrome(words) {
    for (let word of words) {
        if (isPalindrome(word)) {
            return word;
        }
    }
    return "";
}

function isPalindrome(s) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = s.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] !== s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["notapalindrome", "racecar", "level"];
console.log(firstPalindrome(words));  // Output: "racecar"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iteration through the array:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of strings.
- **Palindrome Check:** Each palindrome check involves checking the characters from both ends of the string towards the center, which is `O(m/2)` where `m` is the length of the string. This can be considered `O(m)` for simplicity.

Combining these, if `m` is the average length of the words:
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n * m)`
