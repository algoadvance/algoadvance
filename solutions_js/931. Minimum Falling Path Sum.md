[Leetcode 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l931)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 931: **Minimum Falling Path Sum**

Given a square array of integers `matrix`, return the minimum sum of any falling path through `matrix`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is different but directly below: i.e., from column `j - 1`, `j`, or `j + 1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are two falling paths with a minimum sum as shown:
[[2], [5], [6]]
[[2], [6], [5]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = [[-19,57],[-40,-5]]
Output: -59
Explanation: The falling path with a minimum sum is shown:
[[-19], [-40]]
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarify the input format**:
   - Input is a 2D array of integers with constraints specified.
2. **Boundary conditions**:
   - Ensure the solution works for the smallest matrix (`1x1`).

### Strategy

We will use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** for this problem. The idea is to construct a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at row `i` and column `j`. 

The DP transition will proceed as follows:
1. Copy the first row of the matrix to the first row of the DP table (since there are no rows above the first row).
2. For each cell in rows below the first row, we will calculate the minimum falling path sum by taking the minimum of the sums of allowed transitions (from the directly above, above-left, and above-right cells).

### Code
Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function minFallingPathSum(matrix) {
    const n = matrix.length;
    // Initialize dp array with the first row of the matrix
    const dp = Array.from(matrix);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            let minAbove = dp[i - 1][j];
            if (j > 0) {
                minAbove = Math.min(minAbove, dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
            }
            if (j < n - 1) {
                minAbove = Math.min(minAbove, dp[i - 1][j + 1]);
            }
            dp[i][j] += minAbove;
        }
    }
    
    // The result is the minimum value in the last row of dp array
    return Math.min(...dp[n - 1]);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` because we iterate over each element in the matrix exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` additional space (not counting input matrix). We use the same matrix for our DP transitions to minimize space usage.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize the DP array with the first row of the matrix.
2. **DP Transition**:
   - For every cell from the second row onwards (`matrix[i][j]`), compute the minimum falling path sum by considering the allowed transitions from the row above.
3. **Result**:
   - The minimum value in the last row of the DP table gives the minimum falling path sum.

This completes the JavaScript solution for the Minimum Falling Path Sum problem.
