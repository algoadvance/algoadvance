[Leetcode 164. Maximum Gap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l164)
### Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array, you are required to find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form. You should try to solve it in linear time (`O(n)`) and use linear extra space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values in the array?**
   - The values are typical integer ranges.
   
2. **Can the array be empty or have fewer than two elements?**
   - If the array contains fewer than two elements, the function should return 0.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values within the input array?**
   - No specific constraints are provided, assume typical integer value constraints for algorithm complexity analysis.

### Strategy
To achieve linear time complexity, the following strategy can be used:

1. **Handle Edge Case:** If the input array has fewer than two elements, return 0 as thereâ€™s no pair of elements to calculate the gap.
2. **Find Minimum and Maximum Values:** Compute the minimum and maximum values of the array. These will help in determining the bucket size.
3. **Bucket Sort (Divide and Conquer):**
   - Compute the minimum possible maximum gap using `(max - min) / (n - 1)` which is the bucket size. This ensures that the maximum gap will not be between the values within the same bucket but between the maximum of one bucket and the minimum of the next bucket.
   - Create buckets to store the min and max values of numbers falling into each bucket.
   - Distribute the array elements into the buckets.
4. **Compute Maximum Gap:** Iterate through the buckets to find the maximum gap (maximum difference between the max of a previous bucket and the min of the current bucket).

### Code

```javascript
function maximumGap(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let minNum = Math.min(...nums);
    let maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    
    // Length of the array
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Calculate the bucket size
    const bucketSize = Math.max(1, Math.floor((maxNum - minNum) / (n - 1)));
    
    // Number of buckets
    const bucketCount = Math.floor((maxNum - minNum) / bucketSize) + 1;
    
    let buckets = Array(bucketCount).fill(null).map(() => ({ min: Infinity, max: -Infinity }));
    
    // Distribute the numbers into the buckets
    for (let num of nums) {
        let bucketIdx = Math.floor((num - minNum) / bucketSize);
        buckets[bucketIdx].min = Math.min(num, buckets[bucketIdx].min);
        buckets[bucketIdx].max = Math.max(num, buckets[bucketIdx].max);
    }
    
    // Calculate the maximum gap
    let maxGap = 0;
    let previousBucketMax = minNum;
    
    for (let bucket of buckets) {
        if (bucket.min === Infinity) {
            // Skip empty buckets
            continue;
        }
        
        maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, bucket.min - previousBucketMax);
        previousBucketMax = bucket.max;
    }
    
    return maxGap;
}

// Example usage
console.log(maximumGap([3, 6, 9, 1])); // Output: 3
console.log(maximumGap([10])); // Output: 0
console.log(maximumGap([])); // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array because:
  - Finding the minimum and maximum values of the array takes O(n) time.
  - Distributing elements into buckets takes O(n) time.
  - Iterating through buckets to find the maximum gap takes O(n) time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we use extra space for the buckets, which in the worst case can be up to O(n) buckets.
