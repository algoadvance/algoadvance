[Leetcode 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1727)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary matrix `matrix`, you can rearrange the columns of each row independently. The goal is to return the area of the largest submatrix that has only 1s.

### Example:
```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the second and third columns as follows to get the matrix:
 [[0,1,0],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,1,0]]
 The largest submatrix of 1s has an area of 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the matrix have different row and column lengths?**
   - No, the matrix is guaranteed to be rectangular.
2. **What is the range of dimensions for the matrix?**
   - The number of rows and columns is between 1 and 1000.
3. **Does the matrix contain only 0 and 1?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy
1. **Compute Heights:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, compute the number of consecutive 1s ending at that cell in that column.
   
2. **Sort Rows:**
   - For each row in the matrix, sort the heights in non-increasing order. This helps in forming the largest possible sub-matrix of all 1s by pressing columns together.
   
3. **Calculate Largest Area:**
   - For each row, after sorting the heights, calculate the possible area considering that row as the base (height of the sub-matrix). The area can be computed as `height * (number of 1s up to this point in the sorted list)`.

## Code
```javascript
function largestSubmatrix(matrix) {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    let height = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));

    // Step 1: Compute heights
    for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        let currentHeight = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === 1) {
                currentHeight++;
            } else {
                currentHeight = 0;
            }
            height[i][j] = currentHeight;
        }
    }

    let maxArea = 0;
    // Step 2: Sort rows and compute max area
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        // Sort heights of row i in non-increasing order
        height[i].sort((a, b) => b - a);

        // Compute the largest area with row `i` as the base
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            let currentArea = height[i][j] * (j + 1);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Height Calculation:** O(rows * cols) because each cell is processed once.
- **Row Sorting:** O(rows * cols * log(cols)) because each row is sorted independently.
- **Area Calculation:** O(rows * cols) because each cell's area is calculated.

So, the overall time complexity is **O(rows * cols * log(cols))**.
