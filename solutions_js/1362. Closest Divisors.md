[Leetcode 1362. Closest Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1362)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer num, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equals `num + 1` or `num + 2`.

Return the two integers in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's clarify certain details regarding the problem:
1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints or limits on the value of `num`?
2. **Output Requirements**: Should the pair of integers be returned in any specific order?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle edge cases, e.g., when `num` is very large or very small?

Assuming standard constraints similar to usual LeetCode problems, this is our proposed strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Input Understanding**: We are given a single integer `num`.
2. **Target Values**: We need to consider the products `num + 1` and `num + 2`.
3. **Factor Calculation**: For each target value, we need to find pairs of factors. We will start checking for factors from the square root of the target value down to 1. This ensures we get the closest pairs.
4. **Checking Order**: If a closer pair is found for `num + 1` compared to `num + 2`, we prioritize it due to lesser absolute difference.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function closestDivisors(num) {
    // Helper function to find the closest divisors for a given number
    const findClosestDivisors = (target) => {
        for (let i = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(target)); i > 0; i--) {
            if (target % i === 0) {
                return [i, target / i];
            }
        }
    };
    
    // Check for the closest divisors of num + 1
    const divisors1 = findClosestDivisors(num + 1);
    // Check for the closest divisors of num + 2
    const divisors2 = findClosestDivisors(num + 2);
    
    // Compare differences
    const diff1 = Math.abs(divisors1[0] - divisors1[1]);
    const diff2 = Math.abs(divisors2[0] - divisors2[1]);

    return diff1 < diff2 ? divisors1 : divisors2;
}

// Example usage
console.log(closestDivisors(8));   // Output could be [3, 3] or [4, 2]
console.log(closestDivisors(123)); // Output could be [11, 12]
console.log(closestDivisors(999)); // Output could be [25, 40]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding Divisors**: For each target value (`num + 1` and `num + 2`), we iterate from the square root of the target value down to 1. This gives us a time complexity of \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) for finding divisors.
- **Overall Complexity**: Since we need to do this twice (for `num + 1` and `num + 2`), the overall time complexity remains \( O(\sqrt{n}) \).

This approach ensures that we find the closest divisors in a computationally efficient manner.
