[Leetcode 1888. Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1888)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you are allowed to flip characters from `'0'` to `'1'` or from `'1'` to `'0'` any number of times. A binary string is alternating if no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"101"` are alternating, while the string `"000"` and `"111"` are not alternating.

Return the minimum number of flips required to make the binary string alternating.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of the string:** What is the typical or maximum length of the string `s`?
2. **Constraints on input:** Are there any constraints on the input, such as length limits or the characters present (always binary)?
3. **Efficiency requirements:** Is there any specific requirement for the time or space complexity of the solution?

For the purposes of this problem, let's assume:
- The string `s` consists only of characters `'0'` and `'1'`.
- The length of `s` can be up to 10^5.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Construct Possible Alternating Strings:**
   - Create two potential target alternating strings for comparison:
     - `alt1`: one starting with '0' (e.g., '010101...').
     - `alt2`: one starting with '1' (e.g., '101010...').

2. **Sliding Window Comparison:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of flips required to match either `alt1` or `alt2` for any subsequence of length equal to the length of the original string.

3. **Compute Flips for Substrings:**
   - Compare the input string with the two alternating patterns for each valid substring position using the sliding window and count mismatches.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute mismatches for the first window and then update the counts incrementally as the window slides, rather than recalculating from scratch.

### Code

```javascript
var minFlips = function(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const sDouble = s + s;  // Double the string to handle rotation easily.
    
    let alt1 = '', alt2 = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < sDouble.length; i++) {
        alt1 += i % 2 === 0 ? '0' : '1';
        alt2 += i % 2 === 0 ? '1' : '0';
    }
    
    let diff1 = 0, diff2 = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] !== alt1[i]) diff1++;
        if (s[i] !== alt2[i]) diff2++;
    }
    
    let minFlips = Math.min(diff1, diff2);
    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (sDouble[i - 1] !== alt1[i - 1]) diff1--;
        if (sDouble[i - 1] !== alt2[i - 1]) diff2--;
        
        if (sDouble[i + n - 1] !== alt1[i + n - 1]) diff1++;
        if (sDouble[i + n - 1] !== alt2[i + n - 1]) diff2++;
        
        minFlips = Math.min(minFlips, diff1, diff2);
    }
    
    return minFlips;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we create the doubled string in linear time and then use a sliding window approach to count mismatches over this string, which also operates in linear time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage for the doubled string and the two target alternating strings. This is linear with respect to the length of the input string.
