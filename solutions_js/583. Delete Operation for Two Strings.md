[Leetcode 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l583)
### Problem Statement

The problem is from LeetCode (Problem #583) titled "Delete Operation for Two Strings."

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of steps required to make `word1` and `word2` the same. In each step, you can delete one character in either string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What types of characters can the strings contain?**
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

2. **What are the length constraints for the input strings?**
   - The lengths of `word1` and `word2` can be between `1` and `500`.

3. **Are there any particular edge cases we should consider?**
   - Both strings are empty.
   - One string is a complete substring of another.
   - Both strings are already identical.

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of deletions to make both strings equal, we can reframe the problem using the concept of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):

1. **Identify the LCS of the two strings.** Any characters not in this subsequence must be deleted from both strings to make them equal.
2. **Calculate the LCS of the strings.** The LCS gives us the longest subsequence that is present in both strings.
3. **Determine the number of deletions.** If `len_LCS` is the length of the LCS, then the number of deletions required is:
   \[
   \text{Deletions} = (len(word1) - len_LCS) + (len(word2) - len_LCS)
   \]

The LCS calculation involves dynamic programming, which is efficiently achievable with time complexity \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.

### Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var minDistance = function(word1, word2) {
    let m = word1.length;
    let n = word2.length;
    
    // Creating a 2D array for memoization
    let dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Fill the dp array according to the LCS logic
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    let lcsLength = dp[m][n];
    
    // Calculate the minimum number of deletions
    return (m - lcsLength) + (n - lcsLength);
};

// Example usage
let word1 = "sea";
let word2 = "eat";
console.log(minDistance(word1, word2)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the length of `word1` and \(n\) is the length of `word2`. This is due to the nested loops used to fill the DP table.

The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) because of the DP table that we maintain to store the lengths of the LCS for substrings of `word1` and `word2`.
