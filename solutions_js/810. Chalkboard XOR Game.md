[Leetcode 810. Chalkboard XOR Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l810)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` representing the numbers on a chalkboard. Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If removing a number causes the XOR of all the remaining numbers to become zero, the player who removed that number wins. If the XOR of all the numbers is initially zero, Alice wins immediately. Otherwise, the game continues until a player wins. If Alice wins with optimal play, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can `nums` be empty or contain negative numbers?**
   - A: The problem guarantees at least one number in `nums`, and it can contain negative numbers.

2. **Q: What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - A: The problem constraints typically have some upper bounds like 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 and -100000 <= nums[i] <= 100000.

3. **Q: What about the case where the array has only one element?**
   - A: If there is only one element, Alice will always win because she will remove the single element, and the XOR of an empty array is zero.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following insights:

1. **Initial XOR Check**: Compute the XOR of all elements in `nums`. If the result is zero, Alice wins immediately (return `true`).

2. **Array Length and Parity**:
    - If the number of elements in `nums` is even, Alice will always have a winning strategy.
    - If the number of elements in `nums` is odd, Bob can counter every move Alice makes, leading potentially to a losing strategy for Alice.

3. **Reasoning**: 
    - The reasoning behind using the length and parity is related to the ability to always force a move that balances the remaining array. Even lengths allow Alice to always force Bob into a position where he has no winning moves.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function xorGame(nums) {
    // Calculate the XOR of all elements
    let xorSum = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        xorSum ^= num;
    }

    // If the total XOR sum is zero, Alice wins immediately
    if (xorSum === 0) {
        return true;
    }

    // If the number of elements is even, Alice wins
    return nums.length % 2 === 0;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(xorGame([1, 1, 2])); // false
console.log(xorGame([0, 1]));    // true
console.log(xorGame([1, 1]));    // true
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial XOR Calculation**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Parity Check**: O(1), simply checking the length.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, making this algorithm efficient and suitable for the problem constraints.
