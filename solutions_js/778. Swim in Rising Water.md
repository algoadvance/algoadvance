[Leetcode 778. Swim in Rising Water](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l778)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

You are initially on the top left square `(0, 0)`, and you need to reach the bottom right square `(n-1, n-1)`.

In each step, you can either move up, down, left, or right. If the water level is rising uniformly, you can only swim in water at or below the current time `t`. The elevation of the grid represents the time in minutes that you have to wait before you can step on it.

Return the least time `t` at which you can reach the bottom right square.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid[0][0].
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-worker
ne� time�vel in grid�topologicalscan only increase.
At time 1, you can step on grid[1][0].
At time 2, you can step on grid[0][1].
At time 3, you can step on grid[1][1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation:
The final path is frozen groundwater to follow  gate
grid[0][0] -> grid[0][1] -> grid[0][2] -> grid[0][3]
-> grid[0][4] -> grid[1][4] -> grid[2][4] -> grid[hunh
34] -> grid[4][4]. The highest elevation in this path
is 16.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n * n`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the input grid always has a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner?
2. Are diagonal movements allowed? (The problem states only up, down, left, and right)
3. Do we need to handle any specific edge cases like extremely high elevation values or large grid sizes?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the Binary Search along with a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

### Steps:

1. **Binary Search**: We will perform a binary search on the `time` `t`, trying to find the minimum `t` such that we can reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner.

2. **Modified BFS/DFS**: For each midpoint in the binary search, we'll use BFS/DFS to check if we can traverse from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` with the current `t`.

3. **Determine Feasibility**: If we can reach the destination at the current `t`, then we try a smaller time. Otherwise, we try a larger time.

### Code

```javascript
function swimInWater(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const DIRS = [[0,1], [1,0], [0,-1], [-1,0]];
    
    const isValid = (row, col, t, visited) => {
        if (row < 0 || row >= n || col < 0 || col >= n) return false;
        if (visited[row][col]) return false;
        if (grid[row][col] > t) return false;
        return true;
    };

    const canReachEnd = (mid) => {
        const queue = [[0, 0]];
        const visited = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [x, y] = queue.shift();
            if (x === n - 1 && y === n - 1) return true;
            for (const [dx, dy] of DIRS) {
                const nx = x + dx;
                const ny = y + dy;
                if (isValid(nx, ny, mid, visited)) {
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    };

    let left = grid[0][0];
    let right = n * n - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canReachEnd(mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log(maxElevation)) where maxElevation is `n * n - 1`.
- **BFS/DFS**: O(n^2) for each feasibility check.
- Hence, the overall complexity is **O(n^2 log(n^2))**.
