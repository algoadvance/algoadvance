[Leetcode 1029. Two City Scheduling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1029)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost_i, bCost_i]`. The cost of sending the `i-th` person to city A is `aCost_i`, and the cost of sending the `i-th` person to city B is `bCost_i`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city. (It is guaranteed that there are `2n` people).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What is the size limit of the input array `costs`?
    - *It's typically as per competitive programming constraints but good to know specifics.*
2. **Integer Range:** What are the potential ranges of the cost values?
    - *Helps to know if we need to handle very large numbers.*
3. **Edge Cases:** Are there any specific edge cases we need to consider?
    - *Helps in validating our logic.*

## Strategy

1. **Sort by Cost Difference:**
    - Calculate the difference `diff_i = aCost_i - bCost_i` for each person. 
    - This difference tells us the relative cost-effectiveness of sending each person to city A compared to city B.
    - Sort the array of costs based on these differences. This way, you can prioritize where participants should go based on the minimal extra cost incurred.

2. **Assign Half to Each City:**
    - Send the first `n` people in the sorted list to city A and the remaining `n` people to city B.

3. **Compute the Minimum Cost:**
    - Sum the costs accordingly to get the minimum total cost.

### Code

```javascript
function twoCitySchedCost(costs) {
    // Sort the costs by the difference between costA and costB
    costs.sort((a, b) => (a[0] - a[1]) - (b[0] - b[1]));
    
    let totalCost = 0;
    const n = costs.length / 2;
    
    // Send the first n people to city A and the rest to city B
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalCost += costs[i][0]; // sending to city A
        totalCost += costs[i + n][1]; // sending to city B
    }
    
    return totalCost;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The dominant part of the algorithm is sorting the array, which takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is half the length of the input array (since we have `2n` entries).
- **Summation:** Calculating the total cost in the loop takes `O(n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)`.

### Edge Cases

- The guaranteed constraint that there are `2n` people ensures that no special handling for an odd number of participants is necessary.
- Costs being zero or high values don't affect the logic as we are handling additions and comparisons, which are robust for integer operations within typical ranges.

By following this solution structure, the requirement to minimize the total cost while still sending equal participants to both cities should be efficiently met.
