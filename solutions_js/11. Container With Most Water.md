[Leetcode 11. Container With Most Water](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l11)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `height` where each integer represents the height of a vertical line on a graph. The array has `n` elements, and together with the x-axis, the vertical lines form a container. You want to find the container that can hold the most water.

The goal is to write a function that takes this array of heights and returns the maximum amount of water that the container can store.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the width of the container represent?**
   - The width of the container is the distance between indices of the two heights that form the container.
   
2. **Is the width strictly the difference between indices, or does it have more meaning?**
   - Yes, the width corresponds to the difference between indices.

3. **Are there any constraints on the input size or values?**
   - The array `height` will have at least two elements and each element will be a positive integer.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let maxArea = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        // Calculate the area
        let width = right - left;
        let currentHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        let currentArea = width * currentHeight;

        // Update maxArea if currentArea is larger
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);

        // Move the pointers to try and find a larger area
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Start with one pointer at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
2. **Calculate Area**: The area formed by the container is determined by the width (difference between the indices of the two pointers) and the height (minimum of the values at the two pointers).
3. **Move Pointers**:
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other pointer to possibly find a taller line, which might result in a larger area.
   - Repeat this process until the two pointers meet.
   
### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `height` array. The two-pointer technique ensures that we only traverse the array once.
2. **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

This method ensures an efficient solution to finding the container with the most water within linear time, leveraging the two-pointer approach to minimize unnecessary recalculations.
