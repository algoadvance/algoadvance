[Leetcode 670. Maximum Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l670)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **non-negative integer** `num` represented as a string. You are allowed to swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you can get.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = "2736"
Output: "7236"
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = "9973"
Output: "9973"
Explanation: No swap needed.
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= num.length <= 10^4`
* `num` does not contain any leading zeros.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer represented as a string?**
   - Yes.

2. **What should we return if multiple swaps result in the same maximum number?**
   - You can return any of them since they have the same value.

3. **Is there a constraint on time complexity we should aim for?**
   - Ideally, we should aim to solve it in linear time, O(n), due to the potential length of the input.

### Strategy
1. Traverse the string to record the last position of each digit (0-9).
2. Traverse the string again and for each digit, check if there is a larger digit later in the string.
3. If such a larger digit is found, swap the current digit with this larger digit and return the resultant string.
4. If no larger digit is found after any digit, the original string is already the largest possible value and can be returned as is.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumSwap(num) {
    let numArr = num.split('');
    let last = new Array(10).fill(-1);
    
    // Record the last position of each digit
    for (let i = 0; i < numArr.length; i++) {
        last[numArr[i]] = i;
    }
    
    // Try to find the first digit that can be larger by swapping
    for (let i = 0; i < numArr.length; i++) {
        for (let d = 9; d > numArr[i]; d--) {
            if (last[d] > i) {
                // swap
                [numArr[i], numArr[last[d]]] = [numArr[last[d]], numArr[i]];
                return numArr.join('');
            }
        }
    }
    
    return num;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. This comes from the two traversals over the string, which are linear operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space, if we consider the digit positions storage as a constant space of size 10. The array `numArr` just rearranges input and does not count as extra space beyond the input constraints.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum possible value by swapping the digits in a single pass, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.
