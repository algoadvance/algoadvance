[Leetcode 1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1697)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected weighted graph with `n` nodes (0-indexed from 0 to n-1), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`. You are also given a list of `queries` where `queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj]`. 

The answer to the `j-th` query is `true` if there is a path from `pj` to `qj` such that all the edges in the path have weights strictly less than `limitj`.

Return a boolean array `result`, where `result[j]` is the answer to the `j-th` query.

### Example

```javascript
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8]], queries = [[0,2,5],[0,2,1]]
Output: [true,false]
```

**Constraints:**
1. `2 <= n <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= edges.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
3. `edges[i].length == 3`
4. `queries[j].length == 3`
5. `0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n-1`
6. `1 <= weighti, limitj <= 10^9`
7. There are no repeated edges.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the graph have self-loops? No, as per the constraints.
2. Are all weights positive integers? Yes, as per the constraints.
3. Can `pj` and `qj` be the same in `queries`? Yes, in which case the result is determined by the limit alone.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** We'll use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to keep track of connected components with a specific edge weight threshold.
2. **Sort edges and queries:** 
   - First, sort the edges by their weights.
   - Sort the queries by their limit `limitj`.
3. **Process Queries:**
   - Iterate through the sorted queries and edges in a coordinated fashion.
   - Use the Union-Find data structure to connect nodes whenever we encounter an edge that fits in the current limit of the query.
   - Check if the nodes in the query are connected in the Union-Find structure.

This approach ensures that we efficiently use the Union-Find operations (with path compression and union by rank) to check the connectivity status of nodes.

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = new Array(size).fill(0).map((_, index) => index);
        this.rank = new Array(size).fill(1);
    }
    
    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]); // path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }
    
    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);
        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
}

var distanceLimitedPathsExist = function(n, edges, queries) {
    const uf = new UnionFind(n);
    const indexedQueries = queries.map((q, idx) => [...q, idx]);
    
    edges.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2]);
    indexedQueries.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2]);
    
    let result = new Array(queries.length).fill(false);
    let edgeIndex = 0;
    
    for (const [p, q, limit, originalIdx] of indexedQueries) {
        while (edgeIndex < edges.length && edges[edgeIndex][2] < limit) {
            const [u, v, weight] = edges[edgeIndex];
            uf.union(u, v);
            edgeIndex++;
        }
        if (uf.find(p) === uf.find(q)) {
            result[originalIdx] = true;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Edges:** `O(E log E)` where `E` is the number of edges.
2. **Sorting Queries:** `O(Q log Q)` where `Q` is the number of queries.
3. **Union-Find Operations:** In total, `O(E + Q * α(N))` where `α(N)` is the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant.
4. **Overall:** `O(E log E + Q log Q + E + Q)` simplifying to approximately `O((E+Q) log(E+Q))`.

This approach ensures efficient processing of large graphs and many queries.
