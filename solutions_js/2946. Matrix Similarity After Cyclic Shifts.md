[Leetcode 2946. Matrix Similarity After Cyclic Shifts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2946)
### Problem Statement

You are given two `m x n` binary matrices, `grid1` and `grid2`. You want to determine if you can cyclically shift each row of `grid2` any number of times such that `grid1` becomes equal to `grid2`.

A cyclic shift for a row means moving its last element to the front (right shift) or moving its first element to the back (left shift).

Return `true` if it's possible to equalize `grid1` and `grid2`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: grid1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0]], grid2 = [[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can shift the first row of grid2 to the right one time to match the first row of grid1.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions (m and n)?**
   - `1 <= m, n <= 300`.
   
2. **What are the possible values of the elements in the matrices?**
   - The elements are binary values, i.e., either `0` or `1`.

3. **Can we assume the matrices are always the same dimension?**
   - Yes, both matrices will always be `m x n`.

4. **Is a cyclic shift considered only within individual rows or across columns as well?**
   - Only within individual rows.

### Strategy

1. **Cyclic Shifts for Comparison**:
   - To verify if a row in `grid2` can be shifted to match a row in `grid1`, we will generate all cyclic permutations of each row in `grid2`.
   - A quick way to do this is to duplicate the row and consider all sub-arrays of length `n` from the duplicated row.

2. **Comparison**:
   - For each row in `grid1`, check all possible cyclic shifts of the corresponding row in `grid2` to see if any match.

### Code

```javascript
var canBeEqual = function(grid1, grid2) {
    let m = grid1.length;
    let n = grid1[0].length;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        let row1 = grid1[i];
        let row2 = grid2[i];
        
        // Create a row that represents two back-to-back row2 for easy cyclic shift checks
        let doubledRow = row2.concat(row2);
        
        let isEqual = false;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            let cyclicShiftRow = doubledRow.slice(j, j + n);
            if (arraysEqual(row1, cyclicShiftRow)) {
                isEqual = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (!isEqual) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};

function arraysEqual(arr1, arr2) {
    if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Generating doubledRow and checking subarrays involves O(m * n^2) operations in total.
- We have to check all possible cyclic shifts for each row, which involves comparing up to `n` subarrays of length `n`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n^2)**. This is efficient given the constraints.
