[Leetcode 2283. Check if Number Has Equal Digit Count and Digit Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2283)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `num` representing a number, you need to determine if this number has an equal digit count and digit value.

For a given string `num`, the digit value of a digit at index `i` is the count of digit `i` in the string. You have to return `true` if the digit values of all digits from 0 to the length of `num` minus 1 in `num` are equal to the corresponding digits in `num`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example:
```
Input: num = "1210"
Output: true

Explanation:
num[0] = 1, and there is one 0 in num.
num[1] = 2, and there are two 1s in num.
num[2] = 1, and there is one 2 in num.
num[3] = 0, and there are no 3s in num.
Since the digit values match the number count, return true.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can `num` contain non-numeric characters?**
   - No, `num` is guaranteed to be a numeric string.
2. **What is the maximum length of `num`?**
   - This isn't specified, but typically, constraints would ensure `num` is of a manageable length for typical solutions.
   
### Strategy:
1. Parse through `num` string and use an array `count` to keep track of the number of times each digit appears.
2. Iterate through the string `num` and populate the `count` array where `count[d]` is the number of occurrences of digit `d`.
3. Iterate again through each character in the string `num` and check if the current digit matches the count of its index digit.
4. If all digits match their counts, return true; otherwise, return false.

### Code:
```javascript
function digitCount(num) {
    const count = new Array(10).fill(0);

    // Fill the count array with the frequency of each digit
    for(let i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {
        const digit = Number(num[i]);
        count[digit]++;
    }
    
    // Verify each digit with the count
    for(let i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {
        if(Number(num[i]) !== count[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `num`. This is because we iterate through the string a couple of times: once to fill in the count array and once to verify the counts. The space complexity is **O(1)** as the size of the count array is constant and does not depend on the input size.

### Summary:
The problem was to check if the frequency of digits in the string `num` corresponds to their positional values. The proposed solution effectively loops through the string twice with a constant-time array look-up, ensuring an efficient O(n) time complexity.
