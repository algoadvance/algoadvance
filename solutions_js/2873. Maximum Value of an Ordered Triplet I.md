[Leetcode 2873. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2873)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Determine the maximum value of any ordered triplet (i, j, k) in the array such that `0 <= i < j < k < nums.length`. The value of the triplet is defined as `nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be non-negative?
   **Answer:** Not necessarily; the elements can be both negative and positive.

2. **Question:** What are the constraints on the array size?
   **Answer:** The problem typically allows for constraints where \( n \) (length of the array) could be large, up to \( 10^5 \).

3. **Question:** Should we consider the case where the array has fewer than three elements?
   **Answer:** No, the problem guarantees an array length where there are at least three elements.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting Approach:** One straightforward approach is to sort the array and consider the maximum product from the first two and last one or the first one and the last two, due to the possibility of negative numbers.
  
   - The highest product of three numbers might involve the three largest numbers in the array.
   - Alternatively, it might involve the two smallest (most negative) numbers and the largest number.

2. **Steps:**
   1. Sort the array.
   2. Compute the product of the three largest numbers.
   3. Compute the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number.
   4. Return the maximum of these two products.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumTripletValue(nums) {
    // Sort the array in ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Compute the products:
    const option1 = nums[n - 1] * nums[n - 2] * nums[n - 3];  // Three largest numbers
    const option2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[n - 1];          // Two smallest and the largest number
    
    // Return the maximum of the two options
    return Math.max(option1, option2);
}

// Example Usage
const nums = [-10, -10, 5, 2];
console.log("Maximum Triplet Value:", maximumTripletValue(nums)); // Output: 500
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Time Complexity:** \( O(n \log n) \) for sorting the array.
- **Constant Time Operations:** After sorting, the multiplications and comparisons are done in constant time \( O(1) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \( O(n \log n) \).

This approach ensures that we consider all possibilities for maximizing the product of an ordered triplet while efficiently leveraging sorting.
