[Leetcode 204. Count Primes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l204)
Certainly! Let's break down the process step by step.

## Problem Statement

You need to count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative integer n.

## Clarifying Questions

To ensure we understand the problem correctly, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. **What is the expected input range for n?** 
   - This would help optimize the solution accordingly.
2. **Is n guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?**
   - Non-negative ensures we're counting primes for \( n \geq 0 \).

Letâ€™s assume \( n \) is always a non-negative integer for now.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the most efficient way is to use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** algorithm, which is a classical algorithm to find all primes less than a number \( n \).

### Sieve of Eratosthenes Steps:
1. Create a boolean array `isPrime` of size n, initially filled with `true`.
2. Mark `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` as `false` because 0 and 1 are not primes.
3. Iterate from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \), and for each number, if it is still marked as `true`, mark all its multiples as `false`.
4. Finally, count the number of `true` values in the `isPrime` array.

### Code

Here is the code that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countPrimes = function(n) {
    if (n <= 2) return 0;
    
    // Step 1: Initialize isPrime array
    const isPrime = new Array(n).fill(true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;  // 0 and 1 are not primes
    
    // Step 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes
    for (let i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (let j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Count primes
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is:

- **O(n log log n)**: This is much more efficient than O(n^2) which would result from checking every number for all divisors less than its square root.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: We use an array of size \( n \) to store boolean values indicating whether each number is prime.

This approach balances both time and space efficiency, making it suitable for large values of \( n \).
