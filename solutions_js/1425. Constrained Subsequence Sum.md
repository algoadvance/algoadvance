[Leetcode 1425. Constrained Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1425)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, their indices in `nums` are at most `k` apart.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in the `nums` array?**
   - The values can be both negative and positive integers.

2. **Can `k` be greater than the length of `nums`?**
   - No, based on the problem constraints, you can assume that `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

3. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - Typically, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

4. **Are we considering subsequences in the order they appear in `nums`?**
   - Yes, the subsequence should maintain the given order of `nums`.

With these questions in mind, we can proceed to the strategy and implementation.

### Strategy

To approach this problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming with Deque**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - Use a deque to keep track of indices of `nums` that help in evaluating the maximum value in the sliding window of size `k`.

Steps:
1. Initialize `dp[i]` as `nums[i]` initially because the subsequence that ends at `i` at the very least includes `nums[i]`.
2. Process from left to right. For each element `i`, determine `dp[i]` based on the values up to `i-1` and within the distance `k`.
3. Maintain a deque to keep track of the maximum value in the sliding window of size `k`.
4. For each element `i`, update the deque to include indices appropriately and remove indices that are out of the current window.
5. The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Code

```javascript
var constrainedSubsetSum = function(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = Array(n).fill(0);
    const deque = [];

    dp[0] = nums[0];
    deque.push(0);
    let maxSum = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Remove indices that are out of the window
        if (deque[0] < i - k) {
            deque.shift();
        }
        
        // Calculate dp[i]
        dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp[deque[0]]);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, dp[i]);
        
        // Maintain the deque
        while (deque.length > 0 && dp[i] >= dp[deque[deque.length - 1]]) {
            deque.pop();
        }
        deque.push(i);
    }

    return maxSum;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Each element is pushed and popped from the deque at most once, so all operations inside the loop run in linear time relative to the size of `nums`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The `dp` array takes linear space, and in the worst case, the deque can hold all elements.

This solution is efficient and should handle the constraints specified in typical competitive programming environments.
