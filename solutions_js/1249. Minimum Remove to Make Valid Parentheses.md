[Leetcode 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1249)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of `(`, `)`, and lowercase English characters, your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (either `(` or `)`, or both) such that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

A string is considered valid if:
1. It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
2. It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
```
```
Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
```
```
Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
2. Can the input string contain spaces or other characters apart from lowercase English letters and parentheses? (Assuming it only contains the specified characters for this problem)
3. Should the output maintain the order of characters as in the input string?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to track the indices of unmatched parentheses. Here are the main steps:

1. **First Pass (from Left to Right):**
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Use a stack to record indices of unmatched `(` parentheses.
   - Skip or mark `)` for removal when there is no matching `(` in the stack.

2. **Second Pass (from Right to Left):**
   - Traverse the string from right to left, this time removing any unmatched `(` that were recorded in the stack during the first pass.

3. **Construct the Result:**
   - Build the result string by including only the characters that are not marked for removal.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function minRemoveToMakeValid(s) {
    let stack = [];
    let chars = s.split('');

    // First pass: mark unmatched ')' for removal and record indices of unmatched '('
    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        if (chars[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else if (chars[i] === ')') {
            if (stack.length === 0) {
                chars[i] = ''; // Mark for removal
            } else {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    // Second pass: mark the unmatched '(' for removal
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        let index = stack.pop();
        chars[index] = ''; // Mark for removal
    }

    // Construct the result string
    return chars.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minRemoveToMakeValid("lee(t(c)o)de)")); // Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
console.log(minRemoveToMakeValid("a)b(c)d"));        // Output: "ab(c)d"
console.log(minRemoveToMakeValid("))(("));           // Output: ""
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The two passes through the string for marking and the use of the stack operations are all linear with respect to the number of characters in the string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the auxiliary space used for the stack and the character array.
