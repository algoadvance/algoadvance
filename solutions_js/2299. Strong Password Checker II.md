[Leetcode 2299. Strong Password Checker II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2299)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `password`, you need to determine if it is a "strong" password. Passwords are considered strong if they satisfy all the following criteria:
1. It has at least 8 characters.
2. It contains at least one lowercase letter.
3. It contains at least one uppercase letter.
4. It contains at least one digit.
5. It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: "!@#$%^&*()-+".
6. It does not contain two of the same characters in adjacent positions (i.e., "aa", "11", "!!", etc. are invalid).

Return `true` if the password is strong and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the password contain any whitespace characters?
   - No, typical password rules exclude whitespace from being part of the password.
2. Should we assume that the input will always be a string?
   - Yes, for the purpose of this problem, we can assume the input will always be a string.

### Strategy
We will iteratively check each of the conditions to determine if the password is strong:
1. Check if the password length is at least 8 characters.
2. Use boolean flags to ensure the password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
3. Traverse the password to ensure no two adjacent characters are the same.
   
We will return `true` if all conditions are met, otherwise `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function strongPasswordCheckerII(password) {
    if (password.length < 8) return false;
    
    const specialChars = "!@#$%^&*()-+";
    
    let hasLower = false;
    let hasUpper = false;
    let hasDigit = false;
    let hasSpecial = false;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < password.length; i++) {
        const char = password[i];
        
        if (i > 0 && char === password[i - 1]) return false;
        
        if (!hasLower && char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') {
            hasLower = true;
        } else if (!hasUpper && char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z') {
            hasUpper = true;
        } else if (!hasDigit && char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
            hasDigit = true;
        } else if (!hasSpecial && specialChars.includes(char)) {
            hasSpecial = true;
        }
    }
    
    return hasLower && hasUpper && hasDigit && hasSpecial;
}

// Sample Test
console.log(strongPasswordCheckerII("IloveLe3tcode!")); // Expected: true
console.log(strongPasswordCheckerII("123456")); // Expected: false
console.log(strongPasswordCheckerII("Ab3!Ab3!")); // Expected: false (repetition of 'A', 'b', '3', '!')
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where \( n \) is the length of the input password. This is because we are iterating through the password string once to check all the conditions.
