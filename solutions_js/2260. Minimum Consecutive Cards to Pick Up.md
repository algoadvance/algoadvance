[Leetcode 2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2260)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the type of the i-th card. A card type should be picked up consecutively. We need to find the minimum length of a subarray such that it contains at least one pair of equal cards. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no pairs of cards exist?**
   - Return -1.

2. **What is the range of values for the length of `cards` array?**
   - Let's assume the length can be reasonably large, e.g., up to `10^5`.

3. **Can the values of the cards be negative or non-integer values?**
   - Assume card values are integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window and Hash Map Approach:**
   - Use a hashmap to store the last seen index of each card type.
   - As we iterate through the array, check if the current card has been seen before by looking it up in the hashmap.
   - If it has been seen before, calculate the distance between the current and the last seen index and update the minimum subarray length if the current distance is smaller.
   - Update the hashmap with the current index of the card.
   - Return the minimum length found, or -1 if no such pair exists.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cards
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumCardPickup = function(cards) {
    let lastSeen = new Map();
    let minLength = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < cards.length; i++) {
        if (lastSeen.has(cards[i])) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - lastSeen.get(cards[i]) + 1);
        }
        lastSeen.set(cards[i], i);
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? -1 : minLength;
};

// Example usage
console.log(minimumCardPickup([3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 7])); // Output: 4
console.log(minimumCardPickup([1, 0, 5, 3])); // Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the `cards` array as we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) where `m` is the number of unique card types in the array which essentially is the space used by the hashmap. In the worst case, where all cards are unique, this is O(n).

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum length of subarrays containing pairs of equal cards without unnecessary reprocessing of elements.
