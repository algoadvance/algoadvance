[Leetcode 218. The Skyline Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l218)
### Problem Statement
The Skyline Problem: 

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

Each building is represented by a triplet `[Li, Ri, Hi]`, where:
- `Li` is the x coordinate of the left edge.
- `Ri` is the x coordinate of the right edge.
- `Hi` is the height.

The output should be a list of "key points" in the format `[x, y]` that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the height becomes 0 after the last building, is also part of the skyline.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input and Output Format**:
   - Is the input always valid (i.e., no overlapping buildings in input)?
   - Are the coordinates integers, and are they positive?
   - Should the output list of key points be sorted by x coordinates?

2. **Scenario Handling**:
   - How should we handle buildings that completely overlap each other?
   - How should we handle buildings contained within other buildings?

3. **Constraints:**
   - Is there a constraint on the number of buildings? If yes, what is the maximum number of buildings?

### Strategy
1. **Event Points**:
   - Treat each building as two events: the start of the building and the end of the building.
   - Thus, for each building, generate two events. Sort these events primarily by x coordinate. If the x coordinates are the same, then event type (start or end) should decide the sorting order.

2. **Heap Data Structure**:
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the heights of the buildings as we process the events.
   - When processing a start event, add the height to the heap.
   - When processing an end event, remove the height from the heap.

3. **Result Updates**:
   - Track the current highest building using the max-heap.
   - Whenever the highest building changes (either by adding a new building or removing one), it signifies a critical point of the skyline, hence add it to the result list.

### Code
Here's a JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} buildings
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
function getSkyline(buildings) {
    const events = [];
    
    // Create building start (+height) and end (-height) events
    for (let [L, R, H] of buildings) {
        events.push([L, -H, R]); // start of a building
        events.push([R, H, 0]);  // end of a building
    }
    
    // Sort events
    events.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] !== b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
        if (a[1] !== b[1]) return a[1] - b[1];
        return a[2] - b[2];
    });

    const result = [];
    const maxHeap = new MaxHeap();
    maxHeap.add(0);
    let prevMaxHeight = 0;

    for (let [x, height, edge] of events) {
        if (height < 0) { // Building start
            maxHeap.add(-height);
        } else { // Building end
            maxHeap.remove(height);
        }
        
        let currentMaxHeight = maxHeap.peek();
        if (currentMaxHeight !== prevMaxHeight) {
            result.push([x, currentMaxHeight]);
            prevMaxHeight = currentMaxHeight;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    add(value) {
        this.heap.push(value);
        this._bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }
    
    remove(value) {
        let index = this.heap.indexOf(value);
        if (index === -1) return;
        
        this._swap(index, this.heap.length - 1);
        this.heap.pop();
        this._bubbleDown(index);
    }
    
    peek() {
        return this.heap.length ? this.heap[0] : null;
    }
    
    _bubbleUp(index) {
        if (index <= 0) return;
        
        let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
        if (this.heap[parentIndex] < this.heap[index]) {
            this._swap(parentIndex, index);
            this._bubbleUp(parentIndex);
        }
    }
    
    _bubbleDown(index) {
        let leftChild = index * 2 + 1;
        let rightChild = index * 2 + 2;
        let largest = index;
        
        if (leftChild < this.heap.length && this.heap[leftChild] > this.heap[largest]) {
            largest = leftChild;
        }
        if (rightChild < this.heap.length && this.heap[rightChild] > this.heap[largest]) {
            largest = rightChild;
        }
        
        if (largest !== index) {
            this._swap(index, largest);
            this._bubbleDown(largest);
        }
    }
    
    _swap(i, j) {
        let temp = this.heap[i];
        this.heap[i] = this.heap[j];
        this.heap[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting events**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of buildings.
- **Heap operations (adding/removing)**: Each operation takes \(O(\log n)\).
- **Overall Complexity**: The events processing involves inserting and removing each building height in the heap, leading to \(O(n \log n)\) operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).
