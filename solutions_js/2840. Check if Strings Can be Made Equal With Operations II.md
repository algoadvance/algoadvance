[Leetcode 2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2840)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of the same length. You can perform the following operation on `s1` any number of times:

- Choose any character from `s1` and swap it with any other character from `s1`.

Return `true` if you can make `s1` equal to `s2`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Set**: Are the strings `s1` and `s2` limited to lowercase alphabets only, or can they contain uppercase letters and special characters?
2. **Length Constraint**: Are there any constraints on the lengths of `s1` and `s2` other than them being equal?

For simplicity, let's assume the strings contain only lowercase alphabets, as this is usually the typical scenario in such problems.

### Strategy

Since any character from `s1` can be swapped any number of times, two strings can be considered equal if they have the same set of characters with the same frequencies. This is essentially checking if `s1` is a permutation of `s2`.

Steps:
1. If the lengths of `s1` and `s2` are different, return `false`.
2. Generate frequency counts for each character in both `s1` and `s2`.
3. Compare the frequency maps; if they are identical, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function canBeMadeEqual(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
    
    const frequencyMap1 = {};
    const frequencyMap2 = {};

    for (let char of s1) {
        frequencyMap1[char] = (frequencyMap1[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    for (let char of s2) {
        frequencyMap2[char] = (frequencyMap2[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    for (let key in frequencyMap1) {
        if (frequencyMap1[key] !== frequencyMap2[key]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Frequency Maps**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Comparing Frequency Maps**: O(1) because there are a fixed number of characters (26 lowercase alphabets).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity

- **Frequency Maps Storage**: O(1) because the storage required depends on the number of unique characters, which is constant (26 lowercase characters).

Thus, the overall space complexity is O(1).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if two strings can be made equal by checking their character frequencies.
