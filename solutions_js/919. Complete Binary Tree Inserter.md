[Leetcode 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l919)
## Problem Statement
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. Design an algorithm to insert a new node into a complete binary tree while maintaining its completeness. Implement the `CBTInserter` class with the following methods:

1. `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` - Initializes the data structure with the root of a complete binary tree.
2. `int insert(int v)` - Inserts a node into the complete binary tree with value `v` and returns the value of the parent of the inserted node.
3. `TreeNode get_root()` - Returns the root node of the tree.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input:
["CBTInserter", "insert", "insert", "get_root"]
[[1], [2], [3], []]
Output:
[null, 1, 2, [1, 2, 3]]
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5000`
- `root` is a complete binary tree.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we assume the tree input to the constructor is always a valid complete binary tree?
   - Yes, the problem statement guarantees it.
2. How should we handle invalid inputs for value `v` or operations?
   - Since the constraints are defined, we assume valid inputs as specified.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Use a queue to facilitate level-order traversal, storing nodes in a way that allows us to quickly find where to insert new nodes.

2. **Insertion**: To maintain completeness:
   - Scan the queue for a node with an available child spot (left or right).
   - Insert the new node.
   - Push the new node into the queue.

3. **Getting the Root**: Simply return the stored root node.

Here's how the operations correspond to each method:

### `CBTInserter`:
- Takes the root and constructs a queue consisting initially of all nodes in the tree up to the last level in level-order.

### `insert`:
- Identifies the first node in the queue with an empty child position (left or right).
- Inserts the new node there and updates the queue.

### `get_root`:
- Simply returns the root node.

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes, as we traverse the tree once.
- **Insertion**: `O(1)` average time, as inserting a node just involves checking one node and updating pointers.
- **Retrieving the root**: `O(1)` since it is a direct retrieval.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = this.right = null;
  }
}

class CBTInserter {
  constructor(root) {
    this.root = root;
    this.deque = [];
    
    // Level-order traversal to populate deque
    const queue = [root];
    while (queue.length) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
      if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
      this.deque.push(node);
    }
  }

  insert(v) {
    const newNode = new TreeNode(v);
    while (true) {
      const node = this.deque[0];
      if (!node.left) {
        node.left = newNode;
        break;
      } else if (!node.right) {
        node.right = newNode;
        break;
      } else {
        this.deque.shift();
      }
    }
    this.deque.push(newNode);
    return node.val;
  }

  get_root() {
    return this.root;
  }
}

// Example Usage
const root = new TreeNode(1);
const cbtInserter = new CBTInserter(root);
console.log(cbtInserter.insert(2)); // Output: 1
console.log(cbtInserter.insert(3)); // Output: 1
console.log(cbtInserter.get_root()); // Output: TreeNode { val: 1, left: TreeNode { val: 2, left: null, right: null }, right: TreeNode { val: 3, left: null, right: null } }
```

The provided solution ensures that the complete binary tree properties are maintained with every insertion and performs efficiently regarding the given constraints.
