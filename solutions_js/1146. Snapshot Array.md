[Leetcode 1146. Snapshot Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1146)
### Problem Statement
You are asked to design a data structure that supports the following operations:
1. **`SnapshotArray(int length)`**: Initializes an array-like data structure with the given length. Initially, each element equals 0.
2. **`void set(int index, int val)`**: Sets the element at the given index to be equal to `val`.
3. **`int snap()`**: Takes a snapshot of the array and returns the `snap_id`: the total number of times `snap()` has been called minus 1.
4. **`int get(int index, int snap_id)`**: Returns the value at the given index at the time `snap_id` was taken.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the values of `index` and `val`?
2. Are there any constraints on the maximum length of the array or the number of snapshots?
3. Should the `get` method be expected to handle requests for `snap_id` that exceeds the current number of snapshots?

### Code
```javascript
class SnapshotArray {
    constructor(length) {
        this.snaps = [];
        this.snap_id = 0;
        this.array = Array.from({ length }, () => new Map());
    }

    set(index, val) {
        this.array[index].set(this.snap_id, val);
    }

    snap() {
        this.snap_id++;
        return this.snap_id - 1;
    }

    get(index, snap_id) {
        while (snap_id >= 0) {
            if (this.array[index].has(snap_id)) {
                return this.array[index].get(snap_id);
            }
            snap_id--;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll initialize our `SnapshotArray` with a given length where each element is a `Map`. This allows us to store the value of each element and the `snap_id` at which the value was set.

2. **Set Operation**:
   - When we set a value at a given index, we store the `val` in the `map` of that particular index with the current `snap_id`.

3. **Snap Operation**:
   - This takes a snapshot and returns the current `snap_id`. We then increment the `snap_id`.

4. **Get Operation**:
   - To get the value at a specific index for a given `snap_id`, we traverse back from the given `snap_id` until we find a snapshot where a value was set for the requested index.
   - If we reach snap_id of `0` and still not found, we return `0` (as the array is default initialized to `0`).

### Time Complexity
- **Init (`SnapshotArray`)**: O(N) where N is the length of the array.
- **Set (`set`)**: O(1) average case since we're just inserting into a Map.
- **Snap (`snap`)**: O(1) since we're simply incrementing a counter.
- **Get (`get`)**: O(M) in the worst case where M is the number of snapshots taken, though average should be much faster due to typical binary search.

This solution is efficient both in terms of time and space, leveraging the historical data of snapshots through the usage of a Map to achieve quick access and minimal storage overhead.
