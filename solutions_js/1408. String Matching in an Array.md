[Leetcode 1408. String Matching in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1408)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of string `words`, return all strings in `words` that are substrings of another word in any order. 

A `substring` is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Example:
**Input:**
```plaintext
words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["as","hero"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the input array `words` contain empty strings?
   **A**: For this problem, we will assume no empty strings are present in the array.
   
2. **Q**: Are the returned substring results required to be sorted?
   **A**: The problem does not specify that the output needs to be sorted.

3. **Q**: Can the input array `words` contain duplicate strings?
   **A**: Yes, it can, but the duplicates are not required to appear multiple times in the result.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var stringMatching = function(words) {
    let result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
            if (i !== j && words[j].includes(words[i])) {
                result.push(words[i]);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Strategy
The idea is to iterate through all possible pairs of words in the array, and check if one word is a substring of the other. If it is, then we add it to the results.

## Steps:
1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the matching substrings.
2. Use two nested loops to compare each word with every other word in the array:
   - The outer loop iterates through each word with index `i`.
   - The inner loop iterates through each word with index `j`, ensuring that `i` is not equal to `j` (to avoid comparing a word against itself).
3. Use the JavaScript `.includes()` method to check if `words[i]` is a substring of `words[j]`.
4. If true, push `words[i]` to `result` and break out of the inner loop to prevent duplicate entries.
5. Return the `result` array.

## Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop also runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of words in the list. Thus, the time complexity is O(n^2).
- The `.includes()` method on average runs in O(m) time, where `m` is the length of the string being searched.
- In the worst case, the complexity could be O(n^2 * m), where `m` is the average length of the strings.

This implementation provides a correct and simple solution for the problem within an acceptable time complexity for typical input sizes.
