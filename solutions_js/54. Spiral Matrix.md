[Leetcode 54. Spiral Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l54)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done if the matrix is empty?**
   - If the matrix is empty (i.e., has no rows or columns), we should return an empty list.

2. **Can the matrix contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the matrix can contain negative numbers, zeros, or positive numbers.

3. **Is the input matrix always rectangular (i.e., no jagged arrays)?**
   - Yes, the input matrix will always be a valid rectangular matrix.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**
   - Define variables for the boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
   - Initialize `top` to `0`, `bottom` to `m - 1` (last row index), `left` to `0`, and `right` to `n - 1` (last column index).
   - Create an empty array `result` to store the spiral order elements.

2. **Traversal**
   - Use a `while` loop with the condition `top <= bottom` and `left <= right` to ensure we stay within the matrix bounds.
   - Inside the loop, perform the following steps:
     1. Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary. Increment `top`.
     2. Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary. Decrement `right`.
     3. Check if `top <= bottom` again (since it may have changed). If true, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary. Decrement `bottom`.
     4. Check if `left <= right` again. If true, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary. Increment `left`.

3. **Return Result**
   - Once the loop exits, return the `result` array containing the elements in spiral order.

### Code

```javascript
function spiralOrder(matrix) {
    if (matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
        return [];
    }

    let result = [];
    let top = 0;
    let bottom = matrix.length - 1;
    let left = 0;
    let right = matrix[0].length - 1;

    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Traverse from left to right along the top boundary
        for (let j = left; j <= right; j++) {
            result.push(matrix[top][j]);
        }
        top++;

        // Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            result.push(matrix[i][right]);
        }
        right--;

        if (top <= bottom) {
            // Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary
            for (let j = right; j >= left; j--) {
                result.push(matrix[bottom][j]);
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        if (left <= right) {
            // Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary
            for (let i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                result.push(matrix[i][left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because every element in the matrix is visited exactly once. The space complexity is **O(1)** if we do not count the space required for the output array, otherwise it is **O(m * n)** for storing the result.
