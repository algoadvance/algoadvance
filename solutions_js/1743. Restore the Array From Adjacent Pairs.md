[Leetcode 1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1743)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `adjacentPairs` of size `n-1` where each `adjacentPairs[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that the two elements `u_i` and `v_i` are adjacent in the array.

It is guaranteed that the array contains no duplicates and that the elements of the array are unique.

Return the array `restored` which is the array from which adjacentPairs were generated.

### Example
```
Input: adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for the integers in `adjacentPairs`?
2. Can the restored array start with any of the two endpoints?
3. Is it guaranteed that the array can be restored uniquely?

## Solution Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Build a Graph**: Represent the `adjacentPairs` as a graph where each unique integer is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if they are adjacent in the original array.
2. **Identify Endpoints**: The endpoints of the array will have only one adjacent node (degree of 1).
3. **Construct the Array**: Use the endpoints to start constructing the array, using a BFS or DFS approach to ensure all elements are connected properly.
4. **Output the Array**: Return the constructed array.

## Code

Here is the implementation using BFS to restore the array:

```javascript
function restoreArray(adjacentPairs) {
    const graph = new Map();
    
    // Build the graph
    for (const [u, v] of adjacentPairs) {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, []);
        graph.get(u).push(v);
        graph.get(v).push(u);
    }
    
    // Identify endpoints
    let start;
    for (let [node, neighbors] of graph.entries()) {
        if (neighbors.length === 1) {
            start = node;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Use BFS/DFS to construct the array
    const restoredArray = [];
    const visited = new Set();
    
    function dfs(node) {
        visited.add(node);
        restoredArray.push(node);
        for (const neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                dfs(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    dfs(start);
    
    return restoredArray;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes (or elements) in the graph. We traverse each node and edge exactly once to build the graph and the array.

The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the graph, the restored array, and the visited set.
