[Leetcode 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2000)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`. Find the **first occurrence** of `ch` in `word` and reverse the segment of `word` that starts at the beginning and ends at the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, return `word`.

For example:
- If `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should return `"dcbaefd"`.
- If `word = "xyxzxe" and `ch` = "z"`, then you should return `"zxyxxe"`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should we handle both uppercase and lowercase letters?
   **A:** The problem doesnâ€™t specify case sensitivity, so we should assume all characters are in the same case (e.g., all lowercase) unless stated otherwise.
   
2. **Q:** What should we return if the input string is empty?
   **A:** If `word` is empty, the result should also be an empty string.
   
3. **Q:** Can `ch` be any character, including digits or special characters?
   **A:** The problem example only shows lowercase letters but does not restrict `ch` in any way, so we should handle any valid character.

## Strategy

1. Find the first occurrence of `ch` in the string `word`.
2. If `ch` is not found, return the original `word`.
3. If `ch` is found, split the string into two parts:
   - The segment from the start of the string up to and including `ch`.
   - The rest of the string after `ch`.
4. Reverse the first segment and concatenate it with the second part.
5. Return the resulting string.

## Code

```javascript
function reversePrefix(word, ch) {
    // Find the index of the first occurrence of ch
    const idx = word.indexOf(ch);
    
    // If ch is not found, return the original word
    if (idx === -1) {
        return word;
    }
    
    // Split the word into two parts and reverse the first part
    const prefix = word.slice(0, idx + 1).split('').reverse().join('');
    const suffix = word.slice(idx + 1);
    
    // Concatenate the reversed prefix with the suffix
    return prefix + suffix;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the index:** The `indexOf` method runs in O(n) where n is the length of the string `word`.
- **Slicing the string:** Two `slice` operations each take O(n) since they depend on the length of the string segment.
- **Reversing and concatenation:** These operations (splitting, reversing, and joining) also run in O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, with `n` being the length of the input string `word`.
