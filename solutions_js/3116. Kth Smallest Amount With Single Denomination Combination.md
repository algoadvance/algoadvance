[Leetcode 3116. Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3116)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `coins` which contains unique integers representing different denominations of coins and an integer `K`, you need to return the K-th smallest amount that can be obtained using any number (even zero) of these coins. Assume that the amounts are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the typical sizes of the `coins` array and the value of `K`?
2. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints like maximum value for elements in `coins` or `K`?
3. **Output**: What should be returned if there are fewer than `K` possible amounts?
4. **Edge Cases**: How to handle edge cases like very small or very large values of `K`?

Assuming some reasonable constraints (for simplicity):
- `1 <= coins.length <= 10^3`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= K <= 10^6`

### Strategy
1. **Heap (Min-Heap)**: Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) to efficiently get the next smallest combination amount.
2. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to keep track of amounts that are already processed to avoid duplicates.
3. **Iterative Generation**: Start with zero amount (since using zero coins results in zero amount), iteratively compute the next possible smallest amounts by adding each denomination to the current smallest amount and pushing the result into the heap if it hasn't been processed before.

### Code

```javascript
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    push(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.heap.length === 1) {
            return this.heap.pop();
        }
        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this.bubbleDown(0);
        return min;
    }

    bubbleUp(index) {
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIdx = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index] >= this.heap[parentIdx]) break;
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIdx]] = [this.heap[parentIdx], this.heap[index]];
            index = parentIdx;
        }
    }

    bubbleDown(index) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        while (true) {
            let leftIdx = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightIdx = 2 * index + 2;
            let smallest = index;
            if (leftIdx < length && this.heap[leftIdx] < this.heap[smallest]) smallest = leftIdx;
            if (rightIdx < length && this.heap[rightIdx] < this.heap[smallest]) smallest = rightIdx;
            if (smallest === index) break;
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[smallest]] = [this.heap[smallest], this.heap[index]];
            index = smallest;
        }
    }

    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    top() {
        return this.heap[0];
    }
}

var kthSmallestAmount = function(coins, K) {
    const minHeap = new MinHeap();
    const seen = new Set();
    
    // Push the initial amount 0
    minHeap.push(0);
    seen.add(0);

    let currentAmount = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
        currentAmount = minHeap.pop();
        
        for (const coin of coins) {
            const newAmount = currentAmount + coin;
            if (!seen.has(newAmount)) {
                seen.add(newAmount);
                minHeap.push(newAmount);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return currentAmount;
};

// Example usage:
// coins = [1,2,3], K = 5
// kthSmallestAmount([1,2,3], 5) should return 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and deletion operation in a heap takes \(O(\log N)\) time, where \(N\) is the number of elements in the heap. Here \(N\) could grow linearly with \(K\) (in the worst case).
- **Total Operations**: Since each coin costs a heap push for each value up to \(K\), we get roughly \(O(K \cdot \log K)\) time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(K)\) due to the storage of amounts in the heap and the set.

This is efficient given the constraints and makes sure that the unique kth smallest amount is found accurately.
