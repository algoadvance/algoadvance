[Leetcode 2831. Find the Longest Equal Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2831)
### Problem Statement

You're given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the size constraints on the array `nums`?
   - Are there negative numbers and zeros allowed in the array `nums`?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return the length of the longest subarray or the subarray itself?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should the function return if the array is empty?
   - How should the function handle the case when `k` is 0? 

Assuming:
- `nums` array size `n` will follow `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- Elements of `nums` can be negative, zero, or positive.
- We should return the length of the longest subarray.
- If `nums` is empty, the result should be 0.
- When `k` is 0, we're looking for subarrays of identical elements.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to maintain the subarray and ensure the difference between the max and min element within the window is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Detailed Plan:**
   - Initialize a sliding window with two pointers, `left` and `right`.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of elements within the window.
   - Maintain the max and min values within the window to determine if the condition is satisfied.

3. **Steps:**
   - Loop through the array using the `right` pointer.
   - Update the frequency dictionary for the current element.
   - Continuously check if the current window is valid:
     - Calculate max and min from the frequency dictionary.
     - If valid, update the result for the maximum window size.
     - If not valid, slide the `left` pointer to the right and update the frequency dictionary accordingly.
   - Return the maximum window size found.

### Code

```javascript
function findLongestEqualSubarray(nums, k) {
    let maxLength = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let freqMap = new Map();
    
    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        let num = nums[right];
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
        
        while (Math.max(...freqMap.keys()) - Math.min(...freqMap.keys()) > k) {
            let leftNum = nums[left];
            freqMap.set(leftNum, freqMap.get(leftNum) - 1);
            if (freqMap.get(leftNum) === 0) {
                freqMap.delete(leftNum);
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The above code iterates over the elements of the array using a sliding window approach:
  - **O(n)** for the iteration where `n` is the length of the array.
  - However, calculating `Math.max` and `Math.min` over the keys of `freqMap` is `O(n)` in the worst case since if all elements are unique within the sliding window, the map's size can be proportional to `n`.
  
Thus, in its current form, the solution might have a time complexity of **O(n^2)** in the worst case.

To improve this, we can maintain the max and min values explicitly in constant time:

### Optimized Strategy

- Maintain two additional variables to track the max and min in constant time when updating the sliding window.
- Utilize data structures like min-heap and max-heap if necessary to track the max and min efficiently.

Would you like to proceed with the optimization, or do you have any specific requirements or constraints to address?
