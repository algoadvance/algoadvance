[Leetcode 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1047)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1047: **Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String**

Given a string `s`, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
   - Can the string contain characters other than lowercase letters?

2. **Expected Output:**
   - Should the output always be a string, even if it's empty?

### Code

```javascript
function removeDuplicates(s) {
    let stack = [];
    for (let char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === char) {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    return stack.join('');
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Use a Stack:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - Use a stack to keep track of characters. The idea is to append characters to the stack unless the character is the same as the one on top of the stack.
   - If the character is the same, pop the character from the stack, effectively removing the duplicate.

2. **Rationale:**
   - Using a stack helps in efficiently managing the removal of adjacent duplicates. By leveraging the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) property of the stack, we can easily check the last inserted character and decide whether to remove it or not.

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - We are iterating through the string of length `n` exactly once. Each operation (push and pop) on the stack takes O(1) time.

2. **Space Complexity:** O(n)
   - In the worst case, all characters can be pushed onto the stack resulting in a space complexity of O(n).

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:**

- Input: `s = "abbaca"`
- Process:
  - `a` → stack: ['a']
  - `b` → stack: ['a', 'b']
  - `b` → match with stack top, pop: ['a']
  - `a` → match with stack top, pop: []
  - `c` → stack: ['c']
  - `a` → stack: ['c', 'a']
- Output: "ca"

**Example 2:**

- Input: `s = "azxxzy"`
- Process:
  - `a` → stack: ['a']
  - `z` → stack: ['a', 'z']
  - `x` → stack: ['a', 'z', 'x']
  - `x` → match with stack top, pop: ['a', 'z']
  - `z` → match with stack top, pop: ['a']
  - `y` → stack: ['a', 'y']
- Output: "ay"

This approach ensures that all adjacent duplicates are removed effectively and the final output string is returned efficiently.
