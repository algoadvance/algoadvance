[Leetcode 806. Number of Lines To Write String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l806)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array `widths` that represents the widths of each character from 'a' to 'z' respectively. Here, the widths array is of length 26 where `widths[0]` is the width of character 'a', `widths[1]` is the width of character 'b', and so on.

We want to write the string `s` in lines such that each line does not exceed a maximum width of 100 units. Specifically, we need to determine how many lines are required to write the string and how many units of the last line are still occupied.

The function signature is:
```javascript
function numberOfLines(widths, s) {
  // your code goes here
}
```

You should return an array where the first element is the number of lines needed and the second element is the width occupied by the last line.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is there any specific character set beyond ASCII lowercase letters we need to consider?
2. Can the string `s` be empty?
3. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?

Assume the constraints:
- The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- widths.length == 26
- 1 <= widths[i] <= 10

### Strategy
1. Initialize the variables to keep track of the number of lines and the current width of the line.
2. Loop through each character in the string `s`:
   - Find the width of the character using the `widths` array.
   - Add the width to the current line's width.
   - If the width exceeds 100, increment the line counter and reset the current width.
3. Return the total lines and the width of the last line.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, as we are iterating through each character of the string once.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfLines(widths, s) {
    // Initialize number of lines and current width
    let lines = 1;
    let currentWidth = 0;

    for (const char of s) {
        const charWidth = widths[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];

        // Check if adding this character exceeds the max width (100 units)
        if (currentWidth + charWidth > 100) {
            lines++;
            currentWidth = charWidth;
        } else {
            currentWidth += charWidth;
        }
    }

    return [lines, currentWidth];
}
```

### Example
```javascript
const widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,
    10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,
    10,10,10,10,10,10];
const s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
console.log(numberOfLines(widths, s)); // Output should be [3, 60]
```

This solution initializes the `lines` variable to 1 and iterates through each character, updating the `currentWidth` accordingly. When the current line width exceeds 100, it increments the `lines` counter and resets the `currentWidth`. Finally, it returns the number of lines and the width occupied by the last line.
