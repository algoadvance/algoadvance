[Leetcode 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2139)
## Problem Statement
You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you want to reach the integer `target` by performing certain operations. In one move, you can either:

1. Increment your current integer by `1` (add 1), or
2. Multiply your current integer by `2` (double it).

Given two integers `target` and `maxDoubles`, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach the `target` starting with 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `target` be less than or equal to `1`?
   - No, `target` will always be an integer greater than 1.
2. Is there a constraint on the possible value of `target`?
   - The constraint on `target` will be such that brute force solutions are not efficient. Typically `target` can go up to \(10^9\), implying we should consider efficient algorithms rather than simple counting.
3. Can `maxDoubles` be `0`?
   - Yes, in such cases, we can only increment by `1`.

## Strategy
### Approach
1. **Working Backwards**:
   - Instead of trying to build up from 1 to the target, we reverse the problem to break down from the target to 1.
   - This way, division by 2 (if the number is even) and subtraction by 1 are our only operations required.
   - If `maxDoubles` allows, we perform divisions until `maxDoubles` are exhausted, then continue with decrements.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
   - While moving from `target` to `1`:
     - If `target` is even and `maxDoubles` is not zero, divide `target` by 2 and decrement `maxDoubles`.
     - If `target` is odd, subtract 1 from `target`.
     - If `maxDoubles` are exhausted, simply subtract 1 until reaching `1`.

### Code Implementation
```javascript
function minMoves(target, maxDoubles) {
    let moves = 0;
    
    while (target > 1) {
        if (target % 2 === 0 && maxDoubles > 0) {
            target = Math.floor(target / 2);
            maxDoubles--;
        } else if (target % 2 === 1 && maxDoubles > 0) {
            // if it's odd, we subtract 1 to make it even
            target -= 1;
        } else {
            // if maxDoubles are exhausted, we can only increment or decrement
            moves += target - 1;
            break;
        }
        moves++;
    }
    
    return moves;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(target))\), since with each division, we reduce the target by a factor of 2.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a finite number of variables.

This solution ensures that we efficiently reach the target with the minimum number of moves by smartly utilizing division and subtraction operations.
