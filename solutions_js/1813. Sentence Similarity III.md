[Leetcode 1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1813)
### Problem Statement
You are given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`. The sentences consist of lowercase English letters and spaces only. You would like to check if one sentence can be made equal to the other by inserting an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside both sentences.

Specifically, you want to check if:
- sentence2 can be formed by inserting any sentence (possibly empty) inside `sentence1`, or
- sentence1 can be formed by inserting any sentence (possibly empty) inside `sentence2`.

Return `true` if it's possible and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence1 = "my name is Haley", sentence2 = "my Haley"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be formed by inserting "name is" inside sentence1.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence1 = "of", sentence2 = "A lot of words"
Output: false
Explanation: No other sentence can be inserted to form sentence1.
```

**Example 3:**
```plaintext
Input: sentence1 = "Eats apple", sentence2 = "apple"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be formed by inserting "Eats " inside sentence1.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the sentences be empty?
   - The sentences will not be empty as per problem statement constraints.
2. Are the spaces significant?
   - Yes, spaces separate words, and their positions matter for matching.

### Strategy
1. Split both sentences into arrays of words.
2. Compare the words from the start of both sentences and remove matching words from the start.
3. Compare the words from the end of the remaining arrays and remove matching words from the end.
4. After removing matching words from both ends, check if either of the sentences is empty or the middle part of one sentence is fully contained within the other.

### Code
Here's a JavaScript solution implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2) {
    const words1 = sentence1.split(' ');
    const words2 = sentence2.split(' ');

    let start = 0;
    while(start < words1.length && start < words2.length && words1[start] === words2[start]) {
        start++;
    }

    let end1 = words1.length - 1;
    let end2 = words2.length - 1;
    while(end1 >= start && end2 >= start && words1[end1] === words2[end2]) {
        end1--;
        end2--;
    }

    return start > end1 || start > end2;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(areSentencesSimilar("my name is Haley", "my Haley")); // true
console.log(areSentencesSimilar("of", "A lot of words")); // false
console.log(areSentencesSimilar("Eats apple", "apple")); // true
```

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the sentences into word arrays:** `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `sentence1` and `sentence2`.
- **Two-pointer comparison from both ends:** `O(min(n, m))`.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n + m)`.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarifications!
