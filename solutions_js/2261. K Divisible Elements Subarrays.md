[Leetcode 2261. K Divisible Elements Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2261)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`. Return the number of distinct subarrays which have at most `k` elements divisible by `p`.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of elements in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of `nums`?**
   - This helps in understanding the potential time complexity constraints.
   
2. **What is the range of values for `k` and `p`?**
   - This helps in understanding edge cases such as `k` or `p` being zero.

3. **Are negative numbers present in `nums`?**

Let's assume a few things for simplicity:
- Length of `nums`: Up to \(10^4\).
- Value of elements in `nums`: \([-10^4, 10^4]\).
- Values of `k` and `p`: \(1 \leq k, p \leq 100\).

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Subarrays:** We can generate all possible subarrays of `nums`.
2. **Filter based on Condition:** For each subarray, count the number of elements divisible by `p`. Check if this count is at most `k`.
3. **Store in a Set:** Use a set to store unique subarrays meeting the condition (using string representation to ensure uniqueness).
4. **Count Unique Subarrays:** Return the size of the set, which represents the number of unique subarrays.

### Implementation

```javascript
function countDistinct(nums, k, p) {
    let uniqueSubarrays = new Set();
    let n = nums.length;
  
    // Go through all possible subarrays
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let countDivisibleByP = 0;
        let subarray = [];
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            subarray.push(nums[j]);
            if (nums[j] % p === 0) {
                countDivisibleByP++;
            }
    
            if (countDivisibleByP > k) {
                break;
            }
            // Add a string representation of the subarray to the set
            uniqueSubarrays.add(subarray.toString());
        }
    }
      
    // The size of the set is the number of unique subarrays
    return uniqueSubarrays.size;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop:** Runs \(O(n)\) times where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Inner Loop:** Also runs \(O(n)\) times in the worst case.
- **Checking Each Subarray:** We spend \(O(1)\) time for adding to the set, and generating a string from the subarray might take \(O(m)\) time, where \(m\) is the average length of the subarray.

**Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n^3)\) in the worst case due to the nested loops and the potential cost of converting arrays to strings and adding them to a set.

This approach is straightforward but not the most efficient for large input sizes. Optimizations could involve more advanced data structures or algorithms to reduce the brute-force checking, but this should suffice for moderate-sized inputs given typical interview constraints.

### Test Cases

1. **Example Test Case:**

    ```javascript
    console.log(countDistinct([2, 3, 3, 2, 2], 2, 2));  // Output: 11
    ```

2. **Edge Case of Empty Array:**

    ```javascript
    console.log(countDistinct([], 1, 1));  // Output: 0
    ```

3. **Single Element:**

    ```javascript
    console.log(countDistinct([2], 1, 2));  // Output: 1
    console.log(countDistinct([2], 0, 2));  // Output: 0
    ```

4. **All Elements Non-Divisible:**

    ```javascript
    console.log(countDistinct([1, 3, 5], 2, 2));  // Output: 6
    ```

These cases should cover a variety of scenarios ensuring robustness of the solution.
