[Leetcode 1542. Find Longest Awesome Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1542)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`. An awesome substring is a non-empty substring of `s` such that it can be made a palindrome after removing at most one character. 

Return the length of the maximum length awesome substring of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What characters can `s` contain?**
   - `s` contains only numeric digits (i.e., '0' through '9').

2. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the string `s` is non-empty.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of `s`?**
   - The length of `s` is between `1` and `10^5`.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem efficiently, we will use the concept of bitmasking and prefix hashmap. Here is the strategy broken down step-by-step:

1. **Bitmask Representation**:
    - Use a 10-bit bitmask to represent the parity (odd/even count) of the digits '0' to '9'. Each bit in this mask represents the parity of a particular digit.
    - A bit is `0` if the frequency of the corresponding digit is even, and `1` if it is odd.

2. **Prefix Bitmask and Hashmap**:
    - Maintain a variable `prefixMask` to keep track of the cumulative parity of digits up to the current index in `s`.
    - Use a hashmap `prefixMap` to store the first occurrence of each `prefixMask`. This helps us quickly find the length of the substring that forms a palindrome with respect to the parities of digits.

3. **Checking for Palindrome Conditions**:
    - If `prefixMask` at two different indices is the same, the digits in between those indices have balanced out to even parity, forming a palindrome.
    - Additionally, each of the 10 bits can be individually toggled to check for the condition where one character can be removed to form a palindrome.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
    - Iterate through the string while updating `prefixMask` and checking the conditions mentioned above to find the maximum length of the awesome substring.

### Code:

```javascript
var longestAwesome = function(s) {
    let prefixMask = 0;
    const prefixMap = new Map();
    prefixMap.set(0, -1);
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const digit = s[i] - '0';
        // Toggle bit for the current digit
        prefixMask ^= (1 << digit);
        
        // Check if we have seen this prefixMask before
        if (prefixMap.has(prefixMask)) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - prefixMap.get(prefixMask));
        } else {
            prefixMap.set(prefixMask, i);
        }
        
        // Check all masks with one bit toggled to allow one odd count digit
        for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            const toggledMask = prefixMask ^ (1 << j);
            if (prefixMap.has(toggledMask)) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - prefixMap.get(toggledMask));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * 10)` = `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. The inner loop runs a constant number (10) of times for each character in the string.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(2^10)` = `O(1)`, since the prefix mask has a maximum of 1024 different states.

This solution efficiently finds the longest awesome substring by leveraging bitwise operations and a hashmap to keep track of prefix masks, ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.
