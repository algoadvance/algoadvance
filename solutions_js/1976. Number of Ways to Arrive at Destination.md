[Leetcode 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1976)
## Problem Statement

You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with `roads` where `roads[i] = [u, v, time]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between intersections `u` and `v` that takes `time` minutes to travel. You want to know in how many different ways you can arrive at the destination intersection `n - 1` starting from the intersection `0`. 

Return the number of ways you can arrive at the destination `n - 1` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

You are provided with:

- `n` (an integer representing the number of intersections)
- `roads` (an array of arrays with each sub-array indicating a bidirectional road and the time cost).

Clarify the input constraints and assumptions:

- All given intersections (nodes) are reachable from any other intersection.
- There are no negative weights or cycles.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes.
3. **Counting Paths**: As we run Dijkstra's Algorithm, keep track of the number of ways to reach each node using the shortest path. We use dynamic programming for this purpose.

We'll use a priority queue to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm effectively.

**Steps**:

1. Initialize a `dist` array to store the shortest distance to reach each node. Initialize with `Infinity` except for the starting node (0).
2. Initialize a `ways` array to store the number of ways to reach each node using the shortest path. Initialize with `0` except for the starting node (1).
3. Use a priority queue to explore the nodes based on their current shortest distance.
4. For each node, update distances and count paths for neighbors when a shorter path is found or when another path with the same shortest distance is found.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can two roads have the same end intersections but different travel times?
2. Are there any constraints on the maximum number of intersections and roads?

## Code

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function countPaths(n, roads) {
    // Graph representation using adjacency list
    const graph = new Map();
    
    roads.forEach(([u, v, time]) => {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, []);
        graph.get(u).push([v, time]);
        graph.get(v).push([u, time]);
    });
    
    const dist = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    const ways = Array(n).fill(0);
    dist[0] = 0;
    ways[0] = 1;
    
    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x[1] });
    
    pq.enqueue([0, 0]); // Start from node 0
    
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const [node, nodeDist] = pq.dequeue().element;
        
        if (nodeDist > dist[node]) continue;
        
        for (const [neighbor, time] of graph.get(node)) {
            const newDist = nodeDist + time;
            
            if (newDist < dist[neighbor]) {
                dist[neighbor] = newDist;
                ways[neighbor] = ways[node];
                pq.enqueue([neighbor, newDist]);
            } else if (newDist === dist[neighbor]) {
                ways[neighbor] = (ways[neighbor] + ways[node]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ways[n - 1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the graph**: \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of roads.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: The main operations in Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue take \(O((E + V) \cdot \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of intersections.

Overall, the complexity is \(O((E + V) \cdot \log V)\) which is efficient given typical constraints.
