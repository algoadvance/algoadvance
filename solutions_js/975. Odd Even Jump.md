[Leetcode 975. Odd Even Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l975)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called *odd numbered jumps*, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called *even numbered jumps*. 

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:

- During odd numbered jumps (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, then you jump to the smallest such index `j`.
- During even numbered jumps (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, then you jump to the smallest such index `j`.

It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more).

Return the number of good starting indices.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the constraint on the length of the array and the element values?**
    - The length of the array `arr` will be between `1` and `2 * 10^4`.
    - Each element in the array will be between `0` and `10^5`.
2. **What should be returned if no starting index is good?**
    - Return `0` in that case.
3. **Are the jumps strictly forward only?**
    - Yes, you can only jump to indices `j` where `j > i`.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding jumps:** We need to identify the indices we can jump to from each index, both for odd jumps and even jumps.
2. **Monotonous stacks:** Use stacks to efficiently find the next smallest and next largest indices for odd and even jumps, respectively.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Use two boolean arrays `odd` and `even`, where `odd[i]` represents whether we can reach the end starting from index `i` with an odd jump and `even[i]` represents the same for an even jump.

### Code

```javascript
function oddEvenJumps(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;

    // Helper function to create the next jump index array
    const createJumpArray = (indices, ascending) => {
        const result = Array(n).fill(-1);
        const stack = [];
        for (const i of indices) {
            while (stack.length > 0 && (ascending ? arr[stack[stack.length - 1]] <= arr[i] : arr[stack[stack.length - 1]] >= arr[i])) {
                result[stack.pop()] = i;
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return result;
    };

    // Indices sorted by value then by index ascending
    const sortedIndicesInc = [...Array(n).keys()].sort((a, b) => arr[a] === arr[b] ? a - b : arr[a] - arr[b]);
    const sortedIndicesDec = [...Array(n).keys()].sort((a, b) => arr[a] === arr[b] ? a - b : arr[b] - arr[a]);

    const nextHigher = createJumpArray(sortedIndicesInc, true);
    const nextLower = createJumpArray(sortedIndicesDec, false);

    const odd = Array(n).fill(false);
    const even = Array(n).fill(false);
    odd[n - 1] = even[n - 1] = true;

    let goodStartingIndices = 1;

    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nextHigher[i] !== -1) {
            odd[i] = even[nextHigher[i]];
        }
        if (nextLower[i] !== -1) {
            even[i] = odd[nextLower[i]];
        }
        if (odd[i]) {
            goodStartingIndices++;
        }
    }

    return goodStartingIndices;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the indices takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Creating the `nextHigher` and `nextLower` arrays can be done in \(O(n)\) using the stack method.
- Filling the `odd` and `even` arrays takes \(O(n)\).

So the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given constraints.
