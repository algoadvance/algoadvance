[Leetcode 225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l225)
## Problem Statement

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- `boolean empty()` Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:
- You must use **only** standard operations of a queue, which means only `enqueue` to the back, `dequeue` from the front, `size`, and `isEmpty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, you may use a list or deque (double-ended queue) to simulate a queue if a queue is not supported natively.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input bound within a specific range?**
   - There's no specific input limit mentioned, so we'll consider typical constraint ranges for stack sizes, e.g., integers and modestly sized data.

2. **Can we use collections such as Array or LinkedList to implement the queue?**
   - Yes, using an array (which supports queue operations) is fine for this implementation.

3. **Should we handle invalid operations, such as popping or peeking from an empty stack?**
   - These edge cases should be assumed to be handled correctly by either not occurring in test cases or by handling within the code if needed.

## Strategy

To implement a stack using two queues (`q1` and `q2`):
1. **Push Operation**:
    - Push the element into `q2`.
    - Dequeue all elements from `q1` and enqueue them into `q2`.
    - Swap the names of `q1` and `q2`.

2. **Pop Operation**:
    - Dequeue an element from `q1` (guaranteed to be the last pushed element due to the enqueue-dequeue operations in `push`).

3. **Top Operation**:
    - Peek the front element of `q1`.

4. **Empty Operation**:
    - Check if `q1` is empty.

By maintaining this strategy, we ensure that the `q1` always has the current stack state, and every push operation maintains the LIFO order.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
class MyStack {
    constructor() {
        this.q1 = [];
        this.q2 = [];
    }

    push(x) {
        // Push element x into q2
        this.q2.push(x);
        // Move all elements from q1 to q2
        while (this.q1.length) {
            this.q2.push(this.q1.shift());
        }
        // Swap names of q1 and q2
        [this.q1, this.q2] = [this.q2, this.q1];
    }

    pop() {
        return this.q1.shift();
    }

    top() {
        return this.q1[0];
    }

    empty() {
        return this.q1.length === 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Push operation**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the stack. Each push involves moving `n` elements.
2. **Pop operation**: O(1), since we dequeue the front element of `q1`.
3. **Top operation**: O(1), by accessing the front element of `q1`.
4. **Empty operation**: O(1), by checking the length of `q1`.

In summary:
- Push: O(n)
- Pop: O(1)
- Top: O(1)
- Empty: O(1)

This solution ensures correct stack behavior using queue operations.
