[Leetcode 2166. Design Bitset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2166)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a `Bitset` class that allows you to efficiently manage a bitset. The class should include the following functionalities:

1. `Bitset(size)` - Initializes the Bitset with the specified size, with all bits initially set to 0.
2. `fix(idx)` - Sets the bit at index `idx` to 1. If the bit is already set to 1, it does nothing.
3. `unfix(idx)` - Sets the bit at index `idx` to 0. If the bit is already set to 0, it does nothing.
4. `flip()` - Flips all the bits in the Bitset (all 0s become 1s and all 1s become 0s).
5. `all()` - Returns true if all the bits are set to 1; otherwise, returns false.
6. `one()` - Returns true if at least one bit is set to 1; otherwise, returns false.
7. `count()` - Returns the total number of bits that are set to 1.
8. `toString()` - Returns the Bitset as a string of binary digits (`'0'` and `'1'`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Behavior on Out of Bound Indices:** Should `fix` and `unfix` methods throw an error if the index is out of bounds?
2. **Thread Safety:** Is there any requirement for thread safety?
3. **Edge Case of Size 0:** Can the size be 0, and what would be the expected behavior in that case?

### Code

Below is a possible implementation of the Bitset class:

```javascript
class Bitset {
    constructor(size) {
        this.size = size;
        this.bits = new Array(size).fill(0);
        this.flipped = false;
        this.countOnes = 0;
    }
    
    fix(idx) {
        if (this.bits[idx] === (this.flipped ? 0 : 1)) return;
        this.bits[idx] = this.flipped ? 0 : 1;
        this.countOnes += this.flipped ? -1 : 1;
    }
    
    unfix(idx) {
        if (this.bits[idx] === (this.flipped ? 1 : 0)) return;
        this.bits[idx] = this.flipped ? 1 : 0;
        this.countOnes += this.flipped ? 1 : -1;
    }
    
    flip() {
        this.flipped = !this.flipped;
        this.countOnes = this.size - this.countOnes;
    }
    
    all() {
        return this.countOnes === this.size;
    }
    
    one() {
        return this.countOnes > 0;
    }
    
    count() {
        return this.countOnes;
    }
    
    toString() {
        return this.bits.map(bit => (this.flipped ? 1 - bit : bit)).join('');
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Representation of the Bitset**: Use an array `bits` to store the actual bits and a boolean `flipped` to represent whether we need to invert the bits logically.
2. **Fix and Unfix Operations**: Depending on the flipped status, perform the fix and unfix operations by checking the current state of the bit.
3. **Flip Operation**: Toggle the `flipped` status and adjust the count of 1s accordingly.
4. **Query Operations (all, one, count, toString)**: Implement the queries based on the current state of the bitset and whether it has been flipped.

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization (`constructor`)**: O(n), where n is the size of the Bitset, because we initialize an array of size n.
2. **Fix and Unfix (`fix` and `unfix`)**: O(1), constant time operations.
3. **Flip (`flip`)**: O(1), just toggling a boolean and updating the count.
4. **All, One, Count (`all`, `one`, `count`)**: O(1), straightforward computations.
5. **ToString (`toString`)**: O(n), as we need to iterate through the Bitset to form the string.

This implementation ensures efficient management of the Bitset while handling all required operations.
