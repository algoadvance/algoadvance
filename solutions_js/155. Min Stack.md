[Leetcode 155. Min Stack](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l155)
### Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if we try to pop or get the top element from an empty stack?
   **A:** Although it is usually an invalid operation, the problem statement assumes valid input according to typical interview constraints.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the value of integers (positive, negative, or zero)?
   **A:** There's no restriction mentioned. Hence, the stack should handle all integer values.

### Strategy

To achieve the desired functionality with constant time operations, we can use two stacks:
1. **Main Stack** to store all elements.
2. **Min Stack** to store the minimum elements encountered so far.

The `Min Stack` will keep track of the current minimum. Hereâ€™s how the methods will work:
- **Push**: 
  - Push the value to the `main stack`.
  - If the `min stack` is empty or the value is less than or equal to the top of the `min stack`, push the value onto the `min stack`.
- **Pop**:
  - Pop from the `main stack`.
  - If the popped value is the same as the top of the `min stack`, pop from the `min stack`.
- **Top**:
  - Return the top value from the `main stack`.
- **GetMin**:
  - The current minimum value is at the top of the `min stack`.

### Code

```javascript
class MinStack {
    constructor() {
        this.mainStack = [];
        this.minStack = [];
    }

    push(val) {
        this.mainStack.push(val);
        if (this.minStack.length === 0 || val <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.push(val);
        }
    }

    pop() {
        const poppedValue = this.mainStack.pop();
        if (poppedValue === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    top() {
        return this.mainStack[this.mainStack.length - 1];
    }

    getMin() {
        return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Push**: O(1), as both pushing onto the main stack and checking/pushing onto the min stack are constant time operations.
- **Pop**: O(1), as popping from both stacks (if needed) are constant time operations.
- **Top**: O(1), as accessing the top of the stack is a constant time operation.
- **GetMin**: O(1), as accessing the top of the min stack is a constant time operation.

This solution ensures that all operations meet the O(1) time complexity requirement, making it efficient and suitable for the problem's constraints.
