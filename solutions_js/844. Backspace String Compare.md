[Leetcode 844. Backspace String Compare](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l844)
### Problem Statement

**844. Backspace String Compare**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the inputs guaranteed to contain only lowercase letters and the `#` character?
  - Yes, the constraints specify that the strings will only contain these.
  
2. Is there an upper limit on the length of string `s` and `t`?
  - The constraints typically indicate an upper limit, possibly around 200 characters in coding interviews.

3. Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
  - Yes, the problem implies that it is case-sensitive since it states the input contains lowercase letters.

### Strategy

The main challenge here is to correctly apply the backspace operations represented by `#` and then compare the processed results of `s` and `t`.

The simplest way is to:

1. Iterate through each string.
2. Use a stack to simulate the text editor operation for each string as follows:
   - Push characters onto the stack.
   - Pop characters from the stack whenever a `#` is encountered.

After processing both strings, compare the resulting stacks.

### Code

```javascript
function backspaceCompare(s, t) {
    // Function to process the characters as per backspace rules
    const build = (str) => {
        const stack = [];
        for (const char of str) {
            if (char === '#') {
                if (stack.length > 0) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push(char);
            }
        }
        return stack;
    };

    // Process both strings
    const finalS = build(s);
    const finalT = build(t);

    // Compare the resulting stacks
    if (finalS.length !== finalT.length) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < finalS.length; i++) {
        if (finalS[i] !== finalT[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` respectively. We have to process each character of both strings once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for storing the intermediate results in the stacks.

This solution efficiently simulates the backspace behavior and then compares the final states of both strings.
