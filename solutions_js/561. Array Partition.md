[Leetcode 561. Array Partition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l561)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers, your task is to:
- Group these integers into `n` pairs `(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)` such that the sum of `min(ai, bi)` for all `i` is maximized.

Return the sum of `min(ai, bi)`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the order of elements) are:
1. (1, 4), (2, 3) → min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
2. (1, 3), (2, 4) → min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3
3. (1, 2), (3, 4) → min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4
So the maximum possible sum is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What are the constraints on the array? 
   - Typically, the length of the array `nums` will be even because it is specified to be `2n`.

2. Can there be negative numbers in the array?
   - Yes, the array can have both negative and positive numbers.

3. Do we need to return any specific output if the array is empty?
   - If the array is empty, it implies there are no pairs to consider, so we should return 0.

### Strategy:
1. **Sorting**: By sorting the array, we ensure that we can pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the sum of minimum values in each pair.
2. **Pair Formation**: Once sorted, take every two consecutive elements (`nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`) from the sorted array. The minimum of these two will be `nums[i]` because the array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Summation**: Sum up all the `nums[i]` (where `i` is even) from the sorted array.

### Code:
Here's how you can implement this strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrayPairSum = function(nums) {
    // Sort the array in ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let sum = 0;
    // Iterate over the array, stepping by 2
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
        sum += nums[i];
    }
    
    return sum;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is determined by:
1. Sorting the array, which takes `O(n log n)`.
2. Iterating through the array, which takes `O(n)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

By following this approach, we ensure that we maximize the sum of the minimum values in each pair, meeting the problem requirements efficiently.
