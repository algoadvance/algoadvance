[Leetcode 1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1665)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]`:

- `actuali` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `i-th` task.
- `minimumi` is the minimum amount of initial energy you need to start the `i-th` task.

For example, if the task is `[5, 10]`, you need a minimum energy of `10` units to start the task, but you will spend `5` units of energy to finish it.

You want to finish all the tasks. You are allowed to reorder the tasks in any way. Return the minimum initial energy you need to finish all the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `actual` and `minimum` values be the same or different for different tasks?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `actual` and `minimum`?
3. Can the `tasks` array be empty?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum initial energy required to complete all tasks, regardless of their order.

Let's follow these steps:
1. **Sorting Strategy**: We need to reorder the tasks to minimize the initial energy. A useful heuristic is to prioritize tasks that have a high difference between `minimum` and `actual` first. Sort the tasks by the difference `minimum - actual`, in descending order.
2. **Simulation**: Starting with zero initial energy, iterate through the sorted tasks and for each task, check if the current energy is sufficient. If not, adjust the initial energy needed.

### Code
```javascript
function minimumEffort(tasks) {
    // Sort tasks based on the difference (minimum - actual), in descending order
    tasks.sort((a, b) => (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]));

    let initialEnergy = 0;
    let currentEnergy = 0;

    for (let task of tasks) {
        let actual = task[0];
        let minimum = task[1];

        // If current energy isn't enough to start the task
        if (currentEnergy < minimum) {
            // Increase initial energy by the difference
            initialEnergy += (minimum - currentEnergy);
            // Adjust current energy to the minimum required
            currentEnergy = minimum;
        }

        // Perform the task
        currentEnergy -= actual;
    }

    return initialEnergy;
}

// Example usage
console.log(minimumEffort([[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 8]])); // Output: 8
console.log(minimumEffort([[1, 3], [2, 4], [10, 11], [10, 12], [8, 9]])); // Output: 32
console.log(minimumEffort([[1,7],[3,8],[2,10],[5,11]])); // Output: 17
```

### Debug
```javascript
// Test cases
console.log(minimumEffort([[1, 5], [2, 6], [4, 8]])); // Expected output based on strategy: 15
console.log(minimumEffort([[10, 12], [4, 8], [2, 5]])); // Expected output based on strategy: 21
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of tasks.
- **Iteration**: `O(n)` to accumulate the necessary energy.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is `O(n log n)` due to sorting.
