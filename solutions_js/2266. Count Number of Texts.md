[Leetcode 2266. Count Number of Texts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2266)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `pressedKeys` representing the sequence of keys you pressed on a phone keyboard. The mapping of keys to letters is analogous to the classic phone keyboard:

- '2': "abc"
- '3': "def"
- '4': "ghi"
- '5': "jkl"
- '6': "mno"
- '7': "pqrs"
- '8': "tuv"
- '9': "wxyz"

Return the total number of possible text messages that could have been typed. Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always valid i.e., composed only of digits from '2' to '9'?**
   - Yes, the input is always valid.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of pressedKeys?**
   - The typical constraint would be checking for length upto `10^5`.

3. **Should we consider different mappings having different allowable maximum repetition lengths?**
   - Yes, for instance:
     - '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '8' can be pressed at most 3 times consecutively.
     - '7', '9' can be pressed at most 4 times consecutively.

### Strategy

1. **Understand Constraints:**
   - Keys `2-6` and `8` can be repeated consecutively up to 3 times.
   - Keys `7` and `9` can be repeated consecutively up to 4 times.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to interpret the first `i` characters of `pressedKeys`.
   - Base case: `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to interpret an empty string).
   - For each digit in `pressedKeys`, consider up to 3 (or 4 for 7, 9) previous characters to form valid sequences.
  
3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each character `pressedKeys[i]`, accumulate possible counts from previous states (`dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD` for valid `j`).

### Code

```javascript
var countTexts = function(pressedKeys) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = pressedKeys.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    // Determine the maximum length of the sequence allowed for each key
    const maxLen = { '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3, '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4 };

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let maxCount = maxLen[pressedKeys[i - 1]]; // Look up max allowed repetitions for current digit
        for (let k = 0; k < maxCount && i - k - 1 >= 0; k++) {
            if (pressedKeys[i - 1] === pressedKeys[i - k - 1]) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - k - 1]) % MOD;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `pressedKeys`.
  - We loop through each character once and perform a constant amount of work for each character.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`.
  - We use an array `dp` of size `n + 1`.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.
