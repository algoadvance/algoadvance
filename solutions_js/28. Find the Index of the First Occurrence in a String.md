[Leetcode 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l28)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `haystack` and `needle`. Implement a function `strStr` to find the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or return `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example:**
1. Input: `haystack = "hello"`, `needle = "ll"`  
   Output: `2`
2. Input: `haystack = "aaaaa"`, `needle = "bba"`  
   Output: `-1`
3. Input: `haystack = ""`, `needle = ""`  
   Output: `0`

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if both `haystack` and `needle` are empty strings?
   - We should return `0` in this case.
2. What should be returned if `needle` is an empty string but `haystack` is not?
   - We should return `0` in this case, indicating that an empty substring is trivially found at the start.

### Strategy

We'll use a sliding window approach to compare the substring of `haystack` of the same length as `needle` and check for equality. This method ensures we scan through `haystack` up to a certain point, avoiding unnecessary comparisons when there are insufficient characters remaining in `haystack` to match `needle`.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function implementing the solution:

```javascript
function strStr(haystack, needle) {
    // Handle the edge case where needle is an empty string.
    if (needle === "") {
        return 0;
    }

    let haystackLength = haystack.length;
    let needleLength = needle.length;

    // Run a loop till the point where a match is still possible.
    for (let i = 0; i <= haystackLength - needleLength; i++) {
        // Get the substring of haystack from the current index of the same length as needle.
        let substring = haystack.substring(i, i + needleLength);
        if (substring === needle) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // If no match is found, return -1.
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O((n - m + 1) * m) where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`. In the worst case, we might perform up to (n - m + 1) comparisons, each taking O(m) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we are not using any additional data structures that depend on the input size.

This solution should suffice for typical interview conditions and common input sizes.
