[Leetcode 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1584)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the Manhattan distance between them: 
``` 
|xi - xj| + |yi - yj| 
```

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size and constraints:**
    - Can the number of points be very large?
    - What are the possible ranges for the coordinates?
 
2. **Output:**
    - Should we just return the cost as an integer?

### Strategy

The problem can be visualized as finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a graph where the vertices are the points and the edges are the possible connections between the points with weights given by the Manhattan distance.

To solve this:
1. **Compute all edges and their costs:** Calculate all the pairwise Manhattan distances between the points.
2. **Use MST algorithm:** Use either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm to find the MST.
   - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Sort all edges, and use Union-Find to add edges ensuring no cycles.
   - **Prim's Algorithm**: Use a priority queue to greedily add the minimum edge that connects a new point.

We will implement Prim's algorithm for this solution.

### Code

```javascript
function minCostConnectPoints(points) {
    const n = points.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    const adjList = new Array(n).fill().map(() => []);
    // Build the adjacency list with Manhattan distances
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            const cost = Math.abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + Math.abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1]);
            adjList[i].push([cost, j]);
            adjList[j].push([cost, i]);
        }
    }
    
    // Use a priority queue to implement Prim's algorithm
    const pq = new MinHeap();
    const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    pq.insert([0, 0]); // Starting with point 0 and 0 cost
    let totalCost = 0;
    let edgesUsed = 0;
    
    while (edgesUsed < n) {
        const [cost, point] = pq.extractMin();
        if (visited[point]) continue;
        
        visited[point] = true;
        totalCost += cost;
        edgesUsed++;
        
        for (const [nextCost, nextPoint] of adjList[point]) {
            if (!visited[nextPoint]) {
                pq.insert([nextCost, nextPoint]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return totalCost;
}

// MinHeap implementation
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    insert(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.bubbleUp();
    }
    
    extractMin() {
        this.swap(0, this.heap.length - 1);
        const min = this.heap.pop();
        this.bubbleDown();
        return min;
    }
    
    bubbleUp(index = this.heap.length - 1) {
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[parentIndex][0] <= this.heap[index][0]) break;
            this.swap(parentIndex, index);
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    bubbleDown(index = 0) {
        const len = this.heap.length;
        while (true) {
            const leftChild = 2 * index + 1;
            const rightChild = 2 * index + 2;
            let smallest = index;

            if (leftChild < len && this.heap[leftChild][0] < this.heap[smallest][0]) smallest = leftChild;
            if (rightChild < len && this.heap[rightChild][0] < this.heap[smallest][0]) smallest = rightChild;
            if (smallest === index) break;

            this.swap(index, smallest);
            index = smallest;
        }
    }
    
    swap(i, j) {
        [this.heap[i], this.heap[j]] = [this.heap[j], this.heap[i]];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building adjacency list:** \( O(n^2) \)
- **Prim's Algorithm:** \( O(E \log E) \) where \( E \) is \( n^2 \) (total pairs of points).

Overall, this approach is roughly \( O(n^2 \log n) \). This should be efficient for reasonably large values of \( n \).
