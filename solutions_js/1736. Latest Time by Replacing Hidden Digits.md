[Leetcode 1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1736)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the form of "HH:MM", where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by `?`). Replace all `?` with digits (0-9) to make the time as late as possible. The valid time format is in the 24-hour format.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input string always of length 5 and in the exact "HH:MM" format?
   - Yes.
2. Can we assume that the input has only digits and `?` marks?
   - Yes.

## Strategy
1. Examine the first character `time[0]` and set it to the highest possible value that keeps the hour valid:
   - If `time[0]` is `?`, set it to `'2'` or `'1'` depending on the second hour digit.
2. Examine the second character `time[1]` and set it to the highest possible value that keeps the hour valid:
   - If `time[0]` is `'2'`, set `time[1]` to `'3'` (latest valid hour in 24-hour format is `23`).
   - If `time[0]` is not `'2'`, set it to `'9'`.
3. Examine `time[3]` for the tens place of minutes:
   - If `time[3]` is `?`, set it to `'5'` (valid range is 0-59).
4. Examine `time[4]`for the unit place of minutes:
   - If `time[4]` is `?`, set it to `'9'`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} time
 * @return {string}
 */
var maximumTime = function(time) {
    let result = time.split('');
    
    // Determine the maximum possible hour
    if (result[0] === '?') {
        result[0] = (result[1] === '?' || result[1] < '4') ? '2' : '1';
    }
    if (result[1] === '?') {
        result[1] = (result[0] === '2') ? '3' : '9';
    }
    
    // Determine the maximum possible minutes
    if (result[3] === '?') {
        result[3] = '5';
    }
    if (result[4] === '?') {
        result[4] = '9';
    }
    
    return result.join('');
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumTime("2?:?0")); // Output: "23:50"
console.log(maximumTime("0?:3?")); // Output: "09:39"
console.log(maximumTime("1?:22")); // Output: "19:22"
console.log(maximumTime("?4:5?")); // Output: "14:59"
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the number of operations does not depend on the size of the input (the input is always of fixed length 5). The space complexity is also O(1) as only a fixed amount of extra space is used for the results.
