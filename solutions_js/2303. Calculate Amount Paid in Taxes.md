[Leetcode 2303. Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2303)
### Problem Statement
The problem 2303 on LeetCode titled "Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes" requires you to implement a function that calculates the amount of taxes paid based on a given array of tax brackets and an income.

You are given:
- `brackets`, a 2D integer array where each `brackets[i] = [upper_i, percent_i]` denotes that the percentage `percent_i` applies to income earned over the previous bracket but less than or equal to `upper_i`.
- `income`, an integer representing the income.

Your goal is to calculate the total amount of taxes paid based on these brackets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the brackets guaranteed to be in ascending order of income?**
   - Yes, the problem states that brackets are in order.

2. **Is the income guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   - Yes, the income will always be a non-negative integer.

3. **Are the percentages given as integers?**
   - Yes, the percentages for taxation will always be integers.

### Code

```javascript
function calculateTax(brackets, income) {
    let taxPaid = 0;
    let previousUpper = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
        let [upper, percent] = brackets[i];
        
        if (income > upper) {
            taxPaid += (upper - previousUpper) * percent / 100;
        } else {
            taxPaid += (income - previousUpper) * percent / 100;
            break;
        }
        
        previousUpper = upper;
    }
    
    return taxPaid;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(calculateTax([[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], 10));  // Output should be 2 + 0.7 = 2.7
console.log(calculateTax([[1, 10], [4, 20], [8, 30]], 10));  // Output should be 1*0.1 + 3*0.2 + 2*0.3 = 3.5
```

### Strategy
1. Initialize `taxPaid` to 0 and `previousUpper` to 0.
2. Iterate over each bracket.
3. For each bracket, if the income is higher than the upper limit of the current bracket:
   - Calculate the tax for the segment (`upper - previousUpper`) using the percentage given.
   - Update `taxPaid`.
   - Update `previousUpper` to the current `upper`.
4. If the income is less than or equal to the upper limit:
   - Calculate the tax from the remainder of the income (`income - previousUpper`) using the percentage given.
5. Return the total tax paid.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this function is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of tax brackets. This is because we only iterate over the brackets once and perform a constant amount of work for each bracket.
