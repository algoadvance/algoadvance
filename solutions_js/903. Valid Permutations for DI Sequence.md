[Leetcode 903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l903)
## Problem Statement

A permutation of an array of integers is called a valid permutation if for each pair of adjacent elements the following condition is true:

- 'I' means the next number is larger.
- 'D' means the next number is smaller.

Given a string `s`, where `s[i]` can be either 'I' (for increasing) or 'D' (for decreasing), your task is to count how many valid permutations of the array `[0, 1, ..., n]` can be generated that follow this DI (Decreasing or Increasing) sequence.

Return the number of valid permutations. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of `s`**: Is there an upper limit on the length of the string `s`?
2. **Valid Characters**: Can `s` contain any character other than 'I' and 'D'?
3. **Permutations**: Are we dealing with permutations of `[0, 1, ..., s.length]` for an `s` of length `n`? 

Given the constraints often present in coding problems, let's assume:
- `s` contains only 'I' and 'D'.
- Length of `s` can be large, typically up to a few hundred (e.g. 200-300).

## Strategy

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a fitting approach for this problem. We'll create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid permutations of the first `i+1` numbers (`[0, 1, ..., i]`) that end with the number `j`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize DP Table**: 
   - `dp[0][0] = 1` since there's only one way to arrange a single element.

2. **Iterate Over DP Table**:
   - For each index `i` in the string `s`, update the DP table based on whether `s[i]` is 'I' or 'D'.
     - For 'I': We want the current number to be larger, hence sum the appropriate previous values.
     - For 'D': We want the current number to be smaller, so sum the appropriate previous values.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

4. **Result Extraction**: The answer will be the sum of all valid permutations of length `n + 1` (i.e., `dp[n][j]` for all `j`).

### Dynamic Programming Transition:
- If `s[i] == 'I'`, `dp[i + 1][j]` should consider all `dp[i][k]` where `k < j`
- If `s[i] == 'D'`, `dp[i + 1][j]` should consider all `dp[i][k]` where `k > j`

### Code

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function numPermsDISequence(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    let dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        const temp = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
        if (s[i - 1] == 'I') {
            let sum = 0;
            for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                sum = (sum + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
                temp[j] = sum;
            }
        } else {
            let sum = 0;
            for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                sum = (sum + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
                temp[j] = sum;
            }
        }
        dp[i] = temp;
    }

    return dp[n].reduce((acc, val) => (acc + val) % MOD, 0);
}

// Example usage:
let s = "DID";
console.log(numPermsDISequence(s));  // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the 2D DP array.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) since we are filling an `n+1 x n+1` DP table and each cell requires linear time to update based on previous states.

This concludes the solution for counting valid permutations of a DI sequence in JavaScript.
