[Leetcode 3144. Minimum Substring Partition of Equal Character Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3144)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into the minimum number of substrings such that each character appears in the same frequency in each substring.

For example, if `s = "aabcbcbca"`, one possible partition is `["aa", "bcb", "cb", "ca"]`, because:
- In the substring "aa", 'a' appears twice.
- In the substring "bcb", 'b' and 'c' both appear once.
- In the substring "cb", 'c' and 'b' both appear once.
- In the substring "ca", 'c' and 'a' both appear once. 

Each character in `s` must appear the same number of times in each partition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string contain non-alphabet characters (e.g., numbers, symbols)?
   - No, the input string only contains lowercase alphabetic characters.

2. What should be done if the string cannot be partitioned to meet the requirements?
   - You may assume the input string can always be partitioned as required.

3. Is there any constraint on the length of the string `s`?
   - The string length can be assumed to be within a reasonable range where it is possible to solve the problem programmatically.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency:** Start by counting the frequency of each character in the given string.
2. **Iterate and Partition:** Iterate through the string and keep track of the frequency of characters in the current substring until making sure every character has appeared the same number of times in the current substring.partition.
3. **Finalize and Continue:** Once a valid partition is found where all character frequencies match the global frequency distribution, finalize that partition and continue from the next character.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var partitionEqualFrequencySubstrings = function(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    let result = [];
    
    // Count the global frequency of each character
    for (let char of s) {
        freq[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    let tempFreq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    let partitions = [];
    let i = 0;

    while (i < n) {
        let tempStr = "";
        tempFreq.fill(0);
        
        while (i < n) {
            let charIndex = s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
            tempFreq[charIndex]++;
            tempStr += s[i];
            i++;

            if (isValidPartition(tempFreq, freq, tempStr.length)) {
                break;
            }
        }

        partitions.push(tempStr);
    }

    return partitions;
};

/**
 * Helper function to determine if the current substring has
 * characters appearing in the same frequency as needed.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} tempFreq - Current substring frequency
 * @param {number[]} globalFreq - Global string frequency
 * @param {number} length - Current substring length
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function isValidPartition(tempFreq, globalFreq, length) {
    let currentPartFrequency = length / tempFreq.reduce((accum, val) => accum + (val > 0 ? 1 : 0), 0);

    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (tempFreq[i] !== 0 && tempFreq[i] / currentPartFrequency !== globalFreq[i] / globalFreq.reduce((accum, val) => accum + (val > 0 ? 1 : 0), 0)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting:** O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`. 
- **Partitioning:** Each character is being processed in the worst case once, hence another O(N) operation.
- **Validation:** Checking each partition is based on constant space (26 letters), so it is considered O(1).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(N).
