[Leetcode 2240. Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2240)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have, and two integers `cost1` and `cost2` indicating the cost of a pen and the cost of a pencil respectively. You need to determine the number of different ways you can buy pens and pencils such that the total cost does not exceed the given amount of money.

Return the number of different ways you can buy pens and pencils.

**Example:** 
```plaintext
Input: total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The 9 ways are:
(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2` be negative? 
    - No, they will always be non-negative integers.
  
2. What should happen if the costs are zero?
    - Since the cost of an item can't be zero (as it would make the solution infinite), we assume `cost1` and `cost2` will always be positive integers.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2`?
    - Typically, these values are within the range of 0 to 10^9.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a nested loop approach:

1. Iterate over possible numbers of pens you can buy starting from 0 until the total cost exceeds the amount of money you have.
2. For each possible number of pens, calculate the remaining money after buying those pens.
3. Compute the maximum number of pencils you can buy with the remaining money.
4. Sum up all the valid combinations.

## Code

```javascript
function waysToBuyPensPencils(total, cost1, cost2) {
    let count = 0;
    
    // Iterate over the number of pens we can buy
    for (let pens = 0; pens * cost1 <= total; pens++) {
        // Calculate the remaining money after buying 'pens' number of pens
        let remainingMoney = total - pens * cost1;
        
        // Calculate the maximum number of pencils we can buy with remaining money
        let maxPencils = Math.floor(remainingMoney / cost2);
        
        // Add the number of possible combinations with the current number of pens
        count += (maxPencils + 1);
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(waysToBuyPensPencils(20, 10, 5)); // Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(T / C1), where `T` is the total amount of money and `C1` is the cost of a pen.

- **Explanation:** The loop runs from 0 to `total / cost1`. Inside the loop, operations are O(1), making the overall complexity dependent only on the top loop.

This ensures we check all possible combinations efficiently within the constraints given.
