[Leetcode 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1616)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `a` and `b`, of the same length. You can choose an index and split both strings at this index, making a prefix and suffix from each string. You want to check if there is a way to split the two strings such that:

1. one of the formed prefixes and the other formed suffix create a palindrome.

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve such a split, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the split point be at the very beginning or the very end of the strings?**
   - Yes, the split can be at any index, including 0 (which would be an empty prefix and full suffix) and at the end (which would be a full prefix and empty suffix).
   
2. **What are the size constraints on string `a` and `b`?**
   - Typically, in coding challenges, the sizes are around 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^5.

3. **Can the strings contain non-alphabetic characters or is it strictly alphabetic?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, so we should assume any characters are allowed.

4. **Is there a guaranteed solution, or can it be such that no valid split exists?**
   - It is possible that no valid split exists, in which case we should return `false`.

### Strategy

1. We need to check if any prefix from one string combined with any suffix from the other string results in a palindrome.
2. We will loop through potential split points and form possible combinations.
3. For each split point, we will check:
    - `a_prefix + b_suffix`
    - `b_prefix + a_suffix`
4. To optimize, if the prefix matches the corresponding suffix in reverse, then we can perform checks for the middle portion only.
5. We can create a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy described:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} a
 * @param {string} b
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function checkPalindromeFormation(a, b) {
    // Helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome
    const isPalindrome = (s, low, high) => {
        while (low < high) {
            if (s[low] !== s[high]) {
                return false;
            }
            low++;
            high--;
        }
        return true;
    };
    
    // Main checking function combining a prefix and b suffix or vice-versa
    const check = (a, b) => {
        let i = 0;
        let j = b.length - 1;
        
        // Find the first characters that don't match
        while (i < j && a[i] === b[j]) {
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        
        // Check the remaining parts if it forms a palindrome
        return isPalindrome(a, i, j) || isPalindrome(b, i, j);
    };
    
    return check(a, b) || check(b, a);
}

// Example usage
console.log(checkPalindromeFormation("x", "y")); // False
console.log(checkPalindromeFormation("abdef", "fecab")); // True
console.log(checkPalindromeFormation("ulacfd", "jizalu")); // True
```

### Time Complexity

- Checking if two characters match and then verifying the substring as a palindrome is O(n).
- Since we are doing this for two scenarios (a with b and b with a), the overall time complexity is O(n).
- Thus, the solution is efficient and suitable even for large inputs up to the order of 10^5.

### Explanation

- The function `isPalindrome` checks if the substring from `low` to `high` is a palindrome.
- The function `check` checks for a valid split by comparing prefixes with suffixes and vice-versa.
- The main function `checkPalindromeFormation` tries both combinations (`a` with `b` and `b` with `a`) and returns `true` if any valid combination forms a palindrome.
