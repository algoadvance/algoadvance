[Leetcode 1837. Sum of Digits in Base K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1837)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` (in base 10) and an integer `k`, return the sum of the digits of `n` in base `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, `n` can range from 1 to 10^6, and `k` can range from 2 to 36. 

2. **Should I handle invalid inputs, such as `k` less than 2 or greater than 36?**
   - We'll assume valid inputs as per the problem constraints.

3. **Are there any performance constraints that need to be considered?**
   - Since `n` can be as large as 10^6, the algorithm should be efficient. Converting to different bases and summing digits should be manageable within these constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Convert `n` from base 10 to base `k`:**
   - Repeatedly divide `n` by `k` and keep track of the remainders, which represent the digits in the new base `k`.

2. **Sum the digits:**
   - While converting, accumulate the sum of the remainders (digits in base `k`).

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes this:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var sumBase = function(n, k) {
    let sum = 0;
    
    while (n > 0) {
        sum += n % k;
        n = Math.floor(n / k);
    }
    
    return sum;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(sumBase(34, 6));  // Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(log_k(n)): The number of operations is proportional to the number of digits of `n` in base `k`, which is approximately `log_k(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1): We are utilizing a constant amount of space for variables sum and n.

This algorithm performs efficiently for the given constraints and correctly handles the conversion and summing of digits in base `k`.
