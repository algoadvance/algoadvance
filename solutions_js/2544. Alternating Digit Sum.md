[Leetcode 2544. Alternating Digit Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2544)
## Problem Statement

**Alternating Digit Sum**

Given a positive integer `n`, return the sum of its digits such that each digit is multiplied by a value which alternates between 1 and -1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is `n` always a positive integer? 
    - What is the maximum possible value for `n`?

2. **Output Specifications:**
    - Should we return the sum as an integer?

Assuming `n` is a positive integer without specific constraints on size.

## Strategy

1. **Convert the Number:**
    - Convert the number `n` to a string to easily access each digit.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
    - Initialize a sum variable `sum` to store the result.
    - Use a flag or alternate directly by positional indexing to decide whether to add or subtract the current digit.

3. **Loop Through Each Digit:**
    - Iterate over the string representation of `n`.
    - Convert each character back to an integer.
    - Add or subtract the integer value from the sum based on its position (odd/even index).

4. **Return the Result:**
    - Finally, return the value of sum.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function alternatingDigitSum(n) {
    // Convert the number to string to easily access each digit
    const numStr = n.toString();
    
    // Initialize sum
    let sum = 0;
    
    // Loop through each digit
    for (let i = 0; i < numStr.length; i++) {
        // Extract digit value
        const digit = parseInt(numStr[i], 10);
        
        // Determine if we should add or subtract this digit
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            sum += digit;  // Add for even index
        } else {
            sum -= digit;  // Subtract for odd index
        }
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is **O(d)**, where **d** is the number of digits in the number `n`. This is because we visit and process each digit exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(d) due to storing the string representation of `n`.
- For the given problem constraints, this space usage is typically negligible.

By following these steps and the above implementation, we can solve the problem of calculating the alternating digit sum efficiently.
