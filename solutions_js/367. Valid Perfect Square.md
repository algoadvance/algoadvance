[Leetcode 367. Valid Perfect Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l367)
### Problem Statement:

**LeetCode 367: Valid Perfect Square**

Given a positive integer `num`, write a function which returns True if `num` is a perfect square else False.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 16
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 14
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What is the largest value of `num` that we need to handle?
   **A:** According to the problem constraints, `num` is a positive integer, with the typical constraint being up to \(2^{31} - 1\).
   
2. **Q:** Can we use built-in mathematical functions like `sqrt`?
   **A:** While we could use these functions, the ideal solution should avoid them to demonstrate understanding of the underlying algorithms.

### Strategy:

To determine whether a number is a perfect square, we can use several approaches:
1. **Binary Search:** Efficiently narrow down the range of possible square roots.
2. **Newton's Method:** An iterative method to find the square root.

We'll use the binary search method due to its straightforward implementation and efficiency.

### Code:

```javascript
var isPerfectSquare = function(num) {
    if (num < 1) return false; // Handle small numbers.
    
    let left = 1;
    let right = num;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let square = mid * mid;
        
        if (square === num) {
            return true;
        } else if (square > num) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};

// Test cases
console.log(isPerfectSquare(16)); // true
console.log(isPerfectSquare(14)); // false
console.log(isPerfectSquare(1)); // true
console.log(isPerfectSquare(0)); // false
```

### Time Complexity:

**Time Complexity: O(log n)**
- The binary search approach divides the problem size by two each time, which results in a logarithmic complexity relative to the input size.

**Space Complexity: O(1)**
- We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables `left`, `right`, `mid`, and `square`.

This ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient for large input values.
