[Leetcode 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2136)
## Problem Statement
You have `n` plants. You are given two integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, both of size `n`:
- `plantTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes to plant the `i-th` plant.
- `growTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes to grow the `i-th` plant after being completely planted.

Each plant can only be planted after the previous one is completely grown (no simultaneous planting). Return the earliest possible day where all the plants are fully grown.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there any particular order in planting the plants?**
   The order of planting is to be determined for an optimal solution.

2. **Are `plantTime` and `growTime` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   Yes, both arrays contain non-negative integers only.

3. **What is the maximum size of `n`?**
   The maximum size of `n` is not specified, so we should aim for an optimal solution.

4. **Can the values in `plantTime` or `growTime` arrays be zero?**
   Yes, theoretically the values can be zero, though we should check function constraints if any are specified.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to determine an optimal order in planting to minimize the overall completion time. The goal is to take into account both planting time and growing time. 

### Key Insights:
1. **Order Consideration**: 
   The combined timeline for each plant is `plantTime[i] + growTime[i]`. We can order these to maximize the overlap of planting and growing stages. Specifically:
   
2. **Prioritization**:
   We should plant the seeds that have the longest growing time first, as these will be bottlenecks in our timeline.

### Steps:
1. **Pair and Sort**: Combine the `plantTime` and `growTime` into pairs and sort them in descending order based on `growTime`.
2. **Simulate Planting Process**: 
   - Use a current day counter to track the day that the planting completes.
   - Keep a maximum time to track the overall time when the last plant will be fully grown.

## Code

```javascript
const earliestFullBloom = (plantTime, growTime) => {
    const n = plantTime.length;

    // Combine plantTime and growTime, and sort based on growTime descending 
    const plants = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        plants.push([plantTime[i], growTime[i]]);
    }
    plants.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

    let currentDay = 0;
    let maxTime = 0;

    for (const [plant, grow] of plants) {
        currentDay += plant; // Increment day by plant time
        maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, currentDay + grow); // Check the max full bloom day
    }

    return maxTime;
};

// Example usage
const plantTime = [1, 2, 3, 2];
const growTime = [2, 1, 2, 1];
console.log(earliestFullBloom(plantTime, growTime));  // Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting Step**: O(n log n) due to sorting the plants array by growTime.
- **Greedy Simulation**: O(n), where we simulate the planting process.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log n). This is efficient for large values of `n`.

Feel free to test with various cases and check for edge cases like when arrays have length 1 or contain zero values.
