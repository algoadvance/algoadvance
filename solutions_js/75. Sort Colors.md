[Leetcode 75. Sort Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l75)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` containing `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sorted in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the input array contains only 0s, 1s, and 2s?**
   Yes, the problem statement implies that only the integers 0, 1, and 2 will be present in the input array.
   
2. **Do we need to maintain the relative order of elements with the same value?**
   No, maintaining the relative order is not necessary as the main goal is to sort the colors.

3. **Is there any constraint on the space complexity?**
   The problem requires sorting in-place, so we should aim for O(1) additional space.

## Strategy
We can use the Dutch National Flag algorithm to solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time and O(1) space. This algorithm utilizes three pointers (`low`, `mid`, and `high`) to partition the list into three parts:
- The section before `low` will contain all the 0s (red).
- The section between `low` and `mid` will contain all the 1s (white).
- The section after `high` will contain all the 2s (blue).
- `mid` will process each element to ensure correct placement.

## Code
Let's implement the Dutch National Flag algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    let low = 0;
    let mid = 0;
    let high = nums.length - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] === 0) {
            // Swap nums[low] and nums[mid], increment low and mid
            [nums[low], nums[mid]] = [nums[mid], nums[low]];
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] === 1) {
            // Mid is in correct position, just move mid pointer
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] === 2) {
            // Swap nums[mid] and nums[high], decrement high
            [nums[mid], nums[high]] = [nums[high], nums[mid]];
            high--;
        }
    }
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0];
sortColors(nums);
console.log(nums);  // Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once by the `mid` pointer and possibly once more during a swap).

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are only using a few extra variables (`low`, `mid`, and `high`) and performing the sort in-place.
