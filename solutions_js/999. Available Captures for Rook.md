[Leetcode 999. Available Captures for Rook](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l999)
### Problem Statement
Given a chessboard represented as an 8x8 matrix filled with the characters 'R', 'p', 'B', and '.', where:
- 'R' represents a rook,
- 'p' represents a pawn,
- 'B' represents a bishop,
- '.' represents an empty square.

You need to find the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move. The rook moves horizontally or vertically and cannot move across the bishops.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there always exactly one rook on the board?**
    - Yes, there is always exactly one rook on the board.
2. **What is the valid range of indices I need to consider?**
    - The board is always an 8x8 matrix, so indices range from 0 to 7.
3. **Can there be multiple pieces in the line of sight of the rook, and if so, do we stop when encountering the first obstacle?**
    - Yes, the rook stops moving when it encounters the first obstacle ('p' or 'B') in any direction.

### Strategy
1. Locate the position of the rook 'R'.
2. Move in all four possible directions (left, right, up, down) from this position.
3. For each direction, continue moving until you:
    - Capture a pawn ('p') and increment your counter.
    - Hit a bishop ('B') or the edge of the board, at which point you stop moving in that direction.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the described approach:

```javascript
function numRookCaptures(board) {
    let rookX, rookY;
    
    // Locate the rook on the board
    for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'R') {
                rookX = i;
                rookY = j;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    let captures = 0;
    
    // Directions: up, down, left, right
    const directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]];
    
    for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
        let x = rookX;
        let y = rookY;
        
        while (true) {
            x += dx;
            y += dy;
            
            // Check if out of bounds
            if (x < 0 || x >= 8 || y < 0 || y >= 8) {
                break;
            }
            
            // If there's a bishop, stop moving in this direction
            if (board[x][y] === 'B') {
                break;
            }
            
            // If capture a pawn
            if (board[x][y] === 'p') {
                captures++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return captures;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1). Since the board size is fixed at 8x8, the time taken to find the rook and check all 4 directions is constant.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

This solution checks each direction from the rook until it reaches the boundary of the board or hits an obstacle, counting any pawns it captures along the way.
