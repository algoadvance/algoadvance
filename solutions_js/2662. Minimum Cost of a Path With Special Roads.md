[Leetcode 2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2662)
## Problem Statement

You're given the start and end coordinates of a grid, and a list of special roads. Each special road is represented by an array `[x1, y1, x2, y2, cost]` which means you can travel from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` with a certain cost. The task is to find the minimum cost to travel from the start to the end.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the grid size?**
   - There's no explicit grid size mentioned, the coordinates are arbitrary.

2. **Are the coordinates positive or can they be negative?**
   - Coordinates can be negative or positive since there's no restriction provided.

3. **Can we only travel on special roads or can we move freely in the grid?**
   - You can move freely in the grid but using special roads may help minimize the overall cost.

4. **What's the cost of traveling between any two grid points within the grid freely?**
   - The cost is equivalent to the Manhattan distance between those two points, which is defined as `|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a shortest path algorithm (like Dijkstra's algorithm) on a graph where:
- Nodes represent points on the grid (including start, end, and all special road points).
- Edges represent either the Manhattan distance between two points or the specified cost of special roads.

### Steps:

1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Initialize nodes for the start, end, and all special road points.
   - Add edges between all pairs of points based on the Manhattan distance.
   - Override/add edges based on the special roads' given costs.

2. **Apply Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
   - Use a priority queue to always extend the least-cost path.

3. **Calculate Costs:**
   - Keep track of the minimum cost to reach the end from the start.

## Code

```javascript
function minCostPathWithSpecialRoads(start, end, specialRoads) {
    const [startX, startY] = start;
    const [endX, endY] = end;

    const points = new Set();
    points.add(`${startX},${startY}`);
    points.add(`${endX},${endY}`);
    for (const [x1, y1, x2, y2, cost] of specialRoads) {
        points.add(`${x1},${y1}`);
        points.add(`${x2},${y2}`);
    }

    const nodes = Array.from(points).map(point => {
        const [x, y] = point.split(',').map(Number);
        return { x, y };
    });

    const graph = new Map();

    for (const { x: x1, y: y1 } of nodes) {
        graph.set(`${x1},${y1}`, []);
        for (const { x: x2, y: y2 } of nodes) {
            if (x1 !== x2 || y1 !== y1) {
                const cost = Math.abs(x2 - x1) + Math.abs(y2 - y1);
                graph.get(`${x1},${y1}`).push({ cost, point: `${x2},${y2}` });
            }
        }
    }

    for (const [x1, y1, x2, y2, cost] of specialRoads) {
        graph.get(`${x1},${y1}`).push({
            cost,
            point: `${x2},${y2}`,
        });
    }

    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x.cost });
    pq.enqueue({ point: `${startX},${startY}`, cost: 0 });
    const distances = new Map();
    for (const point of points) {
        distances.set(point, Infinity);
    }
    distances.set(`${startX},${startY}`, 0);

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const { point, cost: currentCost } = pq.dequeue();
        if (point === `${endX},${endY}`) {
            return currentCost;
        }
        for (const { cost, point: neighbor } of graph.get(point)) {
            const newCost = currentCost + cost;
            if (newCost < distances.get(neighbor)) {
                distances.set(neighbor, newCost);
                pq.enqueue({ point: neighbor, cost: newCost });
            }
        }
    }
    
    return Infinity; // we should never hit this line if the end is reachable
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of points (including start, end, and special road points).
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** `O(E + V log V)` where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges. Since the graph is dense, this simplifies to about `O(n^2 log n)`.

The overall complexity is dominated by the Dijkstra's algorithm, resulting in `O(n^2 log n)`.
