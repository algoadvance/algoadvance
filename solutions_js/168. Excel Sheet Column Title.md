[Leetcode 168. Excel Sheet Column Title](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l168)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `columnNumber` that represents the column number in an Excel sheet. You need to return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:
- 1 -> "A"
- 2 -> "B"
- 3 -> "C"
- ...
- 26 -> "Z"
- 27 -> "AA"
- 28 -> "AB"

The function signature is `function convertToTitle(columnNumber: number): string`.

## Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, here are some clarifying questions and assumptions:
1. What is the range of the column number? 
   - The column number will be a positive integer and, practically, it will be within the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647 (maximum for a 32-bit signed integer).
2. Should the solution handle large numbers efficiently?
   - Yes, the solution should handle up to the maximum value specified efficiently.

## Strategy

To convert a number to a column title, we use a modified base-26 numeral system where:
- 'A' corresponds to 1,
- 'B' corresponds to 2,
- ...
- 'Z' corresponds to 26.

The key difference to note here from a standard numeral system is that there is no zero. Therefore, we will work through the following steps:
1. Decrease the column number by 1 (`columnNumber--`). This adjustment is necessary because Excel columns are 1-indexed, but our calculation will be easier if we treat them as 0-indexed.
2. Find the remainder when dividing the adjusted column number by 26. This remainder corresponds to the last character of the column title.
3. Convert the remainder to a character ('A' + remainder).
4. Reduce the column number using integer division by 26 to process the next significant digit.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the column number is reduced to zero.

## Code

```javascript
function convertToTitle(columnNumber) {
    let result = '';
    while (columnNumber > 0) {
        columnNumber--; // Adjust for 1-indexed system transforming it to 0-indexed.
        let char = String.fromCharCode((columnNumber % 26) + 'A'.charCodeAt(0));
        result = char + result;
        columnNumber = Math.floor(columnNumber / 26);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\log_{26} n)\), where \(n\) is the column number. This is because in each iteration of the loop, the number is divided by 26. Given the constraints, this approach will efficiently handle even the largest possible column numbers in a reasonable time frame.
