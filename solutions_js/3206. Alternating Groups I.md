[Leetcode 3206. Alternating Groups I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3206)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, we'll define a group as a series of consecutive characters that are the same. In the input string, groups will always consist of exactly two alternating characters, where each character in a group is repeated one or more times.

Your task is to print the lengths of these alternating groups. For example, given the input string:

    "aaabbbdfccccaa?"

Output the lengths of the alternating groups:

    [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1]

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the string always contain at least one character?**
   Yes, the problem implicitly assumes that, but you should confirm.

2. **Can the string contain any characters including special symbols?**
   Yes.

3. **Should isolated characters be considered as groups?**
   Yes, any character, even if it appears alone, should be considered a group.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Create an empty array to hold the lengths of the groups.
2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - Keep a counter to count the length of the current group.
   - For each character, check if it's the same as the previous character:
     - If so, increment the counter.
     - If not, store the current count in the array and reset the counter to 1 for the new group.
3. **Handle the last group:** After the loop ends, store the count of the last group.
4. **Return the array of group lengths.**

### Code
```javascript
function alternatingGroups(s) {
    if (s.length === 0) return [];

    let groupLengths = [];
    let currentCount = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) {
            currentCount++;
        } else {
            groupLengths.push(currentCount);
            currentCount = 1;
        }
    }
    // For the last group
    groupLengths.push(currentCount);

    return groupLengths;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(alternatingGroups("aaabbbdfccccaa?")); // Output: [3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
The solution involves a single scan through the string, making it an O(n) operation, where n is the length of the string.
