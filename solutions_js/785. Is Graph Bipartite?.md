[Leetcode 785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l785)
### Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph, determine if it is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V, such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.

You can represent the graph as an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` is a list of vertices `i` is connected to. Return `true` if and only if it is bipartite.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`e`) in the graph?**
   - The graph contains `n` vertices where `1 <= n <= 100`.
   - Each node can have between `0` and `n-1` edges.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the edge weights?**
   - The edges are unweighted.

3. **Can the graph contain cycles?**
   - Yes, the graph can contain cycles since it is undirected and we need to determine if it can still be bipartite in the presence of cycles.

4. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - No, the graph might not be connected, and we need to ensure bipartiteness for all components.

### Strategy

To determine if the graph is bipartite, we can use a graph coloring approach. Here's the plan:

1. **Coloring**:
    - Use an array `colors` where `colors[i]` can be:
        - `0` if the vertex `i` is not colored.
        - `1` if the vertex `i` is colored with the first color.
        - `-1` if the vertex `i` is colored with the second color.
        
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Use BFS to try to color the graph. Start with any uncolored vertex, color it with the first color (`1`), and color all its adjacent vertices with the second color (`-1`).
    - If we find a neighboring vertex which is already colored with the same color as the current vertex, the graph is not bipartite.

3. **Repeat for All Components**:
    - Since the graph might be disconnected, we need to ensure bipartiteness for all its components by starting a BFS from every uncolored vertex.

### Code

```javascript
var isBipartite = function(graph) {
    const n = graph.length;
    const colors = new Array(n).fill(0); // 0: not colored, 1: color 1, -1: color 2

    const bfs = (start) => {
        const queue = [start];
        colors[start] = 1; // Start coloring with 1
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const node = queue.shift();
            for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
                if (colors[neighbor] === 0) {
                    // Neighbor has not been colored, color it with opposite color
                    colors[neighbor] = -colors[node];
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                } else if (colors[neighbor] === colors[node]) {
                    // Neighbor is colored with the same color => not bipartite
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (colors[i] === 0) {
            if (!bfs(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. This is because we process each vertex and each edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V)` where `V` is the number of vertices due to the space used for the `colors` array and the BFS queue.

This approach ensures that we properly check for bipartiteness across all components of the graph.
