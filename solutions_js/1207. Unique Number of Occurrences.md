[Leetcode 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1207)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, write a function that returns `true` if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2, and 3 has 1. No two values' number of occurrences are the same.

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers? 
    - Yes, integers in the array can be negative.
2. What is the range of the array size?
    - The constraints are not explicitly mentioned, but you should assume the input size can be large.
3. Can the array be empty?
    - For the given problem, it can be assumed an empty array would return `true`.

## Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we'll count the frequency of each element in the array using a hashmap (or object in JavaScript).
2. **Count Frequency of Frequencies**: Next, we'll use another set to track the frequencies of occurrence counts.
3. **Check Uniqueness**: Finally, we'll verify that all frequencies are unique by ensuring no duplicates in the set of frequencies.

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the frequency map takes O(n) time where n is the length of the array.
- Constructing the set of frequencies also takes O(n) time.
- The overall time complexity is O(n).

## Code

```javascript
function uniqueOccurrences(arr) {
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
    const frequencyMap = {};
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (frequencyMap[num]) {
            frequencyMap[num]++;
        } else {
            frequencyMap[num] = 1;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Use a set to store the frequencies and check for uniqueness
    const occurrenceSet = new Set();
    for (let key in frequencyMap) {
        if (occurrenceSet.has(frequencyMap[key])) {
            return false; // Duplicate frequency found
        }
        occurrenceSet.add(frequencyMap[key]);
    }

    return true;
}
```

The function `uniqueOccurrences` follows the outlined strategy to count occurrences and verify their uniqueness using a Set. This ensures that the solution is clear and adheres to the problem requirements.
