[Leetcode 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1489)
## Problem Statement

You are given a graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a weighted undirected edge between nodes `from_i` and `to_i`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connect all nodes without cycles and with a minimal total edge weight.

A critical edge is an edge that, if removed from the graph, causes the MST to have a larger weight. A pseudo-critical edge is an edge that can appear in some MSTs but is not necessarily in all MSTs.

You need to find all critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph and return them in lists respectively: `critical` and `pseudoCritical`.

```plaintext
Example:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2], [0, 3, 2], [0, 4, 3], [3, 4, 3], [1, 4, 6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be parallel edges between the same pair of nodes?
2. Is it guaranteed that the graph will be connected?
3. Is the input always valid, i.e., does no edge have negative weights?

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Edges:** Begin by sorting the list of edges in ascending order by weight.
   
2. **Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) weight:** Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST of the entire graph and note its weight.

3. **Identify Critical Edges:**
   - For each edge, remove it and calculate the MST weight of the remaining edges.
   - If the MST weight increases or if we can't form an MST (graph remains disconnected), the edge is critical.

4. **Identify Pseudo-Critical Edges:**
   - For each edge, forcibly include it in the MST and calculate the MST weight with this constraint.
   - If the MST weight is the same as the original MST weight, it is a pseudo-critical edge.

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
  constructor(size) {
    this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
    this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
  }

  find(x) {
    if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
      this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
    }
    return this.parent[x];
  }

  union(x, y) {
    let rootX = this.find(x);
    let rootY = this.find(y);
    
    if (rootX !== rootY) {
      if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
      } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
      } else {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        this.rank[rootX] += 1;
      }
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}

function findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges) {
  // Add original index to each edge
  edges = edges.map((edge, index) => [...edge, index]);
  
  // Sort edges based on weight
  edges.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2]);
  
  // Function to compute MST weight
  const kruskal = (n, edges, includeEdge = null, excludeEdge = null) => {
    let uf = new UnionFind(n);
    let weight = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    // If there is an includeEdge, include it first
    if (includeEdge !== null) {
      let [u, v, w] = edges[includeEdge];
      uf.union(u, v);
      weight += w;
      count++;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
      if (i === excludeEdge) continue;
      let [u, v, w] = edges[i];
      if (uf.union(u, v)) {
        weight += w;
        count++;
      }
    }

    // If we have n - 1 edges, we have a valid MST
    return count === n - 1 ? weight : Infinity;
  };

  const mstWeight = kruskal(n, edges);
  const critical = [];
  const pseudoCritical = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
    // Test critical
    if (kruskal(n, edges, null, i) > mstWeight) {
      critical.push(edges[i][3]);
    } else if (kruskal(n, edges, i, null) === mstWeight) {
      // Test pseudo-critical
      pseudoCritical.push(edges[i][3]);
    }
  }

  return [critical, pseudoCritical];
}

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2], [0, 3, 2], [0, 4, 3], [3, 4, 3], [1, 4, 6]];
console.log(findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges)); // [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the edges:** `O(E log E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
2. **Kruskal's algorithm:** approximately `O(E log V)` where `V` is the number of vertices because of the union-find operations.
3. **Identifying critical and pseudo-critical edges:** Each edge requires two MST calculations, leading to a time complexity of approximately `2E * E log V`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(E^2 log V)`, which should be manageable given typical constraints.
