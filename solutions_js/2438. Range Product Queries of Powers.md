## Problem Statement

**2438. Range Product Queries of Powers**

You are given a positive integer `n`, represented as `2^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri]` denote the range for the ith query.

The task is to compute the product of the integers in the range `[li, ri]` in the sequence of all powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^n inclusive for each query, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 12, queries = [[0,1], [2,3], [0,3]]
Output: [2, 64, 128]
Explanation: Powers of 2 up to 2^12 are [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. When computing the product for a range, should we include both the start and end indices of the range?
   - **Answer:** Yes, both `li` and `ri` are inclusive.
2. Should the result be modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - **Answer:** Yes.
3. Can the input size for queries affect the performance to an extent where an optimized solution is necessary?
   - **Answer:** Yes, optimizing the multiplicative operations to avoid overflow and unnecessary computations is necessary.

## Strategy

1. **Generating Powers of 2:** 
   - First, generate a list of all powers of 2 up to `2^n`. This is straightforward since these values grow exponentially in a predictable manner.
   
2. **Handling Queries Efficiently:**
   - For each query, compute the product of the powers in the given range `[li, ri]`.
   - Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the values do not become unmanageably large, preventing overflow and optimizing performance.

## Time Complexity

- Generating the list of powers of 2 takes O(n) time.
- Each query operation to compute the product will be O(k) where k is the range length (`ri - li + 1`).
- Thus, the overall time complexity for handling all queries is O(Q*k) where Q is the number of queries.

Letâ€™s proceed with implementing this in JavaScript.

## Code

```javascript
// Function to handle range product queries of powers
var rangeProductQueries = function(n, queries) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

    // Generate all powers of 2 up to 2^n
    let powers = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        powers.push(2 ** i);
    }

    // Function to calculate the product given the range
    const calculateProduct = (start, end) => {
        let product = 1;
        for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            product = (product * powers[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return product;
    };

    // Resultant array
    let results = [];
    for (let [li, ri] of queries) {
        results.push(calculateProduct(li, ri));
    }

    return results;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(rangeProductQueries(12, [[0, 1], [2, 3], [0, 3]])); // Output: [2, 64, 128]
```

This function generates powers of 2 up to `2^n`, then processes each query to calculate the product of the range specified, applying the modulo at each multiplication step to manage large numbers efficiently.
