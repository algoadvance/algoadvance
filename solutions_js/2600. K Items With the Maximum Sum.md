[Leetcode 2600. K Items With the Maximum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2600)
### Problem Statement
You are given three integers `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`. You have a bag containing:
- `numOnes` ones (1)
- `numZeros` zeros (0)
- `numNegOnes` negative ones (-1)

You are also given an integer `k`. Your goal is to select exactly `k` items from the bag in such a way that their sum is maximized. Return the maximum possible sum.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `k` be greater than the total number of items in the bag?
   - **A:** No, assume that `k` will always be less than or equal to the total number of items in the bag.

2. **Q:** Are the values of `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - **A:** Yes.

3. **Q:** Can we assume that the input will always be valid and within expected constraints?
   - **A:** Yes.

### Code
```javascript
function kItemsWithMaximumSum(numOnes, numZeros, numNegOnes, k) {
    // Maximum possible number of ones we can take is the smaller of 'numOnes' and 'k'
    let takenOnes = Math.min(numOnes, k);
    k -= takenOnes; // Reduce k by the number of ones taken
    
    // Since zeros do not affect the sum, we only need to consider if there are leftover items to pick
    let takenZeros = Math.min(numZeros, k);
    k -= takenZeros; // Reduce k by the number of zeros taken
    
    // Any remaining k should be taken from -1's i.e., numNegOnes
    let takenNegOnes = k; // No need to do min(numNegOnes, k) since k <= numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes
    
    // The sum will be the number of ones taken minus the number of negative ones taken
    return takenOnes - takenNegOnes;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(kItemsWithMaximumSum(3, 2, 2, 4)); // Output: 3
console.log(kItemsWithMaximumSum(3, 2, 2, 5)); // Output: 3
console.log(kItemsWithMaximumSum(3, 2, 2, 6)); // Output: 2
```

### Strategy
1. **Taking Maximum Ones:** Start by taking as many `1`s as possible because they add the most value to the sum. This is limited by the smaller of `numOnes` or `k`.
2. **Consider Zeros:** Since `0`s do not affect the sum, take them only if there are leftover items to pick after taking the maximum possible `1`s.
3. **Handle Negatives:** Finally, if there are still items left to pick (`k > 0`), take them as `-1`s which decrease the sum.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\) because the operations we perform are simple arithmetic calculations and do not depend on the size of the input values.
