[Leetcode 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1910)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `s` and `part`. Your task is to remove all occurrences of the substring `part` from the string `s` and return the result string.

For example:
- Input: `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `part = "abc"`
- Output: `"dab"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the `part` string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, you may assume `part` is always a non-empty substring.
  
2. **How should we handle overlapping substrings?**
   - Remove the substrings in a greedy manner. After removing one occurrence, if a new one appears, continue removing until there are no more occurrences.

3. **Can the input strings contain special characters?**
   - Yes, but they will be treated just like any other characters.

### Strategy

1. Use a loop to continuously search for the substring `part` in the string `s`.
2. If found, remove it by slicing the string around the found part.
3. Keep repeating this process until the substring `part` is no longer found in `s`.
4. Return the modified string `s`.

### Code

```javascript
function removeOccurrences(s, part) {
    let idx;
    while ((idx = s.indexOf(part)) !== -1) {
        s = s.substring(0, idx) + s.substring(idx + part.length);
    }
    return s;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(removeOccurrences("daabcbaabcbc", "abc")); // Output: "dab"
console.log(removeOccurrences("axxxxyyyyb", "xy"));    // Output: "ab"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is determined by two operations:
  - Finding the substring `part` within `s`.
  - Removing the substring and concatenating the new string.

1. **Finding the substring**: Each `indexOf` call takes O(n) time.
2. **String slicing and concatenation**: Each slicing operation involves creating new strings and takes O(n) time.

In the worst case, if we need to remove the substring from `s` very frequently (e.g., every time we remove `part`, it immediately reappears), the overall time complexity would be O((n * m) / k) where:
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `m` is the length of `part`.
- `k` is the length reduction per removal operation.

In a simplified analysis, the time complexity is approximately O(n * (n/m)), which simplifies to O(n^2) considering multiple iterations.

In practice, this quadratic time complexity might be acceptable for moderately sized strings, but can become a bottleneck for very large inputs.
