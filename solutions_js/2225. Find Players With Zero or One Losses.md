[Leetcode 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2225)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winner_i, loser_i]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated player `loser_i` in a match.

Return a list `answer` of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all players who have not lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players who have lost exactly one match.

The lists in `answer` should be sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of matches or players?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints, but it is safe to assume the input size is manageable to perform operations like sorting and counting losses.

2. **Can a player be both a winner and a loser?**
   - Yes, a player can win some matches and lose others.

3. **Are there duplicate matches in the input array?**
   - Duplicate matches should be treated as separate matches. It is possible that the same match `[winner, loser]` can appear multiple times in the input.

4. **What should be the format for the output lists?**
   - The lists should contain unique player IDs sorted in increasing order.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a `Set` for tracking players who have not lost any matches.
   - Use a `Map` to track the number of losses per player.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize an empty `Set` named `winnersSet` to keep track of players who have won at least one match.
   - Initialize an empty `Map` named `lossesCount` to count the number of losses for each player.
   - Iterate through each match in `matches`:
     - Add the winner to the `winnersSet`.
     - Increment the count of losses for the loser in `lossesCount`.
   - Iterate through the `matches` again to filter out players:
     - Those who are not in `lossesCount` (zero losses).
     - Those who have exactly one loss.
   - Sort the lists of players with zero losses and one loss.
   - Return the lists as the result.

### Code

```javascript
var findWinners = function(matches) {
    const winnersSet = new Set();
    const lossesCount = new Map();

    for (let [winner, loser] of matches) {
        winnersSet.add(winner);
        lossesCount.set(loser, (lossesCount.get(loser) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const noLosses = [];
    const oneLoss = [];

    // Collect players with zero losses
    for (let player of winnersSet) {
        if (!lossesCount.has(player)) {
            noLosses.push(player);
        }
    }

    // Collect players with exactly one loss
    for (let [player, count] of lossesCount) {
        if (count === 1) {
            oneLoss.push(player);
        }
    }

    // Sort the results
    noLosses.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    oneLoss.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    return [noLosses, oneLoss];
};

// Example usage:
const matches = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 6], [5, 7], [4, 5], [4, 8], [4, 9], [10, 4]];
console.log(findWinners(matches));
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of data structures:** `O(1)`
- **First Iteration through matches:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of matches.
- **Second Iteration for filtering players:** `O(n)`
- **Sorting:** `O(p log p)` for sorting the players with zero or one loss, where `p` is the number of unique players.
- **Overall time complexity:** `O(n + p log p)`, which should be efficient for typical input sizes.

This solution ensures all player IDs are handled appropriately, and the lists are returned sorted as required.
