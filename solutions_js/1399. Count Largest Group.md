[Leetcode 1399. Count Largest Group](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1399)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. Each number from `1` to `n` is grouped according to the sum of its digits. Return the number of groups that have the largest size.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range and Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? (Typical leetcode constraints might range from 1 to 10^4 or similar.)
   - Is there any indication that `n` could be very large, causing performance concerns?

2. **Sum of Digits Calculation**:
   - Do we need to consider any special cases apart from summing the digits of each number from 1 to `n`?

3. **Input/Output Format**:
   - Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?

### Strategy
1. **Generate Digit Sums**:
   - For each number from `1` to `n`, compute the sum of its digits.
   
2. **Count Group Sizes**:
   - Use a data structure (like a hash map) to count the frequency of each digit sum.

3. **Find the Largest Group**:
   - Determine the maximum value in the frequency map.

4. **Count Largest Groups**:
   - Count how many groups have this maximum frequency.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countLargestGroup = function(n) {
    // Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    const sumOfDigits = (num) => {
        let sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num = Math.floor(num / 10);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    let groupMap = new Map();
    
    // Iterate through numbers 1 to n
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        const sum = sumOfDigits(i);
        groupMap.set(sum, groupMap.get(sum) + 1 || 1);
    }
    
    // Find the maximum group size
    let maxGroupSize = 0;
    for (let count of groupMap.values()) {
        if (count > maxGroupSize) {
            maxGroupSize = count;
        }
    }
    
    // Count how many groups have the maximum size
    let largestCount = 0;
    for (let count of groupMap.values()) {
        if (count === maxGroupSize) {
            largestCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return largestCount;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculating the sum of digits for each number from `1` to `n` involves a logarithmic operation with respect to the number of digits.
   - The total complexity for this step can be approximated as O(k * n), where `k` is the average number of digits in numbers from `1` to `n`.

2. **Hash Map Operations**:
   - Insertion into and access from the map is O(1) on average. Since we perform this for each number from `1` to `n`, this step is O(n).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Iterating over the counts in the frequency map and calculating the maximum and its occurrences is O(d), where `d` is the number of different digit sums (bounded and typically small, e.g., from 0 to 45 for n < 10^4).

Given these observations, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
