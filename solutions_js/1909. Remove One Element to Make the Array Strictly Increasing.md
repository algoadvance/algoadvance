[Leetcode 1909. Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1909)
### Problem Statement
Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, determine whether it is possible to remove exactly one element from the array to make it strictly increasing.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` for every `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

Return `true` if it is possible to remove one element from the array to make it strictly increasing, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What is the possible range of the length of `nums`?
   - **A**: The length of `nums` will be between 1 and 10^5.
   
2. **Q**: What is the range of the values within `nums`?
   - **A**: The values within `nums` will be between -10^6 and 10^6.

3. **Q**: Is it allowed to just keep one element in the array?
   - **A**: No, the array must consist of at least two elements.

### Strategy
1. Traverse the array and find any pair where the condition `nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]` holds. Call this index `i`.
2. If no such index exists, the array is already strictly increasing, and we return `true`.
3. Once an index `i` is found:
   - Check if removing `nums[i]` or `nums[i + 1]` makes the rest of the array strictly increasing.
   - If removing either of these elements results in a strictly increasing array, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

This algorithm ensures that we only make one pass through the array and a few constant-time operations, leading to an efficient solution.

### Code

```javascript
function canBeIncreasing(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let count = 0;
    let index = -1;
    
    // Find the first occurrence where nums[i] >= nums[i+1]
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            index = i;
        }
        if (count > 1) return false; // More than one violation, early exit
    }
    
    // No violations, already strictly increasing
    if (count === 0) return true;
    
    // Check if removing nums[index] or nums[index + 1] helps
    return (
        // Remove nums[index]
        index === 0 || nums[index - 1] < nums[index + 1] ||
        // Remove nums[index + 1]
        index + 1 === n - 1 || nums[index] < nums[index + 2]
    );
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`, because we essentially traverse the array a constant number of times.
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, since we only use a few extra variables and do not require any additional space that scales with the input size.

This solution should efficiently solve the problem for the given constraints.
