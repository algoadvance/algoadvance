[Leetcode 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l108)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - Yes. An empty array should return `null` for the tree.
2. **Are there any duplicates in the array?**
   - No, the array contains only unique integers.
3. **Is the array guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order?**
   - Yes, the array is always sorted in ascending order.

### Strategy:

To create a height-balanced BST from a sorted array, the central element of the array (or sub-array) acts as the root. The left half of the array (or sub-array) will form the left subtree, and the right half will form the right subtree. This ensures the tree remains balanced. 

We will use a recursive approach:
1. Identify the middle element of the current array (or sub-array) segment.
2. Create a tree node with this middle element as the root.
3. Recursively apply the same process to the left sub-array to construct the left subtree and to the right sub-array to construct the right subtree.
4. Return the root node.

### Code:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var sortedArrayToBST = function(nums) {
    // Helper function to construct BST from subarray
    function buildBST(left, right) {
        if (left > right) {
            return null;
        }
        
        // Middle element to maintain balance
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        // Create root node for this segment
        let node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        
        // Recursively construct left and right subtrees
        node.left = buildBST(left, mid - 1);
        node.right = buildBST(mid + 1, right);
        
        return node;
    }
    
    return buildBST(0, nums.length - 1);
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity: O(N)** - Each element of the array is visited once to build the tree nodes.
- **Space Complexity: O(log N)** - The space required for the recursion stack, which will be proportional to the height of the tree. Given the tree is balanced, the height will be `log N`.

This approach ensures the BST remains height-balanced and efficiently constructs the tree in linear time relative to the size of the input array.
