[Leetcode 1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1497)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. Find out whether there are pairs of elements in the array such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the array?**
   - There is no explicit limit mentioned, but it can be assumed to be reasonably large (i.e., within usual problem constraints, like up to 10^5 elements).

2. **Can the elements be negative?**
   - Yes, the problem does not restrict the elements from being positive or negative.

3. **Are all elements integers?**
   - Yes, all elements in the array are integers.

4. **What should we return?**
   - Return `true` if the array can be paired such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`, otherwise return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Remainders:**
   - For each element in `arr`, calculate the remainder when divided by `k` (`arr[i] % k`). 

2. **Count Frequency of Remainders:**
   - Use a counter (hash map) to count the frequency of each remainder.

3. **Check Pair Conditions:**
   - For every remainder `r`:
     - If `r == 0`, the count of `r` must be even because `0 + 0` is the only way to get a sum that is divisible by `k`.
     - For remainder pairs `(r, k-r)`, their counts must be equal to form pairs.

4. **Iterate through Frequencies:**
   - Iterate through the remainder frequencies and check the above conditions for all remainders.

### Code

```javascript
function canArrange(arr, k) {
    const remainderCount = new Array(k).fill(0);

    // Count frequencies of remainders
    for (let num of arr) {
        const remainder = ((num % k) + k) % k;
        remainderCount[remainder]++;
    }

    // Check pairs to ensure divisibility by k
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (i === 0) {
            // Special case for remainder 0, it needs an even count
            if (remainderCount[i] % 2 !== 0) {
                return false;
            }
        } else if (remainderCount[i] !== remainderCount[k - i]) {
            // Remainder i and k-i must be pairable
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Remainder Calculation:** O(n) — We iterate through each element of the array once.
- **Checking Remainders:** O(k) — We check pairs of remainders, and in the worst case, we check up to `k` remainders.

**Overall:** O(n + k), where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the divisor.

This solution is efficient and reasonable given typical constraints.
