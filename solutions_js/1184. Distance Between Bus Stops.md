[Leetcode 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1184)
## Problem Statement

A bus has `n` stops, numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in the direction the bus travels. We have a `distance` array where `distance[i]` describes the distance between the `i`-th stop and the `(i + 1)`-th stop (where `i + 1` is taken modulo `n` to wrap around). Given two stops, `start` and `destination`, you need to compute the shortest distance between them. The distance can be calculated both forward (from start to destination) and backward (from destination to start) along the circular route. Return the shortest distance.

### Example:
```
Input: distance = [1, 2, 3, 4], start = 0, destination = 3
Output: 4
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `distance.length == n`
- `0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= start, destination < n`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that `start` and `destination` are different? 
   - Yes.
2. Can we assume `distance` is always non-negative?
   - Yes, as per constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Direct Distance**: Compute the distance going forward from `start` to `destination`.
2. **Calculate Reverse Distance**: Compute the distance going the opposite direction.
3. **Return the Minimum Distance**: The shortest path will be the minimum of the distances calculated in steps 1 and 2.

## Code

```javascript
function distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination) {
    if (start > destination) {
        [start, destination] = [destination, start];
    }

    let forwardDistance = 0;
    for (let i = start; i < destination; i++) {
        forwardDistance += distance[i];
    }

    let backwardDistance = 0;
    for (let i = destination; i != start; i = (i + 1) % distance.length) {
        backwardDistance += distance[i];
    }

    return Math.min(forwardDistance, backwardDistance);
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Input Adjustment**:
   - If `start` is greater than `destination`, swap them to simplify the calculation.

2. **Forward Distance Calculation**:
   - Iterate from `start` to `destination - 1` and sum up the distances for the forward path.

3. **Backward Distance Calculation**:
   - Iterate from `destination` to `start` considering the circular nature of the array using modulo operations to loop correctly. 

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the smaller of the two distances.

## Time Complexity

- **Time**: O(n)
    - We iterate through the `distance` array elements up to two times - once for calculating the forward distance and once for the backward distance.
- **Space**: O(1)
    - We use a constant amount of additional space for a few variables.

The function efficiently calculates the shortest distance in a circular route with a complexity of \(O(n)\), well-suited for the problem constraints.
