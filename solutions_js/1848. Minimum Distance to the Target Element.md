[Leetcode 1848. Minimum Distance to the Target Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1848)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` (0-indexed) and two integers `target` and `start`. The array `nums` is such that `target` exists in `nums`.

Moreover, there is at least one occurrence of `target` in `nums`.

You want to find the minimum distance between `start` and any position `i` such that `nums[i] == target`.

The distance between two indices `i` and `j` is `|i - j|` (the absolute value of the difference between the indices).

Return the minimum distance between `start` and any position `i` such that `nums[i] == target`.

### Example
```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 5, start = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: nums[4] == 5 and abs(4 - 3) = 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], target = 1, start = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: nums[0] == 1 and abs(0 - 0) = 0

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], target = 1, start = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Every index contains 1. The absolute difference between start and any index is 0.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= start < nums.length`
- `target` is guaranteed to be in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain duplicate elements? 
   - **Yes**, the array can contain duplicate elements.
2. What should be returned if `target` is found at `start`?
   - You should return `0` since the distance from `start` to itself is `0`.
3. Is the target always present in `nums`?
   - **Yes**, it is guaranteed that the target is present in the array.

---

## Strategy
1. Initialize a variable to hold the minimum distance (`minDistance`) to `Infinity`.
2. Iterate through all indices of the array `nums`.
3. For every index `i` where `nums[i] == target`:
   - Calculate the distance from `i` to `start`.
   - If this distance is smaller than the current `minDistance`, update `minDistance`.
4. After the loop completes, return the `minDistance`.

This strategy ensures that we check all occurrences of the `target` and find the closest one to `start`.

---

## Code

Here is the Javascript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function getMinDistance(nums, target, start) {
    let minDistance = Infinity; // To hold our minimum distance

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === target) {
            const currentDistance = Math.abs(i - start);
            if (currentDistance < minDistance) {
                minDistance = currentDistance;
            }
        }
    }

    return minDistance;
}
```

### Explanation:
- `minDistance` is initialized to a very large number (`Infinity`) to ensure any real distance will be smaller.
- We loop through each index `i` in `nums`.
- If the value at index `i` is equal to `target`, we calculate the absolute distance between `i` and `start`.
- If this distance is less than our current `minDistance`, we update `minDistance`.
- After the loop is done, `minDistance` contains the smallest distance and is returned.

---

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums`.
- We traverse the list exactly once.

Given the constraints (`1 <= nums.length <= 1000`), this approach will be efficient and perform well within limits.
