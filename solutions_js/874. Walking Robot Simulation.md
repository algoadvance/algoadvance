[Leetcode 874. Walking Robot Simulation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l874)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of commands and an array of obstacles. The commands are integers where `-2` and `-1` represent turning left and right by 90 degrees respectively, and positive integers represent moving forward by that number of steps in the current direction. The robot starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and initially faces north.

The robot navigates an infinite grid, but it cannot walk into obstacles. Each obstacle is represented as a pair of coordinates `[x, y]`.

You need to determine the maximum Euclidean distance squared (i.e., `x^2 + y^2`) from the origin that the robot reaches at any point during the simulation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Dimensions of Grid**: The grid is infinite, correct?
    - Yes, the grid is infinite.
2. **Obstacles Placement**: Can obstacles overlap or be placed on the starting point (0, 0)?
    - Obstacles cannot overlap, but they can be placed anywhere in the grid except the starting point.

### Code

```javascript
function robotSim(commands, obstacles) {
    // Initialize the direction vectors
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]; // north, east, south, west
    let d = 0; // Starting direction (north)

    // Convert obstacles to a set of strings for constant-time lookup
    const obstacleSet = new Set(obstacles.map(([x, y]) => `${x},${y}`));
    
    // Initialize starting position
    let x = 0, y = 0;

    // Variable to keep track of the maximum distance squared
    let maxDistanceSq = 0;

    for (let command of commands) {
        if (command === -2) {
            // Turn left
            d = (d + 3) % 4;  // equivalent to (d - 1) % 4 but avoids negative index
        } else if (command === -1) {
            // Turn right
            d = (d + 1) % 4;
        } else {
            // Move forward `command` steps
            for (let i = 0; i < command; i++) {
                const nextX = x + directions[d][0];
                const nextY = y + directions[d][1];

                if (obstacleSet.has(`${nextX},${nextY}`)) {
                    // Hit an obstacle, stop further movement in this direction
                    break;
                }

                // Move to the next position
                x = nextX;
                y = nextY;

                // Update the maximum distance squared
                maxDistanceSq = Math.max(maxDistanceSq, x * x + y * y);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxDistanceSq;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Direction Handling**: Use a `directions` array to represent the change in coordinates for north, east, south, and west directions. Use a variable `d` to keep track of the current direction.
2. **Obstacle Management**: Convert the obstacles array into a `Set` of strings for O(1) look-up times.
3. **Simulation**:
    - Iterate over each command.
    - If the command is `-2` turn left, update the direction counter-clockwise.
    - If the command is `-1`, turn right, update the direction clockwise.
    - If the command is a positive integer, move step by step, checking for obstacles.
4. **Distance Calculation**: After each move, calculate the squared distance and update the maximum distance found so far.

### Time Complexity

- Converting obstacles to a set takes O(k) where k is the number of obstacles.
- The simulation of commands takes O(n * m) where n is the number of commands and m is the average number of steps (this is because worst case you could be moving up to `m` steps all without hitting an obstacle).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * m + k). This ensures that the robot simulation efficiently handles the movement and obstacle detection.
