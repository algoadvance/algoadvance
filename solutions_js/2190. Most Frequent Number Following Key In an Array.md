[Leetcode 2190. Most Frequent Number Following Key In an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2190)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `key`, which occurs at least once in `nums`. Your task is to identify the most frequent integer that follows `key` in the array. In other words, find the integer that appears most frequently immediately after any occurrence of `key` in `nums`.

Return the most frequent integer that follows `key` in the array. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest one.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [1, 100, 200, 1, 100]`, `key = 1`
- Output: `100`
  
**Note:**
- `1` appears at indices 0 and 3 in the array, so check the elements that appear right after them, which are `100` and `100`.
- Since `100` appears more frequently, the output is `100`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Is the array guaranteed to have at least one element after every key occurrence?
   **A**: No, some key occurrences might be the last element.
2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums` or the values it contains?
   **A**: You can assume `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize a map** to store the frequency of occurrences of elements that immediately follow the key.
2. **Traverse the nums array**, for each element that is equal to the key:
   - Check if it has a successor.
   - If it does, record the successor's frequency in the map.
3. **Determine the most frequent successor** by iterating through the map.
4. **Return the smallest element** if there is a tie in frequency.

## Code

Here is the JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
function mostFrequent(nums, key) {
    const frequencyMap = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === key) {
            const follower = nums[i + 1];
            if (frequencyMap.has(follower)) {
                frequencyMap.set(follower, frequencyMap.get(follower) + 1);
            } else {
                frequencyMap.set(follower, 1);
            }
        }
    }

    let mostFrequentNum = null;
    let maxFrequency = -1;

    frequencyMap.forEach((value, key) => {
        if (value > maxFrequency || (value === maxFrequency && key < mostFrequentNum)) {
            mostFrequentNum = key;
            maxFrequency = value;
        }
    });

    return mostFrequentNum;
}

// Example usage
console.log(mostFrequent([1, 100, 200, 1, 100], 1));  // Output: 100
console.log(mostFrequent([2, 2, 2, 2, 3], 2));  // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we need to scan through the array once to build the frequency map, and the map operations (insert, update) are constant time on average.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case, where the frequency map might store up to `n` unique elements.

This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.
