[Leetcode 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l953)
## Problem Statement

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language and the order of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

```plaintext
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then the sequence is not sorted.
```

```plaintext
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.)
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the characters in the order string guaranteed to be unique?**
   - *Yes, each character will definitely appear once in the order string.*
   
2. **Are any words in the words array guaranteed to be empty?**
   - *No, each word is guaranteed to have at least one character.*

3. **In case of equal prefixes, should shorter words come before longer words?**
   - *Yes, as seen in the third example, ["apple", "app"] should return false.*

## Strategy

1. **Create a Character Position Map**: Create a map that associates each character with its position in the given order string.
2. **Compare Words Lexicographically**: For each adjacent pair of words, compare character by character according to the alien order.
3. **Early Termination**: If at any position, characters differ and the first word's character ranks higher according to the alien dictionary, return false.
4. **Check Prefix Case**: If one word is a prefix of another, ensure the longer word comes after the shorter one.
5. **Return True If All Checks Pass**: If none of the checks return false, return true at the end.

## Code

```javascript
function isAlienSorted(words, order) {
    // Create a map for character positions
    const charPosition = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
        charPosition[order[i]] = i;
    }

    // Function to compare two words based on the alien dictionary
    const compareWords = (word1, word2) => {
        const len = Math.min(word1.length, word2.length);
        for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (word1[i] !== word2[i]) {
                return charPosition[word1[i]] - charPosition[word2[i]];
            }
        }
        return word1.length - word2.length; // If all chars are the same, shorter word should come first
    };

    // Checking the order of each word with the next one
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
        if (compareWords(words[i], words[i + 1]) > 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Character Mapping**: The creation of the character position map involves iterating over the length of the order string, which is \(O(26) = O(1)\).
  
2. **Comparison Loop**: We compare each adjacent word pair, and in the worst case, each comparison involves checking each character of a word. Given that each word's maximum length is 20 and there are at most 100 words, the total time complexity for comparisons is \(O(N \cdot M)\) where \(N\) is the number of words and \(M\) is the maximum length of a word.

3. **Overall Time Complexity**: Hence, overall, the time complexity is \(O(N \cdot M)\).
