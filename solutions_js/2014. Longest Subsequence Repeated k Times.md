[Leetcode 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2014)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the longest subsequence of `s` that is repeated `k` times. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of string `s`?
    - Are there specific character types in `s` (e.g., only lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits)?
  
2. **Output Constraints:**
    - If there are multiple longest subsequences, is it sufficient to return any one of them?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What if `k` is greater than the length of `s`? Should we return an empty string in that case?
    - What if `s` is an empty string? 

### Code
Here is a proposed solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
var longestSubsequenceRepeatedK = function(s, k) {
    function isSubsequence(s, sub) {
        let i = 0;
        for (let char of s) {
            if (char === sub[i]) i++;
            if (i === sub.length) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    let count = new Map();
    for (let char of s) {
        count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    let candidates = [];
    for (let [char, freq] of count.entries()) {
        if (freq >= k) candidates.push(char);
    }
    
    candidates.sort();
    let res = '';
    
    function dfs(path) {
        if (path.length > res.length) {
            if (isValid(path)) res = path;
        }
        
        for (let char of candidates) {
            dfs(path + char);
        }
    }
    
    function isValid(sub) {
        let tmp = '';
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) tmp += sub;
        return isSubsequence(s, tmp);
    }
    
    dfs('');
    
    return res;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(longestSubsequenceRepeatedK("banana", 2)); // Output could be "ana" or "ban"
```

### Strategy
1. **Frequencies and Candidates:** First, count the frequency of each character in the string `s`. If a character appears at least `k` times, it becomes a candidate for the subsequence.
   
2. **Subsequence Validation:** We need a helper function `isSubsequence` to check if a given string can be a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Backtracking:** Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible subsequences that can be formed by the candidate characters. For each candidate subsequence, verify if it can be repeated `k` times and still be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Result Tracking:** Track the longest valid subsequence encountered.

### Time Complexity
- **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where n is the length of `s`, for creating the frequency map.
- **DFS:** The number of potential subsequences is combinatorial, potentially leading to O(2^c), where c is the number of candidate characters.
- **Validation:** Each validation could take O(n). Combining this with the combinatorial search, the solution could be exponentially complex in the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion
This solution uses depth-first search combined with a pruning strategy based on character frequency, enabling it to probe efficiently for the longest valid subsequence. Potential optimizations could include more sophisticated pruning methods to reduce the search space further.
