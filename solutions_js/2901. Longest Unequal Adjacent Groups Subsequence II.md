[Leetcode 2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2901)
## Problem Statement

You're given a string `s` of lowercase English letters. Find the length of the longest subsequence such that no two adjacent characters in the subsequence appear more than once consecutively in the original string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string `s`?
   - Assume `s` contains at least one character and up to \(10^5\) characters.
2. Can the subsequence include repeating characters as long as they do not appear more than once consecutively in the original string?
   - Yes, as long as they don't appear more than once consecutively in the original string.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the string and build the longest subsequence according to the given rules. A dynamic programming approach where we track the maximum length of valid subsequences ending at each index of the string might be practical. However, for efficiency, we may employ a greedy approach to directly construct the valid subsequence.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty result string to build our subsequence.
2. Use a set to keep track of characters added to the result that were last added within a specific window to ensure no two adjacent characters appear consecutively more than allowed.
3. Traverse the string `s`, and for each character, check if it is eligible to be added to the result.
4. If eligible, append it to our result subsequence and update our tracking set accordingly.
5. Finally, return the length of the resultant subsequence.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string since we are processing each character of the string once.

## Code

```javascript
function longestUnequalAdjacentSubsequence(s) {
    let result = [];
    let lastSeen = new Map(); // To record the last index where each character was seen
    let resultLen = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        const lastIndex = lastSeen.get(char);

        if (resultLen === 0 || lastIndex === undefined || i - lastIndex > 1) {
            result.push(char);
            resultLen++;
            lastSeen.set(char, i);
        }
    }

    return resultLen;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "abbaac";
console.log(longestUnequalAdjacentSubsequence(s)); // Output: 4, because "abac" is a valid subsequence.
```

This solution ensures that we build the longest subsequence dynamically while respecting the constraints. The `lastSeen` map helps in checking if the conditions are violated efficiently.

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty `result` array to store the subsequence, a `lastSeen` map to track the last index each character was used, and `resultLen` to track the current length of the result.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through each character in the string `s`.
3. **Check Eligibility**: For each character, ensure that it either hasn't been used yet or its last usage is not adjacent.
4. **Update**: If the character is eligible, append it to `result`, increment the length, and update its last seen index.
5. **Result**: At the end of the loop, the length of `result` is the length of the longest valid subsequence.
