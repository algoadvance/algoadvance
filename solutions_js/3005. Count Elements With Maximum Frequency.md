[Leetcode 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3005)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` representing the data, write a function to return the number of elements with the maximum frequency. In other words, you need to find the element that appears most frequently in the array and return the count of such elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of numbers in the array**: Can the elements of the `nums` array be negative, and what is the range of possible values within the array?
2. **Array length**: Is there a constraint on the length of `nums`?
3. **Multiple Maximum Frequencies**: If there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency, do we count all such elements as part of the result?

Assuming:
1. The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
2. There is no specific length constraint for `nums`.
3. We are counting the number of unique elements that appear with the highest frequency.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Use a hash map (JavaScript object) to count the frequency of each element in the array.
    
2. **Identify Maximum Frequency**:
    - Traverse the frequency map to identify the highest frequency.
    
3. **Count Elements with Maximum Frequency**:
    - Traverse the frequency map again to count how many elements have this maximum frequency.

### Code

```javascript
function countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums) {
    const frequencyMap = {};
    
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (frequencyMap[num] === undefined) {
            frequencyMap[num] = 1;
        } else {
            frequencyMap[num]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Identify the maximum frequency
    let maxFrequency = 0;
    for (let key in frequencyMap) {
        if (frequencyMap[key] > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = frequencyMap[key];
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Count elements with the maximum frequency
    let count = 0;
    for (let key in frequencyMap) {
        if (frequencyMap[key] === maxFrequency) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(countElementsWithMaxFrequency([1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3])); // Should output 1
console.log(countElementsWithMaxFrequency([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]));   // Should output 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Finding Maximum Frequency**: O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements.
- **Counting Elements with Maximum Frequency**: O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements.

Overall time complexity: **O(n + m)**.

Given that in the worst case, `m` could be `n` (if all elements are unique), the overall time complexity can be considered **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

- The space needed for the frequency map is O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements.

In conclusion, the space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case.
