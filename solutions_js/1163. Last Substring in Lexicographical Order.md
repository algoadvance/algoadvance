[Leetcode 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1163)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. You need to find the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - It can have a length of up to 500,000 characters.

2. **What characters does the string `s` contain?**
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Is there any constraint on extra space usage?**
   - No specific constraint provided, but a solution should ideally operate in linear or near-linear space complexity relative to the input size.

### Strategy

To find the last substring in lexicographical order, a naive approach would be to generate all substrings and then find the maximum. However, this is computationally infeasible for large strings due to the high number of substrings.

Instead, we can use a more efficient approach:
1. **Two-pointer technique:** 
   - Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to compare potential substrings starting from different indices.
   - Move the pointer that starts from a lexicographically smaller substring until we identify the start of the largest substring.

2. **Complexity considerations:**
   - The approach should ideally traverse the string linearly making it `O(n)` in time complexity where `n` is the length of the string.

### Code

```javascript
function lastSubstring(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let i = 0; // Initial pointer.
    let j = 1; // Compare pointer.
    let k = 0; // Offset for comparison.

    while (j + k < n) {
        if (s[i + k] === s[j + k]) {
            // Advance the offset if characters are same.
            k++;
        } else if (s[i + k] < s[j + k]) {
            // Change the starting point `i` if the substring starting at `i` is smaller.
            i = Math.max(i + k + 1, j);
            j = i + 1;
            k = 0;
        } else {
            // Change the starting point `j` if the substring starting at `j` is smaller.
            j = j + k + 1;
            k = 0;
        }
    }

    return s.slice(i);
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(lastSubstring("abab")); // Output: "bab"
console.log(lastSubstring("leetcode")); // Output: "tcode"
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j`, with `i` starting at the beginning of the string and `j` starting at the next character.
2. Compare characters at the current offset `k` starting from both `i` and `j`.
3. If characters are the same, increment `k` and continue the comparison.
4. If the character at `i + k` is less than the character at `j + k`, move `i` forward to `i + k + 1` and reset `j` to `i + 1`.
5. If the character at `i + k` is greater, move `j` forward and reset the offset `k`.
6. Continue this process until `j + k` reaches the end of the string.
7. Return the substring starting from index `i`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm traverses the string only once with a few extra operations making it `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using constant extra space beyond the input string.
