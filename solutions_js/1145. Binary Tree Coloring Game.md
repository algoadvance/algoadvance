[Leetcode 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1145)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes where each node is uniquely numbered from `1` to `n`. Two players play a game starting at the root of the tree. The first player colors a node `x` (with the player's chosen color), and the second player colors any node with their own color (let's call it node `y`). Then, the first player gets to move and can cut the tree anywhere (removing edges). The player who controls the most nodes after the cut wins.

Return `true` if the second player can guarantee a win, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value of n?**
   - This isn't explicitly provided, but we can assume that it fits within typical constraints for a binary tree problem (e.g., up to 10^4 nodes).

2. **Can we assume that the input tree is always valid?**
   - Yes, we can assume the given Binary Tree is valid and well-formed.

3. **What information is provided as input?**
   - The root of the binary tree and the integer `x` indicating the node colored by the first player.

With these details in mind, let's move on to the solution strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Subtrees**:
   - When the first player colors a node `x`, it naturally divides the subtree into three potential subtrees:
     - The left subtree of `x`.
     - The right subtree of `x`.
     - The rest of the tree excluding the subtree rooted at `x`.

2. **Count Nodes in Subtrees**:
   - We must count how many nodes are in each of these three parts. 
   - To do this, we can use a recursive function that will traverse the tree and determine the size of the left and right subtrees of node `x`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Nodes**:
   - The remaining nodes are those nodes not in the subtree rooted at `x`. This value can be calculated as `n - leftSubtreeCount - rightSubtreeCount - 1`.

4. **Determine Winning Strategy**:
   - The second player can choose the largest part among the three to ensure they have the majority of the nodes.
   - The second player wins if the largest of the three parts has more than half of the total nodes `n`.

Let's translate this strategy into code.

### Code

```javascript
function btreeGameWinningMove(root, n, x) {
    let leftCount = 0, rightCount = 0;

    function countNodes(node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        let left = countNodes(node.left);
        let right = countNodes(node.right);

        if (node.val === x) {
            leftCount = left;
            rightCount = right;
        }

        return left + right + 1;
    }

    countNodes(root);

    let parentCount = n - (leftCount + rightCount + 1);
    let maxPart = Math.max(leftCount, rightCount, parentCount);

    return maxPart > n / 2;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` because in the worst case, we need to traverse all `n` nodes of the tree to count the nodes in each subtree.

### Explanation

1. **countNodes function**:
   - This helper function recursively counts the nodes in each subtree.
   - While counting, it finds the node `x` and records the sizes of its left and right subtrees.

2. **Calculate the sizes**:
   - After the traversal, `leftCount` and `rightCount` store the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the node `x`.
   - `parentCount` is calculated by subtracting the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at `x` from `n`.

3. **Determine if the second player can win**:
   - The second player wins if the largest of the three segments has more than half of the nodes.

This solution efficiently identifies whether the second player can guarantee a win by analyzing the sizes of the three potential segments created by the node `x`.
