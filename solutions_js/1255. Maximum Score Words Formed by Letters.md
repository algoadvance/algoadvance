[Leetcode 1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1255)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and an array of characters `chars`. A string `words[i]` can be formed by the characters in `chars` if the frequency of each character in `words[i]` is less than or equal to the frequency of that character in `chars`. Return the maximum score of valid words that can be formed by using the given characters.

The score of a single word is defined as the sum of its characters' values: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`,..., `z = 26`. If a word cannot be formed, its score is considered to be 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the character values of the letters guaranteed to be lowercase English letters only?**
   - Yes, all characters will be lowercase English letters.

2. **Can `words` and `chars` contain repeated characters?**
   - Yes, both can contain repeated characters.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the input lists are not empty?**
   - Yes, assume that `words` and `chars` are not empty.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate the Frequency of Characters in `chars`:**
   - Create a frequency dictionary for the characters in `chars`. This will help us quickly check if a word can be formed with the available characters.

2. **Iterate Through Each Word in `words`:**
   - For each word, calculate the frequency of its characters.
   - Check against the `chars` frequency dictionary to see if the word can be formed.
   - If the word can be formed, calculate its score and keep track of the maximum score found.

3. **Score Calculation of Each Word:**
   - Sum up the values of its characters (where `a = 1`, `b = 2`, etc.).

### Code

```javascript
function maxScoreWords(words, letters, score) {
    // Helper function to calculate character frequency
    const getFrequency = (str) => {
        const freq = {};
        for (const char of str) {
            freq[char] = (freq[char] || 0) + 1;
        }
        return freq;
    };

    // Calculate character frequencies in letters
    const lettersFreq = getFrequency(letters);

    // Calculate score of a word based on given score array
    const calculateWordScore = (word) => {
        let wordScore = 0;
        for (const char of word) {
            wordScore += score[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
        }
        return wordScore;
    };

    let maxScore = 0;

    // Check each word
    for (const word of words) {
        const wordFreq = getFrequency(word);
        let canForm = true;

        // Check if word can be formed with the given letters
        for (const char in wordFreq) {
            if (wordFreq[char] > (lettersFreq[char] || 0)) {
                canForm = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (canForm) {
            const wordScore = calculateWordScore(word);
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, wordScore);
        }
    }

    return maxScore;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Frequency Calculation:** `O(L)` for `letters` and each word in `words`, where `L` is the length of `letters` and the length of each individual word. If `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of words, it would take `O(n * m)` in total for all words.
2. **Checking Word Formation:** For each word, `_O(m)`_ where `m` is the length of the word, and there are `n` words, leading to `O(n * m)` in total.
3. **Scoring Calculation:** Similarly, `O(m)` per word, leading to `O(n * m)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of words.
