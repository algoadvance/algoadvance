[Leetcode 2845. Count of Interesting Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2845)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `mod` and `k`. An array is called interesting if it contains at least `k` elements that are divisible by `mod`.

Return the number of interesting subarrays.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for `nums`, `mod`, and `k`?**
   - The elements in `nums` could be very large or small, and `mod` and `k` are within reasonable range.
2. **Do all subarrays need to be contiguous?**
   - Yes, subarrays need to be contiguous segments of the original array.

## Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum & Modular Arithmetic**:
   - We will use prefix sum and modular arithmetic to efficiently count the number of interesting subarrays. By leveraging prefix sums, we can keep track of counts of elements in specific remainder classes modulo `mod`.
2. **Remainder Tracking**:
   - Keep track of remainders of the counts of elements divisible by `mod` seen so far.
   - If we find the same remainder at different indices, it indicates that the number of elements divisible by `mod` within that range can contribute to the count of interesting subarrays.
3. **Iterate and Compute**:
   - Iterate through the array while maintaining a running count of elements divisible by `mod`.
   - Use a hashmap to track the counts of these running totals modulo `mod`.

## Code

Here is the code that implements the strategy described above:

```javascript
function countInterestingSubarrays(nums, mod, k) {
    let prefixRemaindersCount = new Map();
    prefixRemaindersCount.set(0, 1); 
    let countDivByMod = 0;
    let result = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num % mod === 0) {
            countDivByMod++;
        }
        const remainder = countDivByMod % mod;
        const targetRemainder = (remainder - k + mod) % mod;

        if (prefixRemaindersCount.has(targetRemainder)) {
            result += prefixRemaindersCount.get(targetRemainder);
        }

        prefixRemaindersCount.set(remainder, (prefixRemaindersCount.get(remainder) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countInterestingSubarrays([3, 6, 9, 12, 15], 3, 2)); // Output example
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we only iterate through the array once and use a hashmap for constant-time insertions and queries.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(mod)`, since in the worst case, we may store up to `mod` different remainders in the hashmap.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently count the number of interesting subarrays in linear time.
