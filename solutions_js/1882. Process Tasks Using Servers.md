[Leetcode 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1882)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. Servers[i] is the weight of the ith server, and tasks[j] is the time needed to process the jth task in seconds.

Tasks are assigned to servers using the following rules:
1. The ith task is assigned to the server with the smallest weight that is free at the time it starts processing. If multiple servers have the same weight, the task should be assigned to the server with the smallest index.
2. If there is no free server, the task waits until a server becomes available and is assigned at the earliest time possible, following the previous two rules.

Return an array of length `m` where `ans[j]` is the index of the server the jth task is assigned to.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of weights and task times?**
   - `1 <= servers.length <= 1000`
   - `1 <= tasks.length <= 1000`
   - `1 <= servers[i], tasks[j] <= 2 * 10^5`

2. **Is the order of tasks in the input array `tasks` the order in which they arrive?**
   - Yes, the tasks must be processed in the given order.

3. **Can the lengths of the `servers` and `tasks` arrays differ?**
   - Yes, `servers` and `tasks` can have different lengths.

### Strategy

1. **Use Priority Queues (Heaps):** 
   - Maintain two heaps:
     - `freeServers` to manage the free servers using a min-heap ordered by `(weight, index)`.
     - `busyServers` to manage the servers that are currently busy using a min-heap ordered by the time the server will become free.
  
2. **Task Processing:**
   - Iterate over the tasks in order.
   - For each task, release all servers that have become free by the current time.
   - Assign the current task to the server with the smallest weight (or smallest index if there's a tie).
   - If no servers are free, wait until the next server becomes available and then assign the task.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - Push servers to `freeServers` when they are released.
   - Pop the appropriate server from `freeServers` for task assignment.

### Code

```javascript
function assignTasks(servers, tasks) {
    const freeServers = new MinPriorityQueue({
        priority: server => server[0] * 1000 + server[1]
    });
    
    const busyServers = new MinPriorityQueue({
        priority: server => server[2]
    });

    const result = [];
    const n = servers.length;
    
    // Initialize free servers priority queue
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        freeServers.enqueue([servers[i], i, 0]); // [weight, index, free time]
    }

    let currentTime = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < tasks.length; j++) {
        currentTime = Math.max(currentTime, j);
        
        // Release servers that are done by the current time
        while (!busyServers.isEmpty() && busyServers.front().element[2] <= currentTime) {
            const server = busyServers.dequeue().element;
            freeServers.enqueue([server[0], server[1], 0]);
        }
        
        if (freeServers.isEmpty()) {
            const nextAvailable = busyServers.dequeue().element;
            currentTime = nextAvailable[2];
            freeServers.enqueue([nextAvailable[0], nextAvailable[1], 0]);
        }

        const serverToUse = freeServers.dequeue().element;
        result.push(serverToUse[1]);
        
        // Schedule the task
        busyServers.enqueue([serverToUse[0], serverToUse[1], currentTime + tasks[j]]);
    }
    
    return result;
}

class MinPriorityQueue {
    constructor(options) {
        this.queue = [];
        this.priority = options.priority;
    }
    
    enqueue(element) {
        this.queue.push(element);
        this.queue.sort((a, b) => this.priority(a) - this.priority(b));
    }
    
    dequeue() {
        return this.queue.shift();
    }
    
    front() {
        return this.queue[0];
    }
    
    isEmpty() {
        return this.queue.length === 0;
    }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(assignTasks([3,3,2], [1,2,3,2,1,2])); // Output might be [2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting and Priority Queue operations dominate the time complexity.
- **Initialization:** O(n log n) to initially push all servers into the `freeServers` heap.
- **Task Assignment and Server Release:** Each task involves heap operations that take O(log n), and since there are `m` tasks, it will be O(m log n) for this part.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O((n + m) log n)**.
