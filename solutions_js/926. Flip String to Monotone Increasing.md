[Leetcode 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l926)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary string `s`, return the minimum number of flips required to make `s` monotone increasing.

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`s (also possibly none).

### Example:
- Input: `s = "00110"`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.

- Input: `s = "010110"`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: We flip to get `011110`, or `001111`.

- Input: `s = "00011000"`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: We flip to get `00000000` or `00011111`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - No, the input string will have at least one character.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The string length will be at most 300,000.

## Strategy
1. The problem involves dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum flips needed.
2. We can traverse the string while keeping track of two running counts:
   - `countFlip0To1`: Minimum flips required to make the substring ending at the current position monotone increasing ending with `1`.
   - `countFlip1To0`: Minimum flips required to make the substring ending at the current position monotone increasing ending with `0`.
3. At the i-th character of the string:
   - If `s[i]` is `0`, then `countFlip1To0` remains the same because there are no flips needed for zero-ending substrings, but `countFlip0To1` needs to increase by one if it was previously treated as `1` to accommodate this zero.
   - If `s[i]` is `1`, then `countFlip0To1` can just continue as it is, but `countFlip1To0` must be incremented by one if it were made to flip a zero to one.
4. Finally, the minimum of `countFlip0To1` and `countFlip1To0` will give us the answer.

## Code
```javascript
var minFlipsMonoIncr = function(s) {
    let countFlip0To1 = 0; // flips to make the current substring end with 0
    let countFlip1To0 = 0; // flips to make the current substring end with 1

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '0') {
            // If the current character is '0':
            // Flip `1` to `0` case remains same,
            // But to end with `1`, we need to flip this `0` to '1'
            countFlip0To1 = Math.min(countFlip0To1, countFlip1To0);
            countFlip1To0 += 1;
        } else {
            // If the current character is '1':
            // Flip `1` to `0` case will need another flip,
            // But to end with `0`, we stay the same as previously flipped 0s
            countFlip1To0 = Math.min(countFlip0To1, countFlip1To0);
            countFlip0To1 += 1;
        }
    }

    // The minimum flips required to make the whole string monotone increasing
    return Math.min(countFlip0To1, countFlip1To0);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minFlipsMonoIncr("00110")); // Output: 1
console.log(minFlipsMonoIncr("010110")); // Output: 2
console.log(minFlipsMonoIncr("00011000")); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, because it processes each character exactly once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few variables for counting the flips.
