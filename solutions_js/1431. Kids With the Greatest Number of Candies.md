[Leetcode 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1431)
## Problem Statement

Given the array `candies` and the integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the `i-th` kid has. For each kid, check if there is a way to distribute `extraCandies` among the kids such that the `i-th` kid can have the greatest number of candies among them. Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving `extraCandies` to the `i-th` kid, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the expected input range for the number of kids and candies?
   - The length of the `candies` array can be up to 100, and each element in `candies` can be up to 100.

2. What should be done if `extraCandies` is negative?
   - According to the problem statement, `extraCandies` will always be a non-negative integer.

3. Should we consider only positive integers in `candies`?
   - Yes, based on typical problem constraints, `candies` array will contain non-negative integers only.

## Strategy

1. First, determine the greatest number of candies any kid currently has.
2. Iterate over each kid's candies count and compute if giving them `extraCandies` results in an amount greater than or equal to the maximum candies currently any kid has.
3. Store the result in a boolean array that indicates whether each kid can potentially have the greatest number of candies.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} candies
 * @param {number} extraCandies
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
var kidsWithCandies = function(candies, extraCandies) {
    const maxCandies = Math.max(...candies); // Find the maximum candies any kid currently has
    return candies.map(candy => candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies); // Check and return results
};

// Example usage:
const candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3];
const extraCandies = 3;
console.log(kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies)); // Output: [true, true, true, false, true]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the maximum**: O(n), where `n` is the number of kids because we need to iterate through the array to find the max value.
- **Mapping the array**: O(n), as we check each candy count with the extra candies.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and provides the desired results correctly.
