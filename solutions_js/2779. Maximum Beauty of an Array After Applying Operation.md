[Leetcode 2779. Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2779)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, you are allowed to perform an operation where you can add or subtract 1 from any element of `nums`. You can perform this operation as many times as you want on any element. However, you can perform this operation at most once on each element of the array. Your task is to find the maximum beauty of the array.

The beauty of an array is defined as the maximum length of a subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum values in that subarray is at most 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on operations:** Is it only possible to add or subtract 1 from each element, or can any integer addition/subtraction be applied?
   - *Answer:* You can only add or subtract 1 from any element.
  
2. **Subarray definition:** Should the subarray be contiguous?
   - *Answer:* Yes, the subarray must be contiguous.

3. **Array properties:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the value of the elements?
   - *Answer:* Typical constraints should apply such as reasonable length and values fitting within expected integer ranges.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array:** Given the definition of beauty, we need to consider modifying each element by -1, 0, or +1.
2. **Track maximum beauty continuously:** As we modify elements, we need to compute the length of the maximum subarray where the difference between maximum and minimum is at most 1.
3. **Sliding window approach:** A sliding window will help in efficiently considering subarrays without redundant computations.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumBeauty = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let maxBeauty = 0;
    
    let left = 0;
    let frequency = {};
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        let current = nums[right];
        
        // Adjust the frequency count of the current element
        frequency[current] = (frequency[current] || 0) + 1;
        
        // Maintain the condition of maximum and minimum difference being at most 1
        while (Math.max(...Object.keys(frequency).map(Number)) - Math.min(...Object.keys(frequency).map(Number)) > 1) {
            frequency[nums[left]] -= 1;
            if (frequency[nums[left]] === 0) {
                delete frequency[nums[left]];
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        // Calculate the length of the current valid subarray
        maxBeauty = Math.max(maxBeauty, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxBeauty;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize variables:** Track `maxBeauty` for the longest valid subarray found, `left` pointer for the sliding window's start, and `frequency` to maintain the count of each element in the window.
2. **Iterate with `right` pointer:** For each element:
   - Update its count in the frequency map.
   - If the difference between the maximum and minimum keys of the frequency map exceeds 1, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the condition is satisfied.
   - Update `maxBeauty` with the length of the current valid subarray.
3. **Return result:** After iterating through the array, return the maximum beauty found.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot \log n)\) due to:
  - Iterating through each element once: \(O(n)\)
  - Calculating max and min from frequency keys: \(O(\log n)\) each time it's needed (since keys are a Set-like structure).

This solution ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum beauty of the array with the sliding window technique while considering the given constraints on the allowed operations per element.
