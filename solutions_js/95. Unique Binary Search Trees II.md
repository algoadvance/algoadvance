[Leetcode 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l95)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return all the structurally unique BST's (binary search trees), which has exactly `n` nodes of unique values from 1 to `n`. Return the answer in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume `n` is always a positive integer?
   - Yes, `n` will always be a positive integer.
   
2. Are the node values always consecutive integers from 1 to `n`?
   - Yes, the node values are always consecutive integers starting from 1 to `n`.

3. Do we need to consider time and space complexity for generating and storing the trees?
   - Yes, we should consider both time and space complexity.

## Strategy

1. **Recursion Approach:** We can solve the problem using a recursive approach. The idea is to select each number from 1 to `n` as the root, then recursively generate all possible left subtrees from the numbers less than the root, and all possible right subtrees from the numbers greater than the root.
   - For each selected root value, generate all possible left and right subtrees.
   - Combine each left subtree with each right subtree and attach them to the root.
   - Continue this process until all possible trees are generated.

2. **Tree Node Definition:** We will define a TreeNode class to construct the tree nodes.

3. **Helper Function:** A function to generate trees with root values ranging from `start` to `end`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is somewhat challenging to define precisely because it involves constructing combinations of sub-problems; however, it's known that generating all unique BSTs is related to the Catalan number. The nth Catalan number is \( C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n} \), which gives us an idea of the number of unique BST configurations. Each tree generation step involves both left and right subtree generation recursively.

## Implementation

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var generateTrees = function(n) {
    if (n === 0) return [];
    
    // Helper function to generate all BSTs with nodes in range [start, end]
    function generate(start, end) {
        let allTrees = [];
        
        if (start > end) {
            allTrees.push(null);
            return allTrees;
        }
        
        // Loop through each number as a root
        for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            // Generate all left subtrees with values less than i
            let leftTrees = generate(start, i - 1);
            // Generate all right subtrees with values greater than i
            let rightTrees = generate(i + 1, end);
            
            // Combine each left and right subtree with the root i
            for (let left of leftTrees) {
                for (let right of rightTrees) {
                    let currentTree = new TreeNode(i);
                    currentTree.left = left;
                    currentTree.right = right;
                    allTrees.push(currentTree);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return allTrees;
    }
    
    // Generate all BSTs with nodes from 1 to n
    return generate(1, n);
};
```

## Conclusion

This solution effectively utilizes recursion to generate all unique BSTs by considering each possible root and constructing left and right subtrees recursively. Although it's a recursive solution, it's structured to manage complexity while focusing on the range of node values, ensuring that all unique structures are considered.
