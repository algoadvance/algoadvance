[Leetcode 386. Lexicographical Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l386)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 386: Lexicographical Numbers**

Given an integer `n`, return 1 to `n` in lexicographical order.

For example, given `n` = 13, return the list:
\[1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\].

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the numbers guaranteed to be positive?
   **A:** Yes, `n` is a positive integer.
   
2. **Q:** Can `n` be very large?
   **A:** The value of `n` is restrained by typical problem constraints but it can be sufficiently large to warrant an efficient algorithm.

3. **Q:** Do we need to consider memory constraints for this problem?
   **A:** No specific constraints are mentioned. We can consider that the memory usage should be in line with the problem size, i.e., should handle arrays of up to `n` integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, a Depth First Search (DFS) approach can be employed. We can simulate the counting using DFS by appending digits from 0 to 9 to our current number and ensuring we do not exceed `n`.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty array to store the result.
2. Execute DFS starting from numbers 1 to 9 (since we want to cover all decimal digits, except starting with 0).
3. For each DFS call, append the current number to the result list.
4. Iterate through numbers 0 to 9, appending each digit to the current number and making a recursive DFS call, ensuring the number stays within the limit `n`.

### Code

```javascript
var lexicalOrder = function(n) {
    const result = [];
    
    const dfs = (current) => {
        if (current > n) return;
        result.push(current);
        for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            let next = current * 10 + i;
            if (next > n) break;
            dfs(next);
        }
    };

    for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        dfs(i);
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(lexicalOrder(13)); // [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above approach is \(O(n)\) since each number from 1 to `n` contributes exactly one item to the result array and each number is processed in constant time due to the DFS tree traversal.

### Key Takeaways

1. A DFS approach is suitable for generating lexicographically sorted numbers efficiently.
2. The complexity remains manageable at \(O(n)\), making it scalable for large values of `n`.
3. Structuring the problem with recursion allows us to explore each possible decimal digit incrementally while maintaining order.
