[Leetcode 2931. Maximum Spending After Buying Items](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2931)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `budget` and an array of integers `costs` where each element in the array represents the cost of a different item. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money spent by exactly buying a subset of items without exceeding the given budget. 

Return the maximum spending that can be achieved under these conditions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is each item's cost a positive integer?**
   Yes, each item’s cost is a positive integer.

2. **What should be returned if no items can be purchased within the budget?**
   If no items can be purchased within the budget, the maximum spending should be `0`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the budget or the `costs` array?**
   Typically, the constraints would be similar to those in competitive programming environments, but those will be listed if any. For simplicity, let’s assume the `costs` array can have up to 1000 items and the budget can be up to 10^9.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach similar to the Knapsack problem will be effective. Here’s a detailed strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table (DP):**
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a budget `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `0`, because no money is spent when no items are purchased.

2. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - Iterate through each item in the `costs` array.
   - For each item, iterate backward through the `dp` array from the given `budget` down to the cost of the item.
   - Update each `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - cost] + cost`.

3. **Result:**
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumSpending(budget, costs) {
    const dp = new Array(budget + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let cost of costs) {
        for (let j = budget; j >= cost; j--) {
            dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - cost] + cost);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[budget];
}

// Example Usage:
const budget = 50;
const costs = [20, 30, 40];
console.log(maximumSpending(budget, costs));  // Output: 50
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Let `n` be the number of items and `B` be the budget.
  - The time complexity is `O(n * B)` because we are iterating through each cost and updating the `dp` array which has a size of `B`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(B)` for storing the `dp` array.

This solution effectively finds the maximum spending without exceeding the budget using a dynamic programming approach similar to the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.
