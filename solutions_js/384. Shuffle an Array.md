### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 384: Shuffle an Array

Given an integer array `nums`, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. All permutations of the array should be equally likely as a result of the shuffling.

Implement the `Solution` class:
- `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- `int[] reset()` Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
- `int[] shuffle()` Returns a random shuffling of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we modify the input array `nums`, or do we need to work with a copy?
   - We should work with a copy to ensure the original array can be reset.
   
2. Can the input array contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates, and they should be treated just like any other values during shuffling.
   
3. Is there any memory constraint we should be aware of?
   - No special constraints, just handle the problem efficiently.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the original array, so it can be returned in the `reset` method.
   - Create a working copy of the array for shuffling purposes.

2. **Reset Method**:
   - Return the stored original array.

3. **Shuffle Method**:
   - Use Fisher-Yates (Knuth) algorithm to generate random permutations. This algorithm ensures every permutation is equally probable.

Steps for Fisher-Yates algorithm:
- Iterate through the array from the last element to the first.
- For each element, generate a random index such that the element at the current index can be swapped with any element before it (including itself).
- Swap the current element with the element at the random index.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Solution {
    constructor(nums) {
        this.original = nums.slice();  // Store original array.
        this.array = nums.slice();     // Working copy for shuffling.
    }
    
    reset() {
        this.array = this.original.slice();
        return this.array;
    }
    
    shuffle() {
        for (let i = this.array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
            [this.array[i], this.array[j]] = [this.array[j], this.array[i]];
        }
        return this.array;
    }
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const obj = new Solution(nums);
console.log(obj.shuffle()); // Randomly shuffled array
console.log(obj.reset());   // Resets to original array [1, 2, 3]
console.log(obj.shuffle()); // Another random shuffle
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (constructor)**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- **Reset**: O(n), because we are creating a copy of the `original` array.
- **Shuffle**: O(n), each element is swapped once in a single traversal of the array.

### Summary

The solution efficiently shuffles the array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm ensuring all permutations are equally likely and provides a means to reset it back to its original state. The operations are linear in terms of time complexity concerning the size of the input array.
