[Leetcode 2030. Smallest K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2030)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, an integer `k`, and a character `letter`, you need to find the lexicographically smallest k-length subsequence of `s` that contains exactly `num` occurrences of `letter`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the Lengths**:
    - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
    - What is the range for `k` and `num`?

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if `k` is larger than the length of `s`?
    - What if it's impossible to find a k-length subsequence with exactly `num` occurrences of `letter`?

3. **Character Set**:
    - Is the string `s` composed of lowercase English letters only?

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we will employ a greedy algorithm as it will help us obtain the smallest lexicographically sequence while ensuring that the subsequence meets the count requirement.

1. **Greedy Approach**:
    - Traverse the string from left to right.
    - Maintain a stack to keep track of the characters for the subsequence.
    - Ensure the subsequence has exactly `num` occurrences of `letter` and is of length `k`.
    - At each step, check if including the current character would help achieve the goal, considering the remaining length of the string and the remaining characters required.

### Code

```javascript
function smallestKLengthSubsequence(s, k, letter, num) {
    const n = s.length;
    let letterCount = 0; // Count of 'letter' characters in s
    let stack = []; // Stack to build the final answer

    // Count total occurrences of 'letter' in the entire string.
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === letter) {
            letterCount++;
        }
    }

    let remaining = letterCount; // Remaining 'letter' characters to be processed.
    let usedLetters = 0; // 'letter' characters used in the stack.

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const currentChar = s[i];
        
        // Handle while there's a chance to remove and get a better sequence
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > currentChar &&
               (stack.length + n - i - 1 >= k) && 
               (stack[stack.length - 1] !== letter || usedLetters + remaining > num)) {
            
            if (stack.pop() === letter) {
                usedLetters--;
            }
        }

        // Add currentChar to the stack if it maintains the number of 'letter' characters
        if (stack.length < k) {
            if (currentChar === letter) {
                stack.push(currentChar);
                usedLetters++;
            } else if (stack.length + Math.max(0, num - usedLetters) < k) {
                stack.push(currentChar);
            }
        }
        
        // Adjust remaining 'letter' characters
        if (currentChar === letter) {
            remaining--;
        }
    }
    
    return stack.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestKLengthSubsequence("aaabbbccc", 4, 'a', 2)); // Output example "aabc"
console.log(smallestKLengthSubsequence("deabcdeabcdea", 5, 'e', 1)); // Output example "abcde"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed a limited number of times due to the stack operations, making the algorithm efficient for larger inputs within the typical competitive programming constraints.
