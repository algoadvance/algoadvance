[Leetcode 133. Clone Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l133)
### Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(val, neighbors) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors;
    }
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph connected?**
   - Yes, the graph is connected.

2. **Can we assume there are no duplicate values in the graph?**
   - Yes, we can assume there are no duplicate values for simplicity but the cloning should not depend on node values.

3. **What should we do about cyclic graphs?**
   - Cyclic graphs should be handled correctly by keeping track of visited nodes.

4. **Are node values unique?**
   - For the sake of this problem, we can assume node values are unique.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * class Node {
 *     constructor(val, neighbors) {
 *         this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
 *         this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors;
 *     }
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {Node} node
 * @return {Node}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(node) {
    if (!node) return null;

    let nodeMap = new Map();

    function clone(node) {
        if (nodeMap.has(node)) {
            return nodeMap.get(node);
        }

        let clonedNode = new Node(node.val);
        nodeMap.set(node, clonedNode);
        
        for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {
            clonedNode.neighbors.push(clone(neighbor));
        }

        return clonedNode;
    }

    return clone(node);
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Use a Map to track visited nodes**: This ensures that each node is cloned only once and helps in handling cycles without causing a stack overflow.

2. **Recursive DFS for cloning**: 
   - Start from the given node.
   - For each node, create a clone and store it in the map.
   - Recursively clone all its neighbors.
   - Add the clone of each neighbor to the neighbors of the cloned node.

3. **Base Case**: If the graph node is null, return null.

4. **Utilize the Map within a recursive function** to ensure every node and its neighbors are cloned correctly, even in the presence of cycles.

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity: O(N + E)**

- **N** is the number of nodes in the graph.
- **E** is the number of edges.
- Each node and edge is visited exactly once, leading to this linear complexity.

**Space Complexity: O(N)**

- Due to the extra space used by the recursive stack and the map to store the cloned nodes.
