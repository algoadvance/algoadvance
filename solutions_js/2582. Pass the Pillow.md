[Leetcode 2582. Pass the Pillow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2582)
### Problem Statement

You are given n persons standing in a line, numbered from 1 to n, with person 1 holding a pillow. The pillow is passed to the next person every second, moving from person 1 to person n, then back to person 1, in a cycle.

Given a time t in seconds, return the number of the person who holds the pillow after t seconds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the movement of the pillow unidirectional or bidirectional?**
   - The movement is bidirectional. It moves from person 1 to person n and then back to person 1.

2. **What are the constraints?**
   - The values of `n` and `t` will be within a range that allows for a feasible solution within the execution time limits.

3. **Can t be zero or negative?**
   - If `t` is zero, then the pillow remains with person 1.
   - `t` should not be negative.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to track the position of the pillow as it moves back and forth along the line of persons. Each complete cycle (from person 1 to n and back to person 1) takes `(2 * n - 2)` seconds.

1. First, determine the number of complete cycles the pillow has made by dividing `t` by `(2 * n - 2)`.
2. Calculate the remainder of `t`, which tells us how far into the current cycle we are.
3. Depending on the remainder, you can directly find which person is holding the pillow:
   - If the remainder is less than `n - 1`, the pillow is moving forward.
   - Otherwise, the pillow is moving backward.

### Code

```javascript
function passThePillow(n, t) {
    // Each full cycle (1 to n and back to 1) length
    const cycleLength = 2 * (n - 1);
    
    // Calculate the position in the current cycle
    const remainder = t % cycleLength;
    
    // Determine the position based on remainder
    if (remainder < n) {
        // Moving forward
        return remainder + 1;
    } else {
        // Moving backward
        return 2 * n - remainder - 1;
    }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(passThePillow(4, 5));  // Output: 2
console.log(passThePillow(3, 2));  // Output: 3
console.log(passThePillow(5, 10)); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The solution runs in constant time, O(1), because the calculations are done using basic arithmetic operations without any loops or complex constructs. 

This ensures that even for a very large `t`, the solution will execute efficiently.
