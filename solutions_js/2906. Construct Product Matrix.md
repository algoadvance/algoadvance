[Leetcode 2906. Construct Product Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2906)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, construct a product matrix out. A product matrix is defined as a two-dimensional array where each element out[i][j] is equal to the product of all elements of nums except nums[i].

For example:
- Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Output: out = [
                  [24, 12, 8, 6],
                  [12, 6, 4, 3],
                  [8, 4, 3, 2],
                  [6, 3, 2, 1]
                ]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: Are there any constraints on the size or values of the input array?
2. **Handling zeros**: How should the function handle zeros in the input array, since they would affect the product?
3. **Space complexity constraints**: Is there any specific requirement for the space complexity of the solution?
4. **Expected output type**: Should the output be a matrix (2D array) and should it be returned or printed?

### Strategy

To construct the product matrix:
1. **Prefix Products**: Calculate the product of all elements before each element.
2. **Suffix Products**: Calculate the product of all elements after each element.
3. **Compute Each Row**: Using the prefix and suffix products, compute the elements for each row in the product matrix.

Here is a breakdown:
- Iterate through the array, calculating and storing prefix and suffix products.
- Use these to compute the desired products for each element in the array.

### Code

Here's the complete JavaScript solution:

```javascript
function constructProductMatrix(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const prefixProducts = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const suffixProducts = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const out = Array.from(Array(n), () => new Array(n).fill(1));

    // Calculate prefix products
    let prefix = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixProducts[i] = prefix;
        prefix *= nums[i];
    }

    // Calculate suffix products
    let suffix = 1;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        suffixProducts[i] = suffix;
        suffix *= nums[i];
    }

    // Constructing the product matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == j) {
                out[i][j] = prefixProducts[j] * suffixProducts[j];
            } else {
                out[i][j] = prefixProducts[j] * suffixProducts[j] / nums[j];
            }
        }
    }

    return out;
}

// Test the function with an example input
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(constructProductMatrix(nums));
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n^2)**:
- Computing prefix products: **O(n)**
- Computing suffix products: **O(n)**
- Constructing the product matrix: **O(n^2)** (nested loops)

The space complexity is **O(n^2)** due to the output product matrix. The additional space used by the prefix and suffix arrays is **O(n)**.

### Conclusion

This code constructs the product matrix as defined, efficiently handling the computations by leveraging prefix and suffix products. Make sure to validate this solution against various test cases, including scenarios with zeros and different array lengths.
