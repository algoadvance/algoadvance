[Leetcode 557. Reverse Words in a String III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l557)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` which consists of words and spaces. Your task is to reverse the order of characters in each word while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

#### Example
- Input: `s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"`
- Output: `"s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input string contain leading or trailing whitespace?
   **A:** No, the problem statement ensures that the input string has no leading or trailing whitespaces.
   
2. **Q:** Can the input string contain multiple spaces between words?
   **A:** No, each word in the input string is separated by a single space.

3. **Q:** Are all words in the input string made up of only alphabetic characters?
   **A:** While the problem statement does not specify this, for simplicity, we assume that words contain only alphabetic characters or possibly include apostrophes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Split the String:** Split the input string into an array of words.
2. **Reverse Each Word:** Iterate over each word, reverse it, and store it in a new array.
3. **Join the Words:** Join the reversed words with a space to form the final output string.

### Code

```javascript
function reverseWords(s) {
    // Split the string by spaces to get an array of words
    let words = s.split(' ');
    
    // Map each word to its reversed version
    let reversedWords = words.map(word => word.split('').reverse().join(''));
    
    // Join the reversed words with a space to form the final result
    return reversedWords.join(' ');
}

// Test the function with an example input
console.log(reverseWords("Let's take LeetCode contest")); // Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the String:** Splitting the string takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string.
- **Reversing Each Word:** Reversing each word takes O(m) time where m is the length of the word. Since there could be k words, the total time is approximately O(n).
- **Joining the Words:** Joining the words also takes O(n) time.

Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string. This is efficient and optimal for the given problem.
