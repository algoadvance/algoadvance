[Leetcode 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2181)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by `0`'s. The task is to merge nodes between each pair of zeroes into a single node. Specifically, you need to replace each segment of non-zero nodes (which is between two `0`'s) with a single node whose value is equal to the sum of those nodes. 

For example:
- Input: `0 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0`
- Output: `4 -> 11`

Here, the segments `3 -> 1` and `4 -> 5 -> 2` are each between pairs of zeroes and should be replaced by `4` and `11`, respectively.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input linked list ever be empty? (Assume it wonâ€™t be empty.)
2. Will the linked list always start and end with a zero? (Assume yes for this problem.)
3. Are other constraints such as maximum length of the list or value of nodes relevant? (Assume standard constraints.)

### Strategy
1. Traverse through the linked list.
2. Maintain a sum variable to accumulate values between zero nodes.
3. Once a zero node is encountered and if the sum is greater than zero, create a new node with this sum and append it to the result list.
4. Continue this until the end of the linked list.
5. Return the newly created list.

### Code
```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

var mergeNodes = function(head) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummy;
    
    let sum = 0;
    while (head !== null) {
        if (head.val === 0) {
            if (sum > 0) {
                current.next = new ListNode(sum);
                current = current.next;
                sum = 0;
            }
        } else {
            sum += head.val;
        }
        head = head.next;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
};

// Example usage:
const head = new ListNode(0, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(1, new ListNode(0, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(5, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(0))))))));
const result = mergeNodes(head);
let node = result;
while (node !== null) {
    console.log(node.val);
    node = node.next;
}
```

### Explanation
1. A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases handling and to easily return the head of the resulting list.
2. We iterate through the input list while maintaining a cumulative sum between zeros.
3. When we encounter a zero, if the sum is non-zero (indicating the end of a segment), a new node is created and appended to the result list.
4. We reset the sum to zero after creating each new node.
5. Finally, the head of the merged nodes list (excluding the initial dummy node) is returned.

### Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the list once where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
2. **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use a few extra variables for bookkeeping (apart from the new list that we construct).

This efficient approach ensures we only pass through the input list a single time and don't allocate unnecessary space.
