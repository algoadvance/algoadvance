[Leetcode 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1657)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, they are considered close if you can attain one string from the other using the following operations exactly:

1. Swap any two existing characters.
2. Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

Return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are close, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length of Strings**: Do both strings have to be of the same length?
    - **Yes**, both strings must have the same length to be considered close.
    
2. **Character Set**: Are there any restrictions on the character set, e.g., only lowercase English letters?
    - **Yes**, the problem assumes that the strings consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **Empty Strings**: What should be the output if either of the strings is empty?
    - Given that both strings need to be of equal length, if one is empty, both must be empty; thus return `true`.

### Strategy

To determine if the two strings are close, we can follow this strategy:

1. **Check Length**: First, check if the lengths of `word1` and `word2` are equal. If not, return `false`.
2. **Character Sets**: Check if both words contain the same set of unique characters. If not, return `false`.
3. **Character Frequency**: Check if both words have the same character frequency distribution. If the frequencies (sorted) match, then the words can be rearranged/converted.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function closeStrings(word1, word2) {
    if (word1.length !== word2.length) {
        return false;
    }

    const countChars = (word) => {
        let charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let char of word) {
            charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        return charCount;
    };

    const charCount1 = countChars(word1);
    const charCount2 = countChars(word2);

    // Compare the sets of characters
    if (!charCount1.every((count, index) => (count > 0) === (charCount2[index] > 0))) {
        return false;
    }

    // Compare the sorted frequencies of characters
    charCount1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    charCount2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (charCount1[i] !== charCount2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Count Characters**: Counting characters in each word takes O(n), where `n` is the length of the words.
- **Compare Sets**: Checking if both character sets are the same takes O(1) due to the fixed size of the comparison (26 letters).
- **Sort Frequencies**: Sorting the frequencies has a time complexity of O(26 log 26), which simplifies to O(1) due to the constants involved.
- **Total Complexity**: Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by counting characters, making it O(n).

This solution efficiently checks if two strings are close by validating length, character set, and frequency distribution in a linear time complexity relative to the string length.
