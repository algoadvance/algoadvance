[Leetcode 2162. Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2162)
### Problem Statement 

You are given a kitchen timer set at `currentTime`, which contains a string in the format "MM:SS". You also have a target time provided as an integer `targetSeconds`, representing the time you want to achieve by adding more time to the current timer. 

Every minute (60 seconds) you can add using the "+1 minute" button costs `minuteCost` (an integer), and every second you add using the "+1 second" button costs `secondCost` (an integer).

Write a function `minCostSetTime` that returns the minimum cost to set the timer to `targetSeconds` from `currentTime`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the inputs such as the size of `targetSeconds`, `minuteCost`, and `secondCost`?
2. Are there any edge cases we need to consider such as setting the timer from `00:00` to another time?
3. What happens if the timer already shows the target time?

### Strategy

1. **Parse Current Time:** Convert `currentTime` from "MM:SS" to total seconds.
2. **Calculate Needed Time:** Determine how many additional seconds are needed to reach `targetSeconds`.
3. **Determine Cost Options:**
   - Calculate different combinations of minutes and seconds that can achieve the required target.
   - Ensure that combinations are valid (e.g., MM < 100).
4. **Cost Calculation:** For each valid combination, compute the total cost and find the minimum.

### Time Complexity

The solution involves parsing the time and iterating through possible minute-second combinations to find the minimum cost. The complexity is O(1) as the limits on minutes and seconds are fixed.

### Code

```javascript
function minCostSetTime(currentTime, targetSeconds, minuteCost, secondCost) {
    // Helper function to convert MM:SS to total seconds
    function parseTime(time) {
        const [minutes, seconds] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return minutes * 60 + seconds;
    }

    // Parse the current time
    const currentSeconds = parseTime(currentTime);
    // Total additional seconds needed
    const totalTimeNeeded = targetSeconds - currentSeconds;

    if (totalTimeNeeded <= 0) return 0;

    let minCost = Infinity;

    function calculateCost(minutes, seconds) {
        if (minutes < 0 || seconds < 0 || minutes >= 100 || seconds >= 60) {
            return Infinity;
        }
        const minAdded = minutes - Math.floor(currentSeconds / 60);
        const secAdded = seconds - (currentSeconds % 60);
        const totalMinCost = Math.max(minAdded * minuteCost, 0);
        const totalSecCost = Math.max(secAdded * secondCost, 0);
        return totalMinCost + totalSecCost;
    }

    for (let minutes = Math.floor(totalTimeNeeded / 60); minutes >= 0; --minutes) {
        const seconds = totalTimeNeeded - minutes * 60;
        const cost = calculateCost(minutes, seconds);
        if (cost < minCost) {
            minCost = cost;
        }
    }

    return minCost;
}

// Example use case
console.log(minCostSetTime("01:30", 5400, 5, 2)); // Adjust example input to match a real case.
```

### Explanation

1. **parseTime Function:**
   - Converts time in "MM:SS" format to total seconds.
2. **Initial Calculations:**
   - Calculates the total extra time needed from the `currentTime`.
3. **Combination Search:**
   - Examines feasible minute-second combinations to reach exactly the required extra time.
   - For each combination, it calculates the cost considering `minuteCost` and `secondCost`.
4. **Result:**
   - The function returns the minimum cost found among all valid combinations.
