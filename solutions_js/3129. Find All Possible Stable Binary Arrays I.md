[Leetcode 3129. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3129)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with finding all possible stable binary arrays given the constraints. A binary array is considered stable if, for every element:
- If it's `0`, all elements to its right are also `0`.
- If it's `1`, all elements to its right are also `1`.

Given an integer `n`, the length of the binary array, generate all possible stable binary arrays of that length.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on output format:** Should the output be in the form of an array of arrays where each sub-array represents a stable binary array?
2. **Constraints on `n`:** Is there a maximum value for `n` we should assume for performance considerations?

Assuming the output should be an array of arrays and the value of `n` is within reasonable bounds (e.g., â‰¤ 20) for performance, let's proceed with the solution.

## Strategy

For a binary array of length `n`, the following stable configurations are possible:
1. All elements set to `0`.
2. All elements set to `1`.
3. Any combination where the transition from `0` to `1` only happens at a single index and then continues with `1` till the end.

Given `n`, we generate:
- Array with all `0`s.
- For each position `i` from 0 to `n`, create an array where elements before `i` are `0`s and elements from `i` to `n-1` are `1`s.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
function generateStableBinaryArrays(n) {
    let result = [];
    
    // All 0's
    result.push(Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Variations of 0's followed by 1's
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        let arr = Array(i).fill(0).concat(Array(n - i).fill(1));
        result.push(arr);
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(generateStableBinaryArrays(3));
// Expected output:
// [
//   [0, 0, 0],  // All 0's
//   [1, 1, 1],  // All 1's
//   [0, 1, 1],  // Leading element(s) 0, followed by 1's
//   [0, 0, 1]   // Leading elements 0's, followed by 1
// ]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the function `generateStableBinaryArrays` is determined by the loop that runs `n + 1` times and the creation of arrays inside the loop:
- Creating an array of size `n` takes `O(n)` for each iteration.
- There are `n + 1` iterations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * (n + 1))` which simplifies to `O(n^2)`.
