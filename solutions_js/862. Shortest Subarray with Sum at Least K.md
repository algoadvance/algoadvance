[Leetcode 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l862)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of `nums` with a sum of at least `k`. If there is no such subarray, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2], k = 4
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [2,-1,2], k = 3
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `nums`?
2. Is it possible for the elements in `nums` to include both positive and negative integers?
3. What is the expected time complexity for an optimal solution?

## Strategy
This problem can be tackled using a sliding window approach commonly used for similar subarray problems. We'll employ the following strategy:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   We'll keep a running sum (prefix sum) and maintain a deque to store indices of elements that help form the minimum length subarray summing to at least `k`.

2. **Deque Utilization**:
   - The deque will store indices in an increasing order of their prefix sum values. This will help efficiently find candidate subarrays with valid sum.
   - Whenever the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the deque's front is greater than or equal to `k`, we can update our shortest subarray length.

3. **Iterate through the Array**:
   As we iterate through the array, we'll update the running sum and use the deque to maintain possible start indices of subarrays.

4. **Result**:
   At the end, if we have found any valid subarray, we return the minimum length else return `-1`.

## Code
Here is the JavaScript code implementing the solution:

```javascript
function shortestSubarray(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const prefixSum = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
    }
    
    const deque = [];
    let result = n + 1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n + 1; ++i) {
        while (deque.length && prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[deque[0]] >= k) {
            result = Math.min(result, i - deque.shift());
        }
        
        while (deque.length && prefixSum[i] <= prefixSum[deque[deque.length - 1]]) {
            deque.pop();
        }
        
        deque.push(i);
    }
    
    return result === n + 1 ? -1 : result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.

Space complexity is `O(n)` due to the prefix sum array and the deque used in the solution.
