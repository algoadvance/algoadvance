[Leetcode 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1092)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input strings be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible. If one of the strings is empty, the result should be the other string.

2. **Are the characters in the strings limited to any specific set (e.g., lowercase letters)?**
   - The problem does not specify any limitations, so we can assume any characters could be present.

3. **Does the order of characters matter in the result?**
   - Yes, the order should maintain the subsequences of both input strings as given.

4. **Will the length of the strings be within a manageable range for typical algorithms?**
   - Assume the input sizes are within a range that can be processed by typical algorithms reasonably.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
function shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2) {
    const m = str1.length;
    const n = str2.length;

    // DP table to store lengths of shortest common supersequences
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(''));

    // Populate the DP table
    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (i === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = str2.slice(0, j);
            } else if (j === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = str1.slice(0, i);
            } else if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + str1[i - 1];
            } else {
                const option1 = dp[i - 1][j] + str1[i - 1];
                const option2 = dp[i][j - 1] + str2[j - 1];
                dp[i][j] = option1.length <= option2.length ? option1 : option2;
            }
        }
    }

    // The value in dp[m][n] will be the length of the shortest common supersequence
    return dp[m][n];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(shortestCommonSupersequence("abac", "cab")); // Output: "cabac"
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the shortest common supersequence of the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`.
 
2. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][j]` is initialized with the prefix of `str2` up to `j` because if `str1` is empty, the supersequence is just `str2`.
   - `dp[i][0]` is initialized with the prefix of `str1` up to `i` because if `str2` is empty, the supersequence is just `str1`.

3. **Filling the Table**:
   - If the characters `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]` are the same, they must be part of the supersequence, and thus `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + str1[i-1]`.
   - If they are different, the supersequence can be obtained by either adding `str1[i-1]` to `dp[i-1][j]` or `str2[j-1]` to `dp[i][j-1]`. We choose the smaller of the two lengths.

4. **Result**: The final answer is in `dp[m][n]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`. This is because we're filling out an `m x n` DP table and each cell computation takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required shortest common supersequence.
