## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1054: Distant Barcodes

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `i-th` barcode is `barcodes[i]`.

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer that satisfies this requirement.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: [1,3,1,2,1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Output Format:** Should the output just be an array of integers that satisfy the condition?
   - *Yes, the output should just be a rearranged array of barcodes where no two adjacent elements are the same.*

2. **Multiple Solutions:** If there are multiple valid solutions, is returning any one of them acceptable?
   - *Yes, any valid rearrangement is acceptable.*

3. **Input Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the barcode frequencies that I need to handle, e.g., can there be cases where it's impossible to rearrange the barcodes?
   - *No, based on the problem statement constraints, it will always be possible to rearrange the barcodes as required.*

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count:** Use a hash map to count the frequency of each barcode to understand which ones are most frequent.
2. **Max Heap:** Use a max heap (priority queue) to always pick the barcode with the highest frequency that can be placed next in the sequence.
3. **Rearrange:** Iterate through the barcodes, each time picking the most frequent barcode that is not the same as the last placed barcode.
4. **Alternative Placement:** Ensure alternate placement such that maximum utilized occurs in a way that both valid and the same used barcode frequency.

## Code

```javascript
const rearrangeBarcodes = (barcodes) => {
  const freqMap = new Map();
  barcodes.forEach(barcode => {
    freqMap.set(barcode, (freqMap.get(barcode) || 0) + 1);
  });

  const maxHeap = [];
  for (let [barcode, freq] of freqMap) {
    maxHeap.push({barcode, freq});
  }

  maxHeap.sort((a, b) => b.freq - a.freq);

  const result = [];
  while (maxHeap.length > 1) {
    // Take out the two most frequent elements
    let first = maxHeap.shift();
    let second = maxHeap.shift();

    // Append them to the result array
    result.push(first.barcode);
    result.push(second.barcode);

    // Decrement their counts and reinsert if they are still > 0
    if (--first.freq > 0) maxHeap.push(first);
    if (--second.freq > 0) maxHeap.push(second);

    maxHeap.sort((a, b) => b.freq - a.freq);
  }

  if (maxHeap.length === 1) {
    result.push(maxHeap[0].barcode);
  }

  return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(rearrangeBarcodes([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3])); // Output: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3] or other valid permutations
console.log(rearrangeBarcodes([1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3])); // Output: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3] or other valid permutations
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be broken down into:

1. **Frequency Count:** O(N), where N is the length of the `barcodes` array.
2. **Building the Heap:** O(M*logM), where M is the number of unique barcodes.
3. **Heap Operations in While Loop:**
   - Each operation of extracting the top two elements and re-inserting them is O(log M).
   - Since we have to process all elements in the `barcodes` array, the overall complexity for this part is O(N * logM).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(N * logM), which is efficient for the constraints provided.
