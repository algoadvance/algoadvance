[Leetcode 2583. Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2583)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree where each node contains an integer value. The sum of each level in the binary tree is defined as the sum of all node values in that level. You need to find the k-th largest level sum in the binary tree.

For example, given the binary tree:

```
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \   \ 
   4   5   6
```

The level sums would be:
- Level 1: 1
- Level 2: 2 + 3 = 5
- Level 3: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

If k = 2, the k-th largest level sum is 5.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What if `k` is larger than the number of levels in the binary tree?**
   - We can assume `k` will always be valid (i.e., `k` is within the range of the number of levels).

2. **Do node values have any specific constraints?**
   - Nodes can contain any integer value, positive or negative.

3. **In what format is the binary tree provided?**
   - The binary tree is given in a standard tree node format.
   
4. **Can all levels have negative sums?**
   - Yes, level sums can be negative if all nodes at that level have negative values.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

const kthLargestLevelSum = (root, k) => {
    if (!root) return null;
    
    const levelSums = [];
    const queue = [root];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        let levelSum = 0;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift();
            levelSum += node.val;
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
        levelSums.push(levelSum);
    }
    
    levelSums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    return levelSums[k - 1];
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We perform a BFS to traverse the tree level by level.
   - For each level, compute the sum of the node values.
   - Store each level's sum in an array.

2. **Sorting**:
   - After collecting all the level sums, sort the array in descending order.
   - The k-th largest sum will be at the `k-1` index in this sorted array.

## Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Traversing the tree takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of nodes.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array of level sums takes `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of levels (which is at most `O(log n)` for a balanced tree).

3. **Overall**:
   - The overall time complexity is `O(n + m log m)`.
   - For a balanced tree, this simplifies to `O(n + log n log log n)` which is effectively `O(n)` for large `n`.

In conclusion, the dominant factor is the tree traversal, so the overall complexity can be considered `O(n)`, making the solution efficient for large trees.
