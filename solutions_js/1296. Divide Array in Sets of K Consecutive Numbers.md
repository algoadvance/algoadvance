[Leetcode 1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1296)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers. Return `true` if it is possible, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the allowed range for the size of `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - The constraints will be same as typical LeetCode problems unless specified. Usually, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
   
2. **If `nums` is empty or `k` is 1, what should be the return value?**
   - If `nums` is empty, it should return `false` since there's nothing to divide. If `k` is 1, it should return `true` since each number can form a set by itself.

3. **Are there any guarantees on the input array, like being sorted?**
   - No, there are no guarantees that the input array is sorted.

4. **What if `k` is greater than the length of the array?**
   - It should return `false` since it's impossible to form a set containing `k` consecutive numbers if `k` is larger than the length of the array.
  
### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**: Use a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in the array.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the unique elements of the array to handle them in increasing order.
3. **Forming Sets**: For each element, try to form a set of `k` consecutive numbers using the frequency map.
   - For each number in the set, decrement the count in the frequency map.
   - If any count goes negative, it means it's not possible to form a required set with that number.

### Code

```javascript
function isPossibleDivide(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length % k !== 0) return false;
    
    // Create a frequency map
    let frequencyMap = new Map();
    for (let num of nums) {
        frequencyMap.set(num, (frequencyMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Sort the keys of the frequency map
    let keys = [...frequencyMap.keys()].sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Try to form sets of k consecutive numbers
    for (let num of keys) {
        let count = frequencyMap.get(num);
        if (count > 0) {
            for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                if (frequencyMap.get(num + i) == null || frequencyMap.get(num + i) < count) {
                    return false;
                }
                frequencyMap.set(num + i, frequencyMap.get(num + i) - count);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(isPossibleDivide([1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], 4)); // Output: true
console.log(isPossibleDivide([3,3,2,2,1,1], 3));     // Output: true
console.log(isPossibleDivide([1,2,3,4], 3));         // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is as follows:

1. **Creating Frequency Map**: \(O(n)\)
2. **Sorting Keys**: \(O(m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique keys in the frequency map.
3. **Forming Sets**: In the worst case, each check and update is \(O(1)\) and happens \(O(n)\) times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\). 

Given that \(m \leq n\), the algorithm is efficient for the typical constraints.
