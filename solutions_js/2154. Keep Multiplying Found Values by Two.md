[Leetcode 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2154)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `original`. You need to implement a function that performs the following operations iteratively:
1. If the `original` value is found in the `nums` array, multiply the `original` by 2.
2. Repeat step 1 as long as the `original` value is found in the array.
3. Return the final value of `original` after it can no longer be found in the `nums` array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the `nums` values unique?**
   - No, the values in `nums` are not guaranteed to be unique.
2. **What are the constraints on the lengths and values of `nums` and `original`?**
   - Assume `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `1 <= nums[i], original <= 10^4`.

### Strategy
1. Initialize a set to store the elements of `nums` for O(1) average-time lookups.
2. Use a loop to check if `original` is in the set.
3. If present, multiply `original` by 2. Continue this process until `original` is not found in the set.
4. Return the final value of `original`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of `nums`. The set creation takes O(n), and each lookup and potential update of `original` takes O(1) on average, but potentially needs to iterate through the entire process in the worst case if every value is doubled (logarithmic in relation to the maximum value constraint).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to storing the elements of `nums` in a set.

### Code

```javascript
function findFinalValue(nums, original) {
    // Create a set for the nums array
    let numSet = new Set(nums);
    
    // Check presence of original in the set and multiply by 2 if present
    while (numSet.has(original)) {
        original *= 2;
    }

    // Return the final value of original
    return original;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [5, 3, 6, 1, 12];
let original = 3;
console.log(findFinalValue(nums, original)); // Output should be 24
```

This approach effectively handles the problem by leveraging a set for quick lookups, ensuring the solution is both efficient and easy to understand.
