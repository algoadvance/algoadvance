[Leetcode 1521. Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1521)
## Problem Statement

We are given a sorted array `arr` of positive integers, and a mysterious function `func` which takes two integers `x` and `y` and returns the bitwise AND of `x` and `y`. 

Our task is to find a value `func(arr[i], arr[j])` that is closest to a given target. Here, `i` and `j` are indices of two elements in `arr`, and `i` <= `j`.

Given integers:
- `arr`, a sorted array of positive integers.
- `target`, an integer.

We want to find the value `func(arr[i], arr[j])` which is closest to `target`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the values in the array?
2. What is the length of the array?
3. Should the function handle edge cases, such as empty arrays?
4. Is the array always sorted?

## Strategy

1. Since `arr` is sorted, we will leverage bitwise AND properties. The bitwise AND of any subarray will always be equal to or smaller than the bitwise AND of any prefix of that subarray.
2. Maintain a variable to track the closest value to the target.
3. Iterate through each starting index of the subarray, calculate the bitwise AND for each subarray and update the closest value accordingly.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `closestValue` to `Infinity`.
2. Iterate through each element in `arr`:
   - For each element, compute the AND of every possible subarray starting from this element.
   - Update `closestValue` if the current AND is closer to the target.
3. Return the `closestValue`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var closestToTarget = function(arr, target) {
    // Initialize the closest value to Infinity
    let closestValue = Infinity;
    
    // Traverse each starting point of the subarray
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let currentAND = arr[i];
        
        // Traverse the subarray starting from index i
        for (let j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
            currentAND &= arr[j];
            closestValue = Math.min(closestValue, Math.abs(currentAND - target));
            
            // Early exit: if we have matched the exact target, return immediately
            if (closestValue === 0) {
                return currentAND;
            }
            
            // Further AND operations won't yield values closer to the target (because AND operations can only reduce the value)
            if (currentAND < target) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return closestValue;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the array. This is because for each element in the array, we iterate through all possible subarrays starting from that element.

- `O(n)` for the outer loop.
- `O(n)` for the inner loop in the worst case, making it `O(n * n) -> O(n^2)`.

This time complexity can be improved with more advanced techniques, but the given straightforward solution should handle medium-sized arrays efficiently.
