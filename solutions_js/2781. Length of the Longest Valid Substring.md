[Leetcode 2781. Length of the Longest Valid Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2781)
## Problem Statement
You are given two strings, `word` and `forbidden`. The `forbidden` string has distinct characters. Find the length of the longest valid substring of `word`, where a valid substring does not contain any of the characters in the `forbidden` string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the return value?**
   - The function should return an integer representing the length of the longest substring that doesn't contain any characters from `forbidden`.

2. **What if `word` or `forbidden` is an empty string?**
   - If `forbidden` is empty, every substring of `word` is valid. If `word` is empty, the result will be `0`, because no substring exists.

3. **Can we assume inputs are only lowercase English letters?**
   - For simplicity and typical constraints in such problems, we can assume `word` and `forbidden` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. Utilize a sliding window approach to check each substring of `word`.
2. Move the window from left to right, expanding it as long as the substring is valid.
3. If a forbidden character is encountered, adjust the left side of the window.

## Code
Here's the JavaScript function to determine the length of the longest valid substring:

```javascript
function longestValidSubstring(word, forbidden) {
    const forbiddenSet = new Set(forbidden);
    let left = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < word.length; right++) {
        while (left < right && forbiddenSet.has(word[right])) {
            left++;
        }
        if (!forbiddenSet.has(word[right])) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestValidSubstring("abcde", "cd")); // Output: 2 ("ab" or "de")
console.log(longestValidSubstring("leetcode", "le")); // Output: 4 ("tcode")
console.log(longestValidSubstring("aaaaa", "z")); // Output: 5 ("aaaaa")
console.log(longestValidSubstring("abcde", "")); // Output: 5 ("abcde")
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `word`. We traverse each character of the `word` only once with the sliding window technique.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the size of the `forbidden` set. We use this to check inclusion in constant time.
