[Leetcode 2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2207)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `text` and another string `pattern`. You need to return the maximum number of times the `pattern` can appear as a subsequence in `text` after inserting exactly one character anywhere in `text`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of Inputs:** What are the constraints on the lengths of `text` and `pattern`?
2. **Characters in Strings:** Are the strings limited to lowercase English letters?
3. **Pattern Length:** Can `pattern` be longer than `text`?
4. **Subsequence Definition:** Can `pattern` have overlapping subsequences in `text`?

Assuming these constraints:
- `text` and `pattern` are composed of lowercase English letters.
- The length of `text` and `pattern` can be large but manageable within typical competitive programming constraints (e.g., up to 10^4 for `text`).

### Strategy

1. **Count Subsequences Before Insertion:**
   - First, count how many times the `pattern` appears as a subsequence in the given `text`.

2. **Single Character Insertion:**
   - Iterate through each possible insertion point in `text` (which includes one position beyond the last character).
   - For each insertion point, simulate the insertion of each character ('a' to 'z') and count the resulting number of subsequences.

3. **Choose Maximum:**
   - Track the maximum number of subsequences found by trying all insertion positions and characters.

### Code

```javascript
function countSubsequences(text, pattern) {
    let m = pattern.length;
    if (m === 0) return 1;
    
    let dp = Array(m + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1; // An empty pattern is a subsequence of any string exactly once.
    
    for (let char of text) {
        for (let j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (char === pattern[j]) {
                dp[j + 1] += dp[j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m];
}

function maximizeSubsequences(text, pattern) {
    let maxCount = 0;
    
    for (let char = 'a'.charCodeAt(0); char <= 'z'.charCodeAt(0); char++) {
        let charToInsert = String.fromCharCode(char);
        
        for (let i = 0; i <= text.length; i++) {
            let newText = text.slice(0, i) + charToInsert + text.slice(i);
            let count = countSubsequences(newText, pattern);
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }
    }
    
    return maxCount;
}

// Example usage
const text = "abab";
const pattern = "ab";
console.log(maximizeSubsequences(text, pattern));  // Output depends on the textual input.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Subsequences (`countSubsequences`):** 
  - O(n * m) where `n` is the length of `text` and `m` is the length of `pattern`.

- **Maximizing Subsequences (`maximizeSubsequences`):**
  - Number of Insertion Points: O(n + 1)
  - Characters to Check: 26 (constant, a-z)
  - Subsequences Count per Inserted String: O(n * m)

Total Time Complexity: \( O(26 * (n + 1) * n * m) \) â‰ˆ \( O(n^2 * m) \)

This is efficient considering typical constraints for competitive programming problems.
