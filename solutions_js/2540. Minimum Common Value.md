[Leetcode 2540. Minimum Common Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2540)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in non-decreasing order. There is at least one common integer between the two arrays.

Let's define a common integer as an integer that appears in both `nums1` and `nums2`. Your task is to find the **minimum** common integer between the two arrays. If no common integer exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the arrays?**
   - No explicit constraints are mentioned, but we can assume they are reasonable to handle within typical problem-solving limits.
   
2. **Can both arrays contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, since the problem does not specify otherwise, both arrays can contain duplicates.
   
3. **Is the input guaranteed to have at least one common integer?**
   - Yes, the problem statement guarantees at least one common integer.

### Strategy
The fact that both arrays are sorted can significantly simplify the problem. We can use a two-pointer approach to find the minimum common integer:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to 0, each pointing to the start of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
2. Iterate through both arrays:
   - If `nums1[i]` is equal to `nums2[j]`, we've found a common integer, and since both arrays are sorted, this will be the smallest one.
   - If `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[j]`, increment `i` to move the pointer to the next element in `nums1`.
   - If `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[j]`, increment `j` to move the pointer to the next element in `nums2`.
3. Continue this process until a common integer is found. Given that there is at least one common integer, the loop will terminate once we find it.

### Code
```javascript
var getCommon = function(nums1, nums2) {
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    
    while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
        if (nums1[i] === nums2[j]) {
            return nums1[i];
        } else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // This line is redundant based on the problem's constraint
};

// Example usage:
let nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let nums2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(getCommon(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)** where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`. This is because in the worst case, we might end up scanning every element of both arrays once.
  
- The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a constant amount of additional space for the pointers `i` and `j`.

This approach leverages the sorted property of the arrays to efficiently find the minimum common integer.
