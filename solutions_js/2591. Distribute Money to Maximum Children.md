[Leetcode 2591. Distribute Money to Maximum Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2591)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `money` which represents the total amount of money you have, and an integer `children` which represents the number of children among whom you want to distribute the money. The goal is to maximize the number of children who receive exactly 8 units of money. Each child should get at least 1 unit of money.

Return the maximum possible number of children who can receive exactly 8 units of money. If it's not possible for any child to receive exactly 8 units of money, return `-1`.


## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the money be distributed in fractions or should it be whole units?
   - The problem implies that money should be distributed in whole units.

2. Can some children get different amounts of money while ensuring some get exactly 8 units?
   - Yes, the goal is to maximize the number of children receiving exactly 8 units, while others can receive different amounts as long as each gets at least 1 unit.

3. Should all of the money necessarily be distributed?
   - It's implied that all money should be used up.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Validation**: 
   - If there isn't enough money to give each child at least 1 unit, immediately return `-1`.

2. **Maximize Children with Exactly 8 Units**:
   - To maximize children getting exactly 8 units, we iteratively distribute 8 units to as many children as possible while ensuring the remaining children get at least 1 unit each.

3. **Iterate and Deduct**:
   - Start distributing 8 units to one child, then check if the remaining money and remaining children can each get at least 1 unit.
   - Continue this until you can no longer give 8 units to another child without violating the constraint.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the count of children who received exactly 8 units.

## Code

```javascript
function maxChildrenWithExactMoney(money, children) {
    if (money < children) return -1; // Not enough money to give each child at least 1 unit

    let maxChildrenWith8Units = 0;

    while (money >= 8 && children > 0) {
        // Give 8 units to one child
        maxChildrenWith8Units++;
        money -= 8; 
        children--;
        
        // Check if the remaining money is enough to give each of the remaining children 1 unit
        if (money < children) {
            maxChildrenWith8Units--;
            break;
        }
    }

    return maxChildrenWith8Units;
}

// Example usage
console.log(maxChildrenWithExactMoney(64, 7)); // 7
console.log(maxChildrenWithExactMoney(20, 4)); // 2
console.log(maxChildrenWithExactMoney(19, 3)); // 2
console.log(maxChildrenWithExactMoney(2, 2)); // -1
```

## Time Complexity

- The dominant operation is the while loop that continues until money is insufficient to give 8 units to another child or there are no more children left.
- Each iteration decreases either the `money` by 8 or the `children` by 1.
- Therefore, the time complexity is \( O(\min(money / 8, children)) \), which is effectively linear with respect to the number of children or the money divided by 8.

This solution should cover typical cases and edge cases effectively, ensuring we maximize the number of children receiving exactly 8 units of money wherever possible.
