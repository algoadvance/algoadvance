[Leetcode 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l453)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment `n - 1` elements of the array by 1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: What are the constraints on the values in the `nums` array?
   - **A**: There are no constraints mentioned, but typically we'll consider integer values both positive and negative.
   
2. **Q**: What is the expected output if the array is already composed of equal elements?
   - **A**: If all elements are already equal, the output should be `0`.

3. **Q**: Is the array always non-empty?
   - **A**: Yes, we can assume the array is non-empty, as the problem definition implies an existing array `nums` of size `n`.

### Strategy:
To make all elements in the array equal, we can think in terms of a reverse operation. Instead of incrementing `n - 1` elements, consider what happens in the operation where we effectively keep one element constant while decrementing the rest by `1`.

This mindset helps us observe that to make all elements equal, we need to consider the relative differences between elements. The strategy involves computing the total number of adjustments needed to make all elements equal to the smallest element in the array.

Steps to solve the problem:
1. Find the minimum element in the array.
2. Calculate the total number of moves required to make all elements equal to this minimum element. This can be achieved by calculating the sum of differences between each element and the minimum element.

### Code:

```javascript
function minMoves(nums) {
    // Step 1: Find the minimum element in the array
    let min = Math.min(...nums);
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the total moves required to get all elements to the minimum element
    let moves = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        moves += num - min;
    }
    
    return moves;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(minMoves(nums)); // Output: 3
```

### Explanation:
- First, we find the minimum value in the array using `Math.min` combined with the spread operator (`...nums`).
- Then, compute the difference between each element and this minimum value, summing these differences. This sum is the total number of moves needed.

### Time Complexity:
- Finding the minimum element: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- Computing the total moves involves iterating through the array once: `O(n)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
