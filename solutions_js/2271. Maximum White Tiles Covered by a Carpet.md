[Leetcode 2271. Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2271)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where `tiles[i] = [l_i, r_i]` represents a rectangular tile that covers the interval `[l_i, r_i]` (inclusive). You are also given an integer `carpetLen`, representing the length of a carpet that you can place over the tiles to cover some portion or all of the tiles. The tiles may overlap, and you can only report the length of tiles covered within the interval of the carpet. 
Return the maximum number of white tiles covered by the carpet.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Overlap Handling**: Should we account for overlapping tiles only once in the covered area, or do we count all contributions from overlapping tiles?
   - **Answer**: Overlapping tiles should be considered only once in the covered interval.
   
2. **Tiles Order**: Do the tiles array come sorted, or should we handle sorting internally?
   - **Answer**: The tiles array is not guaranteed to be sorted, so we should sort it internally based on the start of the intervals.

3. **Carpet Placing**: Can the carpet cover part of a tile, or does it need to cover whole tiles?
   - **Answer**: The carpet can cover part of a tile.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Tiles**: Start by sorting the tiles based on the left endpoint (`l_i`).
2. **Auxiliary Data Structures**:
   - `prefixSum[i]`: Use a prefix sum array `prefixSum` to store cumulative lengths of tiles up to the `i-th` tile.
   - Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum length covered by placing the carpet.
3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Iterate through each tile and try to place the carpet starting from the beginning of each tile.
   - Check how far the carpet can stretch and calculate the area it covers using the prefix sums.

## Code

Here is the solution using the above strategy:

```javascript
function maximumWhiteTiles(tiles, carpetLen) {
    tiles.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    const n = tiles.length;
    const prefixSum = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + (tiles[i][1] - tiles[i][0] + 1);
    }

    let maxCovered = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let end = tiles[i][0] + carpetLen - 1;
        let low = i, high = n - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (tiles[mid][1] <= end) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        let preSumEnd = high >= i ? prefixSum[high + 1] - prefixSum[i] : 0;
        let overlap = Math.max(0, end - tiles[high + 1][0] + 1);
        maxCovered = Math.max(maxCovered, preSumEnd + overlap);
    }
    
    return maxCovered;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n) for sorting the tiles.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n) for creating the prefix sum array.
- **Sliding Window with Binary Search**: O(n log n), for each tile, we perform a binary search to find the endpoint within the carpet's length.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).
