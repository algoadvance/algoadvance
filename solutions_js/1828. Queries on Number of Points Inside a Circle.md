[Leetcode 1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1828)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` is the coordinates of the `i-th` point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates. You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]` describes a circle centered at `(xj, yj)` with a radius `rj`.

For each query, compute the number of points inside the corresponding circle (i.e., points inside or on the border of the given circle).

Return an array `answer` where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j-th` query.

### Example
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
Output: [3,2,2]

Explanation: The points and queries are shown below. 
The points inside each query are (shown in green).

Query 1: everything within a range of 1 to (2, 3) yields 3 points.
Query 2: everything within a range of 1 to (4, 3) yields 2 points.
Query 3: everything within a range of 2 to (1, 1) yields 2 points.
```
### Constraints
- `1 <= points.length <= 500`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `1 <= xi, yi, xj, yj <= 500`
- `1 <= rj <= 500`
- All `points` are unique.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all points within the range [1, 500] both for xi and yi?**
   Yes, all points lie within the 2D plane with each coordinate between 1 and 500.
2. **Should the results include points exactly on the circumference of the circle?**
   Yes, points on the boundary of the circle should be included.

## Strategy
1. Iterate through each query.
2. For each query, iterate through the points to count how many are inside or on the circle.
3. Use the circle equation: `(xi - xj)² + (yi - yj)² <= rj²` to check if a point lies within or on the circle defined by query `(xj, yj, rj)`.
4. Append the count to the result list for each query.
5. Return the result list.

## Code
```javascript
var countPoints = function(points, queries) {
    const answer = [];
    
    for (const [qx, qy, qr] of queries) {
        let count = 0;
        const qrSquared = qr * qr;

        for (const [px, py] of points) {
            const dx = px - qx;
            const dy = py - qy;
            if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= qrSquared) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        answer.push(count);
    }
    
    return answer;
};

// Test the function with a sample data
let points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]];
let queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]];
console.log(countPoints(points, queries)); // Output should be [3, 2, 2]
```
## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is:
- **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of queries and `n` is the number of points:

For each query, we have to check every point to see if it lies inside or on the boundary of the circle defined by the query.
