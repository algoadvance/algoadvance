[Leetcode 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l891)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, return the sum of `widths` of all the non-empty subsequences of `nums`. The width of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subsequence. Since the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: `nums = [2, 1, 3]`
- **Output**: `6`
- **Explanation**: The subsequences are:
  - `[1]` with width `1-1 = 0`
  - `[2]` with width `2-2 = 0`
  - `[3]` with width `3-3 = 0`
  - `[1,2]` with width `2-1 = 1`
  - `[1,3]` with width `3-1 = 2`
  - `[2,3]` with width `3-2 = 1`
  - `[1,2,3]` with width `3-1 = 2`
  - Summing up all the widths `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6`

### Example 2:
- **Input**: `nums = [2]`
- **Output**: `0`
- **Explanation**: There is only one subsequence with width `0`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are the numbers in `nums` distinct?
   **A**: No, the array can contain duplicates.
2. **Q**: What is the range of the numbers in `nums`?
   **A**: Each number is within the range of `-10^9` to `10^9`.
3. **Q**: What is the size limit for the array `nums`?
   **A**: The size of the array `nums` can be up to `2000`.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: 
   - Sorting the array will help to easily find the minimum and maximum in any subsequence.

2. **Calculate Contributions**: 
   - For a number at index `i` in the sorted array,
     - `nums[i]` will be the maximum of some subsequences and the minimum of some subsequences.
     - Determine how many times `nums[i]` is maximum vs how many times `nums[i]` is minimum using combinatorial factors.
     - For every subset that `nums[i]` is the maximum, there are `2^i` possibilities.
     - For every subset that `nums[i]` is the minimum, there are `2^(n-i-1)` possibilities.

3. **Sum Contributions**:
   - Compute the sum contributions of being max and min, and return the difference.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Apply modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep results from overflowing.

## Code

```javascript
var sumSubseqWidths = function(nums) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = nums.length;
    let result = 0;
    
    const power2 = new Array(n).fill(1);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        power2[i] = (power2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result = (result + nums[i] * power2[i] - nums[i] * power2[n - 1 - i]) % MOD;
    }

    return (result + MOD) % MOD;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Computing power of 2 array**: O(n)
- **Main Loop**: O(n)

Overall complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
