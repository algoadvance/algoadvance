[Leetcode 1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1178)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of words and a list of puzzles. For each puzzle, you have to find out the number of words from the list of words that can be formed by the letters of the puzzle. A word can be formed by the puzzle if the word is a subset of the puzzle's letters and contains the first letter of the puzzle. Return an array of integers representing the number of valid words for each puzzle.

#### Example:
- **Input:**
  - `words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"]`
  - `puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]`
- **Output:**
  - `[1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 0]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Format of input and output?**
   - The input consists of a list of strings `words` and a list of strings `puzzles`.
   - The output is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of valid words for each puzzle.

2. **Constraints on the lengths of `words` and `puzzles`?**
   - `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
   - `4 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`
   - `1 <= words[i].length, puzzles[i].length <= 50`
   - Each word and puzzle contain only lowercase English letters.

3. **Are there any special characters or constraints we need to be careful with?**
   - Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.

### Strategy

1. **Bitmasks for Word Representation:**
   - Use bitmasking to represent each word. Convert each word to a binary number where each bit represents the presence of a letter.

2. **Filtering Words:**
   - Filter words to include only those that have lengths of 7 or less, as longer words can't match any puzzle.

3. **Puzzle Processing:**
   - For each puzzle, generate its bitmask and ensure the first letter must be present.
   - Iterate over all subsets of the puzzle’s characters using bit manipulation.

4. **Count Matching Words:**
   - Use a map to count occurrences of each bitmask representing words. Use this map to quickly compute how many words are valid for each puzzle.

### Code

```javascript
const findNumOfValidWords = (words, puzzles) => {
    const getBitmask = (word) => {
        let bitmask = 0;
        for (const char of word) {
            bitmask |= 1 << (char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0));
        }
        return bitmask;
    };

    const wordCount = {};
    for (const word of words) {
        const bitmask = getBitmask(word);
        if (word.length <= 7) {
            wordCount[bitmask] = (wordCount[bitmask] || 0) + 1;
        }
    }

    const results = [];
    for (const puzzle of puzzles) {
        const firstCharBit = 1 << (puzzle.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0));
        const puzzleBitmask = getBitmask(puzzle);
        let submask = puzzleBitmask;
        let count = 0;

        while (submask) {
            if ((submask & firstCharBit) !== 0 && wordCount[submask] !== undefined) {
                count += wordCount[submask];
            }
            submask = (submask - 1) & puzzleBitmask;
        }
        
        results.push(count);
    }

    return results;
};

// Example usage:
const words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"];
const puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"];
console.log(findNumOfValidWords(words, puzzles)); // Output: [1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Words:**
  - Converting each word to a bitmask takes O(L) where L is the average length of the word.
  - Inserting each word bitmask into the map takes O(1).
  - Total complexity for preprocessing: **O(N * L)**
  
- **Processing Puzzles:**
  - Converting each puzzle to a bitmask takes O(K) where K is the length of each puzzle (max 7).
  - Considering all subsets of a puzzle’s characters will take O(2^K - 1), or O(128) since max length of a puzzle is 7.
  - For each puzzle: iterating through subsets and checking the map takes constant time given limited subsets.
  - Total complexity for puzzles: **O(M * 2^K) => O(M * 128) => O(M)**

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - **O(N * L + M)**, where N is the number of words, L is the length of the longest word, and M is the number of puzzles.
