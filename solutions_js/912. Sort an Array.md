## Problem Statement

Leetcode 912: Sort an Array

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the sorting be done in-place or can we use additional memory?**
   - We can use additional memory as needed.

2. **Are there any specific sorting algorithms that need to be used?**
   - No, any efficient sorting algorithm can be employed.

3. **How should duplicate values be handled?**
   - Duplicates should be handled naturally by the sorting algorithm, resulting in duplicate values appearing consecutively in the sorted array.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, it is essential to use a sorting algorithm with good average time complexity, typically O(n log n). Possible choices include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. JavaScript's built-in `Array.prototype.sort` method can also be used, which typically uses the Timsort algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.

To solve this problem, we will use the `Array.prototype.sort` method for simplicity and efficiency.

## Code

```javascript
function sortArray(nums) {
    return nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Sorting Function**: The `sort` method is called on the `nums` array.
2. **Comparator**: The comparator `(a, b) => a - b` ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order. It returns a negative value if `a` should come before `b`, zero if `a` and `b` are equal as far as sorting order, and a positive value if `a` should come after `b`.

## Time Complexity

- **Average and Worst Case**: O(n log n) due to the underlying Timsort algorithm used by JavaScript's `sort` method.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the space required for the sorting process in the worst case.

This approach leverages the efficiency and reliability of JavaScript's built-in sort function, providing a clean and straightforward solution to the problem.
