[Leetcode 729. My Calendar I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l729)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a calendar where you can add new events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.)

Your implementation should support the following methods:

- `MyCalendar()`: Initializes the calendar object.
- `boolean book(int start, int end)`: Adds a new event with the given start and end times (both integers). Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking; otherwise, returns `false`.

### Example:
```javascript
MyCalendar calendar = new MyCalendar();
calendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
calendar.book(15, 25); // returns false
calendar.book(20, 30); // returns true
```

### Constraints:
- The number of calls to the `book` method is at most `1000`.
- `0 <= start < end <= 10^9`

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should happen if the start time is equal to the end time?
   - As per usual convention of calendar events, an event with identical start and end times is normally considered invalid.

2. Can I assume that the input times will always be valid integers within the given range?
   - Yes, you can assume the inputs are valid integers and within the specified constraints.

## Strategy

We will maintain a list of tuples to keep track of all scheduled events. When a new event is to be added, we will check for overlaps with any previously booked events. If there is no overlap, we add the event to our list and return `true`. If there is an overlap, we return `false`.

To detect an overlap between two events `(start1, end1)` and `(start2, end2)` the condition to check is:
- `start1 < end2` and `start2 < end1`

This condition ensures we catch any case where the events overlap.

## Code

```javascript
class MyCalendar {
    constructor() {
        this.events = [];
    }
  
    book(start, end) {
        for (let [s, e] of this.events) {
            if (start < e && s < end) {
                // Overlapping condition
                return false;
            }
        }
        this.events.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
}

// Example Usage
let calendar = new MyCalendar();
console.log(calendar.book(10, 20)); // returns true
console.log(calendar.book(15, 25)); // returns false
console.log(calendar.book(20, 30)); // returns true
```

## Time Complexity

- **Constructor**: `O(1)` - Initializing the calendar is a constant-time operation.
- **Book Method**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of events booked so far. In the worst case, we might need to check all previously booked events to detect an overlap.

Given that the number of calls to the `book` method is at most `1000`, this solution should be efficient enough within these constraints.
