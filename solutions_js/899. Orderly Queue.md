[Leetcode 899. Orderly Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l899)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose one of the first `k` letters of `s` and append it at the end of the string.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you could have after applying the mentioned step any number of times.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can we choose the same letter multiple times and move it to the end?
   **A**: Yes, you can choose the same letter as long as it is within the first `k` letters.
   
2. **Q**: What does lexicographically smallest mean?
   **A**: It means the smallest string in dictionary order, e.g., "abc" is smaller than "acb".

3. **Q**: What happens if k=1?
   **A**: You can only rotate the string. The best you can do is find the smallest rotation.

4. **Q**: What happens if k > 1?
   **A**: You can sort the string because you have more flexibility to rearrange the letters.

## Strategy
1. **For `k = 1`**:
   - The best approach is to find the smallest rotation of the string because all rotations are valid by moving one letter at a time from the start to the end.

2. **For `k > 1`**:
   - Simply return the sorted version of the string. With `k > 1`, we are allowed flexibility that makes it possible to achieve any permutation of the string, and sorting will definitely give us the lexicographically smallest result.

## Code
```javascript
function orderlyQueue(s, k) {
    if (k === 1) {
        let minStr = s;
        for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
            const rotatedStr = s.slice(i) + s.slice(0, i);
            if (rotatedStr < minStr) {
                minStr = rotatedStr;
            }
        }
        return minStr;
    } else {
        return s.split('').sort().join('');
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **For `k = 1`**:
  - We check all rotations, where each rotation operation takes O(n). Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.
  
- **For `k > 1`**:
  - We sort the string, which takes O(n log n), where n is the length of the string.

Given the constraints, this solution efficiently handles the problem within reasonable time limits.
