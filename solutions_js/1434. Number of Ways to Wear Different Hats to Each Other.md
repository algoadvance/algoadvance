[Leetcode 1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1434)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` people and an array `hats` where `hats[i]` is a list of all hats preferred by the i-th person. We want to find out how many ways we can distribute different hats to each person such that each person gets exactly one hat and no two persons wear the same hat. Return the number of ways modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Example:
```
Input: hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is exactly one way to assign hats:
- First person gets hat 3 and second person gets hat 4
- Third person gets hat 5
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **How many people and hats can we have?**
   The number of people `n` will be <= 10, the total number of possible hats is 40.
   
2. **Do all people have at least one hat in their preference list?**
   Yes, each person will have at least one hat in their preference list.

3. **What is the range of hat numbers?**
   Hat numbers range from 1 to 40.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, this problem can be approached using dynamic programming with bitmasking:
1. **Bitmask Representation:** 
   - Use a bitmask to represent which people have been assigned a hat.
   - There are at most \(2^{10}\) (1024) states since there are up to 10 people.

2. **DP State Definition:**
   - Let `dp[mask]` be the number of ways to assign hats such that the people represented by the bits in `mask` have been assigned hats.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each hat, update our mask to reflect the assignment of that hat to any person who prefers it.

4. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one way to assign hats when no one has been assigned a hat.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Compute the result for the full bitmask (where all people have been assigned hats).

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be large, take the modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Code

```javascript
var numberWays = function(hats) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = hats.length;
    const allAssigned = (1 << n) - 1;
    
    // Create an array to store people preference list for each hat
    const hatToPeople = Array.from({ length: 41 }, () => []);
    
    // Fill the hatToPeople mapping
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let hat of hats[i]) {
            hatToPeople[hat].push(i);
        }
    }

    // dp array initialized with 0
    const dp = new Array(1 << n).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1; // There's one way to assign hats if nobody needs one
    
    // Iterate over all hats from 1 to 40
    for (let hat = 1; hat <= 40; hat++) {
        // We need to iterate backward to avoid recomputation issues
        for (let mask = allAssigned; mask >= 0; mask--) {
            for (let person of hatToPeople[hat]) {
                // Check if person is already included in current state
                if ((mask & (1 << person)) === 0) {
                    dp[mask | (1 << person)] = (dp[mask | (1 << person)] + dp[mask]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the number of ways to assign hats for the full mask
    return dp[allAssigned];
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization:** \(O(n \times m)\), where `n` is the number of people, and `m` is the hat list size.
2. **Main loop:** \(O(40 \times 2^n \times n)\), since we have 40 hats, `2^n` possible states for n people, and for each state, we iterate through possible people to wear the hat.
3. **Overall Complexity:** \(O(40 \times 2^n \times n)\), which is feasible given `n <= 10`.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and should work within competitive programming limits.
