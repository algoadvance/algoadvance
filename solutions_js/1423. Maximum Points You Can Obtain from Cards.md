[Leetcode 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1423)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `cardPoints` where `cardPoints[i]` is the number of points you get from the `i-th` card. You can take cards from the beginning or from the end of the array to maximize the total points you obtain in `k` moves.

Return the maximum score you can obtain by taking exactly `k` cards.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the number of cards and the number of `k` moves?
2. Can the value of `k` be greater than the length of the cards array?
3. Do the values in the `cardPoints` array contain any negative numbers or are they all non-negative?

Based on standard problem specifications:
1. The number of cards, `n`, and the number of moves, `k`, are typically such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`.
2. `k` will not be greater than the length of the array since we're taking exactly `k` cards.
3. The values in the `cardPoints` array are non-negative integers.

### Strategy
Instead of directly considering `k` cards from either end in a brute force way, which would be inefficient, we can use a sliding window strategy to find the optimal subarray of size `n-k` (the size of the subarray we should leave out).

1. Calculate the total sum of the entire `cardPoints` array.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum sum of any subarray of length `n-k`.
3. Use a sliding window of size `n-k` to find this minimum sum.
4. The result will be the total sum of the array minus this minimum subarray sum.

### Code

```javascript
function maxScore(cardPoints, k) {
    const n = cardPoints.length;
    const totalSum = cardPoints.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);

    if (k === n) return totalSum;

    // Calculate initial sum of the first (n-k) elements
    let windowSum = 0;
    let minSubarraySum;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
        windowSum += cardPoints[i];
    }
    minSubarraySum = windowSum;

    // Slide the window from left to right over the array
    for (let i = n - k; i < n; i++) {
        windowSum += cardPoints[i] - cardPoints[i - (n - k)];
        minSubarraySum = Math.min(minSubarraySum, windowSum);
    }

    // Maximum score is total sum minus the minimum subarray sum
    return totalSum - minSubarraySum;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in linear time `O(n)`:
- Calculating the total sum takes `O(n)`.
- Finding the minimum subarray sum using the sliding window technique takes `O(n)`.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently find the maximum score obtainable by taking exactly `k` cards.
