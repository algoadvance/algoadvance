[Leetcode 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l395)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of `s` such that the frequency of each character in this substring is at least `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Can the input string `s` contain uppercase letters, special characters, or is it limited to lowercase letters?
   - The input `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - Constraints: `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`

3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases we need to handle?
   - Edge cases to consider:
     - If `s` is an empty string, the output should be 0.
     - If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, the output should be 0 since no substring can meet the requirement.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a divide and conquer approach combined with recursion:

1. We will split the string at points where the characters appear less than `k` times since they cannot be part of any valid substring satisfying the condition.
2. For each segment, we will recursively apply the same logic to find the longest valid substring.

### Code

```javascript
var longestSubstring = function(s, k) {
    // Base case: if the string length is less than k, return 0
    if (s.length < k) return 0;

    // Frequency map to count occurrences of each character
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (let char of s) {
        freqMap.set(char, (freqMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Find the first character with frequency < k
    let splitPoint = 0;
    while (splitPoint < s.length && freqMap.get(s[splitPoint]) >= k) {
        splitPoint++;
    }

    // If no such character exists, the whole string is valid
    if (splitPoint === s.length) return s.length;

    // Recursively solve for the segments divided by the split point
    const left = longestSubstring(s.slice(0, splitPoint), k);

    // Skip all the characters that can't be part of any valid substring.
    while (splitPoint < s.length && freqMap.get(s[splitPoint]) < k) {
        splitPoint++;
    }

    const right = longestSubstring(s.slice(splitPoint), k);

    // Return the maximum length from both left and right
    return Math.max(left, right);
};
```

### Time Complexity
- Let \( n \) be the length of the string `s`.
- The time complexity of finding the frequency of characters is \( O(n) \).
- The worst-case scenario involves recursively processing the string at every character, which would yield a complexity of \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case.
- However, the split usually happens in chunks, making the typical performance better.


### Example Walkthrough

```javascript
// Example 1:
let s = "aaabb";
let k = 3;
console.log(longestSubstring(s, k)); // Output: 3 (The substring "aaa" is valid)

// Example 2:
s = "ababbc";
k = 2;
console.log(longestSubstring(s, k)); // Output: 5 (The substring "ababb" or "babab" is valid)
```

The function first constructs a frequency map and then recursively divides and conquers the string around characters that cannot contribute to valid substrings. By comparing results from the left and right segments, it determines the maximum length of valid substrings.
