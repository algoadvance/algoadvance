### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2073: Time Needed to Buy Tickets

You are given an array `tickets` where `tickets[i]` represents the number of tickets that the `i-th` person wants. The `i-th` person is standing in a queue. Each person in the queue takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can buy only one ticket at a time and has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) after buying a ticket.

If a person does not have any ticket left to buy, they leave the queue.

Return the time taken for the person in position `k` (0-indexed) to finish buying all their tickets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Order of Queue**: Does the queue order remain constant except when someone buys a ticket and goes to the end, or exactly follows the process described?
    - Yes, the order remains constant; people queue back in their original place until they have no more tickets to buy.
    
2. **Per Ticket Time**: Does each ticket take exactly 1 second no matter what?
    - Yes, every ticket purchase takes exactly 1 second.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Queue**: Each person buys one ticket at a time in a circular manner.
2. **Focus on the `k-th` Person**: We need to keep a track of the total time taken and also check specifically for when the `k-th` person buys their last ticket.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} tickets
 * @param {number} k 
 * @return {number}
 */
function timeRequiredToBuy(tickets, k) {
    let time = 0;
    let n = tickets.length;
    
    while (tickets[k] > 0) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (tickets[i] > 0) {
                tickets[i]--;
                time++;
            }
            if (tickets[k] === 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return time;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Time Initialization**: Initialize `time` to 0, to start counting the seconds required.
2. **Loop Over Queue**: Use a `while` loop to keep running until the `k-th` person has bought all their tickets (i.e., `tickets[k]` becomes zero).
3. **Iterate and Decrement**: Use a `for` loop to iterate over the queue:
   - Check if the person at the current index has tickets left. If so, decrement their ticket count by 1 and increment the time.
   - Check if the `k-th` person’s tickets have reached zero to break out of the loop early if needed.

### Time Complexity

- **Loop Execution**: The outer `while` loop runs until the `k-th` person’s tickets are zero, and the inner `for` loop runs for each person.
- **Maximum Operations**: In the worst case, each person buys their tickets fully in n cycles.
- **Total Complexity**: `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the position in the queue and `n` is the number of people, considering that every individual might take as long as `k` times iterating through the queue to finish their purchase.

This implementation ensures that we correctly simulate the ticket-buying process in a way that fits the problem constraints and returns the valid time required for the `k-th` person to finish buying their tickets.
