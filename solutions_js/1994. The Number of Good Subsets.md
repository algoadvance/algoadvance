[Leetcode 1994. The Number of Good Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1994)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` a "good" subset if the product of its elements is a positive integer that can be expressed as a product of distinct prime numbers.

Return the number of different good subsets of `nums` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subset of `nums` can include elements with repetitions, as long as the corresponding product can be uniquely represented as a product of distinct prime numbers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - The size of the array can range from 1 to 1000.

2. **What is the range of values in the `nums` array?**
   - The array values can range from 1 to 30.

3. **Should we consider the order of elements in subsets?**
   - No, the order in subsets does not matter.

With this understanding, we can move to the solution strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Prime Factor Identification:**
   - The problem involves identifying numbers that can be expressed as a product of distinct primes. We will first identify all prime numbers up to 30, which are `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}`.

2. **Map Valid Numbers to Prime Factors:**
   - We'll create a bitmask for each number representing which prime numbers are factors of that number.

3. **Count Valid Subsets:**
   - Use dynamic programming to count the number of "good" subsets. The state will be represented by the bitmask of primes.

4. **Optimization:**
   - We use a map to store the counts of valid products.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `nums` contains a very high frequency of non-trivial numbers, we need to ensure our solution is optimized.

### Code

Here's the solution step-by-step in JavaScript:

```javascript
function numberOfGoodSubsets(nums) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29];
    const primeMasks = {};
    
    function getPrimeMask(num) {
        if (primeMasks.hasOwnProperty(num)) {
            return primeMasks[num];
        }
        let mask = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < primes.length; i++) {
            let prime = primes[i];
            if (num % (prime * prime) === 0) {
                return -1; // num has a squared prime factor, not valid
            }
            if (num % prime === 0) {
                mask |= (1 << i);
            }
        }
        primeMasks[num] = mask;
        return mask;
    }
    
    const count = new Array(31).fill(0);
    for (const num of nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }
    
    const dp = new Array(1 << primes.length).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    for (let num = 2; num <= 30; num++) {
        if (count[num] === 0) continue;
        const primeMask = getPrimeMask(num);
        if (primeMask === -1) continue;

        for (let state = (1 << primes.length) - 1; state >= 0; state--) {
            if ((state & primeMask) === 0) {
                dp[state | primeMask] = (dp[state | primeMask] + dp[state] * count[num]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let state = 1; state < (1 << primes.length); state++) {
        result = (result + dp[state]) % MOD;
    }

    let onesPow = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < count[1]; i++) {
        onesPow = (onesPow * 2) % MOD;
    }

    return (result * onesPow) % MOD;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution runs in \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array (up to 1000) and \(k\) (which is 10) represents the handling of bitmasks for primes.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(2^k)\) for storing the dynamic programming states, plus the additional space for counts and prime masks which is \(O(31)\).

This approach ensures we efficiently count the good subsets by leveraging bit manipulation and dynamic programming.
