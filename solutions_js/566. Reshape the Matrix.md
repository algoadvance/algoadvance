[Leetcode 566. Reshape the Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l566)
### Problem Statement

You are given an m x n matrix `mat` and two integers `r` and `c` representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]
```

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 2, c = 4
Output: [[1,2], [3,4]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are m and n always positive integers?**
   - Yes, `m` and `n` are always positive.

2. **Can the reshaped matrix have negative dimensions?**
   - No, `r` and `c` will always be positive integers.

3. **Should we handle non-integer elements in the matrix?**
   - No, you can assume that the elements of the matrix are all integers.

4. **Should we consider the possibility of an empty matrix?**
   - Yes, you can assume that valid inputs are provided where `mat` is not empty.

### Strategy

1. **Input Validation**: First, check whether the reshape operation is possible. This requires:
   - If `m * n` (total number of elements in the original matrix) is not equal to `r * c`, return the original matrix since reshaping is not possible.

2. **Flatten the Original Matrix**: Convert the 2D matrix into a 1D list so we can easily iterate and reshape it.

3. **Construct the New Matrix**: Use the elements from the flattened list to construct the new `r x c` matrix.

### Code

Let's implement the strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function matrixReshape(mat, r, c) {
    const m = mat.length;
    const n = mat[0].length;

    // Check if reshaping is possible
    if (m * n !== r * c) {
        return mat;
    }

    // Flatten the original matrix
    const flat = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            flat.push(mat[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Construct the new reshaped matrix
    const reshapedMat = [];
    let index = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        const newRow = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < c; j++) {
            newRow.push(flat[index]);
            index++;
        }
        reshapedMat.push(newRow);
    }

    return reshapedMat;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Flatten Matrix Operation**: O(m * n)
  - We traverse each element once.
- **Construct New Matrix**: O(r * c)
  - Again, each element is traversed once.

Given that `m * n = r * c`, it simplifies to:
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(m * n)

Space Complexity:
- **Auxiliary Space for Flattened Array**: O(m * n)
- **Auxiliary Space for Reshaped Matrix**: O(r * c) which is also O(m * n)

So, the space complexity remains O(m * n).
