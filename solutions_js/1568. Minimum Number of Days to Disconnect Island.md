[Leetcode 1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1568)
### Problem Statement:
Given a 2D grid consisting of `0`s and `1`s, where `1` represents land and `0` represents water, we need to determine the minimum number of days required to disconnect the island. An island is considered disconnected if it is split into more than one island or there is no land remaining.

You can perform one of the following operations per day:
- Change any single `1` to a `0`.

Find the minimum number of days required to disconnect the island.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can we assume that there is only one island in the grid initially?**  
   - Yes, we can assume that the given grid represents a single connected island initially.

2. **Is grid size limited or very large?**
   - For practical purposes assume the grid size to be within typical constraints defined by Leetcode, usually around 30x30.

3. **Are there multiple possible solutions or configurations that need to be considered simultaneously?**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of days, which implies finding the most efficient solution.

### Code:
Let's move on to the solution. We'll use depth-first search (DFS) to determine if the grid is connected or not, and simulate the disconnection process.

### Strategy:
1. **Check if initial grid is already disconnected:**
   - If the grid is already disconnected, return `0`.

2. **Try changing each land cell (1) to water (0):**
   - For each cell with `1`, temporarily change it to `0` and check if this disconnection splits the island.
   - If any single change results in disconnection, return `1`.

3. **Try two-step disconnection if needed:**
   - For any valid configuration not captured in step 2, changing two `1`s to `0` should always result in disconnection.
   - We simulate this by first toggling one land cell and then checking all possible toggles for the second cell.

### Time Complexity:
- Each DFS traversal takes `O(N * M)` where `N` is the number of rows and `M` is the number of columns.
- Testing each `1` cell individually involves another similar traversal.
- This gives us a time complexity, for the worst case, approximately `O(N * M * (number of 1s))`.

```javascript
const minDays = (grid) => {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    const directions = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]];

    const inBounds = (r, c) => r >= 0 && r < rows && c >= 0 && c < cols;

    const dfs = (r, c, visited) => {
        const stack = [[r, c]];
        while (stack.length) {
            const [cr, cc] = stack.pop();
            for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
                const nr = cr + dr;
                const nc = cc + dc;
                if (inBounds(nr, nc) && grid[nr][nc] === 1 && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                    visited[nr][nc] = true;
                    stack.push([nr, nc]);
                }
            }
        }
    };

    const isDisconnected = () => {
        const visited = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(false));
        let components = 0;
        for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] === 1 && !visited[r][c]) {
                    if (components > 0) return true;
                    visited[r][c] = true;
                    dfs(r, c, visited);
                    components++;
                }
            }
        }
        return components === 0;
    };

    if (isDisconnected()) return 0;

    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
                grid[r][c] = 0;
                if (isDisconnected()) return 1;
                grid[r][c] = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return 2;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is `O(R * C * (R * C))` in the worst case, where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns. This encompasses iterating over each cell and performing the DFS.

This approach is efficient for typical problem constraints and ensures we find the minimum number of days required to disconnect the island.
