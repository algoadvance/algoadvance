[Leetcode 3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3195)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D binary grid containing only '0's and '1's. Find the minimum area rectangle that can enclose all of the '1's. The sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the coordinate axes.

Example:
```
Input: grid = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
]
Output: 12
Explanation: The rectangle enclosing all the '1's has top-left corner at (0, 0) and bottom-right corner at (3, 2).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the grid be of any size?
   **A:** Yes, the grid can be of any size, but it will be a rectangular 2D grid.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the grid?
   **A:** The problem typically doesnâ€™t specify size constraints, but let's assume grid dimensions are reasonably constrained by practical limits (e.g., up to 1000x1000).

3. **Q:** Can the grid contain only '0's? If so, what should be the output?
   **A:** Yes, in such a case, the output should be `0` because there are no '1's to form a rectangle.

4. **Q:** Will there be at least one '1' in the grid?
   **A:** No, the grid can be entirely composed of '0's.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll go through the grid to find the minimum bounding box that covers all '1's. We need to determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain a '1'. The area can then be calculated using these bounds.

### Steps

1. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum rows and columns.
2. Traverse the grid to update these variables whenever a '1' is encountered.
3. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the identified bounds.

### Code

```javascript
function minArea(grid) {
    if (!grid || grid.length === 0 || grid[0].length === 0) return 0;
    
    let minX = Infinity, minY = Infinity;
    let maxX = -Infinity, maxY = -Infinity;
    
    const numRows = grid.length;
    const numCols = grid[0].length;
    
    // Traverse the grid to find min and max coordinates
    for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < numCols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                minX = Math.min(minX, i);
                minY = Math.min(minY, j);
                maxX = Math.max(maxX, i);
                maxY = Math.max(maxY, j);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If no '1' is found, return 0
    if (minX === Infinity) return 0;
    
    // Calculate the area of the rectangle
    let width = maxY - minY + 1;
    let height = maxX - minX + 1;
    
    return width * height;
}

// Example usage
const grid = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
];

console.log(minArea(grid)); // Output: 12
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(N * M)`, where `N` is the number of rows and `M` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we traverse the entire grid exactly once.

The space complexity is `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of extra space for storing our min and max values.
