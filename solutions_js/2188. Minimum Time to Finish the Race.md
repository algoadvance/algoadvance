[Leetcode 2188. Minimum Time to Finish the Race](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2188)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays: `tires` and `changeTime`, and an integer `numLaps`. 

- `tires[i] = [fi, ri]` indicates that the ith tire takes `fi` seconds to finish the first lap and the lap time increases by a factor of `ri` with every subsequent lap.
- `changeTime` is the time in seconds you need to change tires.

Your task is to find the minimum time to finish `numLaps` laps given that you can replace the tires as many times as you want.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the number of elements in `tires` and the values of `fi`, `ri`, and `changeTime`?
2. Is there any limit on the number of times we can change tires?
3. Would you prefer a detailed breakdown of the logic, or should I provide optimized code directly?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to think about it dynamically:

1. **Model Each Tire's Performance Over Time**:
    - Compute the lap times for using each tire consecutively until the time it makes sense to switch them due to excessive increase.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
    - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum time to finish `i` laps.
    - Initialize `dp[0]` to 0.
    - Iterate from lap 1 to `numLaps` and for each lap, determine the minimum time by either continuing on the same tire or switching to a new set.

3. **Optimize the DP Calculations**:
    - Precompute the minimum time to run `k` consecutive laps for each tire for a reasonable number of laps before it becomes too slow.
    - Use these precomputed values to populate the DP table efficiently.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function minimumFinishTime(tires, changeTime, numLaps) {
    const maxLapsOnOneTire = 20; // Arbitrarily large to ensure performance doesn't degrade too much.
    const inf = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;

    // Precompute lap times for each tire
    const minTimeForLaps = Array.from({ length: tires.length }, () => Array(maxLapsOnOneTire + 1).fill(inf));
    for (let i = 0; i < tires.length; i++) {
        let [f, r] = tires[i];
        let time = f;
        let total = 0;
        for (let j = 1; j <= maxLapsOnOneTire && total < inf; j++) {
            total += time;
            minTimeForLaps[i][j] = total;
            time *= r;
        }
    }

    // Dynamic Programming to find minimum time for numLaps
    const dp = Array(numLaps + 1).fill(inf);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= numLaps; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= Math.min(i, maxLapsOnOneTire); j++) {
            for (let k = 0; k < tires.length; k++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - j] + minTimeForLaps[k][j] + (i !== j ? changeTime : 0));
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[numLaps];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pre-computation:** `O(t * L)` where `t` is the number of tires and `L` is the maximum laps we consider per tire.
- **DP Calculation:** `O(numLaps * L * t)` which can be significant but feasible given the constraints.

### Explanation

1. **Precompute Lap Times:**
   - We compute how long it would take each tire to run from 1 up to `maxLapsOnOneTire` consecutive laps.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - Initialize `dp` array to store the minimum time to finish each number of laps.
   - Iterate through each lap count `i`, and for each possible consecutive lap count `j`, update the DP table by considering all tire options and whether to change tires or not.

This approach ensures we evaluate the optimal tire change strategy without redundantly calculating each possible path exhaustively.
