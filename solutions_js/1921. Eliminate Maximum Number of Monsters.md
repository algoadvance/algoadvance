[Leetcode 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1921)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a horde of monsters. The city is represented as a point on a line, and the monsters are approaching the city from the right side, represented as distances in an array. Each turn, a monster moves one unit closer to the city. You have a gun that can eliminate one monster per turn before any of the monsters move. Return the maximum number of monsters you can eliminate before any of them reach the city.

#### Example:
- **Input:** `dist = [1, 3, 4]`, `speed = [1, 1, 1]`
- **Output:** `3`
  
#### Constraints:
- `1 <= dist.length == speed.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in the `dist` and `speed` arrays positive integers?**
   - Yes, all distances and speeds are positive integers.
2. **If two monsters reach the city at the same turn, how do we handle it?**
   - In such a case, you can only eliminate one of the two. We should prioritize the one with the sooner arrival time.
3. **Are the `dist` and `speed` inputs guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, as per the problem constraints, both arrays will always have the same length.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Time to Reach City:**
   - For each monster, calculate the time it will take to reach the city using the formula `time = Math.ceil(dist[i] / speed[i])`. Since both are positive integers and we are doing integer math, this simplifies to `time = Math.floor(dist[i] / speed[i])`.
   
2. **Sort Times:**
   - After calculating the time for each monster, sort these times.

3. **Eliminate Monsters:**
   - Starting from the monster that arrives the soonest, attempt to eliminate as many as possible one per turn. Count each eliminated monster until you can no longer eliminate any before they reach the city.

### Code

```javascript
var eliminateMaximum = function(dist, speed) {
    const n = dist.length;
    let times = new Array(n);
    
    // Calculate the time each monster takes to reach the city
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        times[i] = Math.ceil(dist[i] / speed[i]);
    }
    
    // Sort times
    times.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Start eliminating monsters
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i >= times[i]) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    
    return n;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Calculation:** \( O(n) \), for calculating the reach time for each monster.
- **Sorting:** \( O(n \log n) \), for sorting the times.
- **Elimination:** \( O(n) \), for checking each monster in turn.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \( O(n \log n) \).

This solution is efficient and works within the given constraints.
