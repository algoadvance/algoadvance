[Leetcode 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1448)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree, where each node contains an integer value. A node is considered a "good" node if, in the path from the root to that node, there are no values greater than the node's value.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the number of good nodes.

### Example 1
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good. 
```

### Example 2
```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good. 
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the value of a node in case the root itself is undefined? 
   - If the root is undefined, then the tree is empty and the count should be 0.
2. Are all nodes' values distinct?
   - No, nodes' values are not necessarily distinct.

## Strategy
1. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to traverse the tree.
2. While traversing, we keep track of the maximum value encountered on the path from the root to the current node.
3. For each node, if its value is greater than or equal to this maximum value, it is considered a good node.
4. We update the maximum value accordingly as we recurse through the tree.
5. Using a helper function, we can count the number of good nodes and return the result.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

var goodNodes = function(root) {
    let result = 0;
    
    const dfs = (node, maxSoFar) => {
        if (!node) return;
        
        // If the current node is a good node
        if (node.val >= maxSoFar) {
            result++;
        }
        
        // Update the maxSoFar for the child's path
        const newMax = Math.max(maxSoFar, node.val);
        
        // Traverse the left and right subtrees
        dfs(node.left, newMax);
        dfs(node.right, newMax);
    }
    
    // Start DFS with the root node and its value as the initial max
    dfs(root, root.val);
    
    return result;
};

// Example use
let root = new TreeNode(3, 
    new TreeNode(1, 
        new TreeNode(3), 
        null
    ), 
    new TreeNode(4, 
        new TreeNode(1), 
        new TreeNode(5)
    )
);

console.log(goodNodes(root)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is the space used by the call stack during the DFS, which can go as deep as the height of the tree. In the worst case, this will be O(n) for a skewed tree.
