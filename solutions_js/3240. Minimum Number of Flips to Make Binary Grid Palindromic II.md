[Leetcode 3240. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3240)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary grid of size `m x n` consisting only of `0`s and `1`s. You can perform two types of operations on the grid:

1. **Flip a specific cell**: Change the value of the cell from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.
2. **Flip an entire row or column**: Change all the `0`s to `1`s and all the `1`s to `0`s in that row or column.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the grid palindromic. A binary grid is considered palindromic if it reads the same when flipped horizontally or vertically.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on grid size?**
   - The grid size `m x n` can be reasonably assumed to fit in typical constraints for coding problems (e.g., \(1 \leq m, n \leq 50\)).

2. **How do horizontal and vertical flips work?**
   - A horizontal flip involves reversing the rows, and a vertical flip involves reversing the columns.

3. **Are there any preconditions for what constitutes an initial palindromic state?**
   - A grid is already palindromic if the rows/columns match their respective reversals.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Palindromic Constraints**:
    - For a grid to be horizontally palindromic, each row must read the same forwards and backwards.
    - For a grid to be vertically palindromic, each column must read the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
    - Utilize dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum number of operations required to make the grid palindromic.
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` denotes the minimal number of operations required to make the subgrid defined from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)` palindromic.

3. **Counting Cost of Operations**:
    - Count the cost of flipping cells individually vs. flipping rows/columns.
    - Dynamic flipping can be efficiently applied to minimize operations.

Hereâ€™s an example implementation in JavaScript:

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var minFlips = function(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
  
    // Make the grid palindrome by considering cells and their reflections
    let flips = 0;

    // Helper function to count mismatches
    function countMismatches(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
        return grid[x1][y1] !== grid[x2][y2] ? 1 : 0;
    }
  
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(m / 2); ++i) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            // Current cell and its vertical reflection
            flips += countMismatches(i, j, m - 1 - i, j);
        }
    }
  
    for (let j = 0; j < Math.floor(n / 2); ++j) {
        for (let i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            // Current cell and its horizontal reflection
            flips += countMismatches(i, j, i, n - 1 - j);
        }
    }
  
    // This assumes optimal case calculations in O(m*n)
    return flips;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above approach is \(O(m \times n)\) because it requires iterating through each cell `(i, j)` and its corresponding reflections in the grid to calculate mismatch and possible flips.

This ensures that even for the upper edge case size, the function remains efficient and manageable within competitive coding constraints.
