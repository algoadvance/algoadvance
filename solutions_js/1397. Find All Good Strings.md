[Leetcode 1397. Find All Good Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1397)
## Problem Statement

Given the strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, and a string `evil`. A string is considered "good" if it doesn't contain the string `evil` as a substring. We need to count all the good strings that are lexicographically between `s1` and `s2` inclusive.

Since the result could be large, we should return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Input:
- `s1, s2, evil`: Three strings of the same length `n`.

### Output:
- An integer representing the count of all good strings between `s1` and `s2` inclusive.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of strings s1, s2, and evil?**
    - s1, s2, and evil are non-empty strings of the same length `n`.

2. **What characters can the input strings contain?**
    - The strings contain lowercase English letters only ('a' to 'z').

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - This problem can be reduced to a dynamic programming problem with states defined by the length of the string, whether it is still "tight" compared to `s1` and `s2`, and the current matching length of the `evil` string.

2. **Three States**:
    - `pos`: Current position in the string being constructed.
    - `prefix1`: Boolean indicating if the current string is still a prefix of `s1`.
    - `prefix2`: Boolean indicating if the current string is still a prefix of `s2`.
    - `e`: Current match length with the `evil` prefix.

3. **Transition**:
    - For each position, we can use any character from 'a' to 'z', and update the state accordingly. If using the character causes the `evil` prefix to be matched, this path is invalid.

4. **Memoization**:
    - Memoize the results of the states to avoid recomputation.

5. **KMP Algorithm**:
    - Use KMP failure function to compute the next state of matching the `evil` string when a character is added.

## Code
```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function findAllGoodStrings(n, s1, s2, evil) {
    // Failure function for KMP algorithm
    const kmp = new Array(evil.length).fill(0);
    for (let i = 1, j = 0; i < evil.length; ++i) {
        if (evil[i] === evil[j]) {
            kmp[i] = ++j;
        } else if (j > 0) {
            j = kmp[j - 1];
            --i;  // Since the outer loop will increment i
        }
    }

    const dp = new Map();

    function dfs(pos, prefix1, prefix2, e) {
        if (e === evil.length) return 0;  // Contain `evil`
        if (pos === n) return 1;  // A good string

        const key = `${pos}-${prefix1}-${prefix2}-${e}`;
        if (dp.has(key)) return dp.get(key);

        let low = prefix1 ? s1[pos] : 'a';
        let high = prefix2 ? s2[pos] : 'z';

        let count = 0;
        for (let ch = low.charCodeAt(0); ch <= high.charCodeAt(0); ++ch) {
            const c = String.fromCharCode(ch);
            let nextE = e;
            while (nextE > 0 && evil[nextE] !== c) {
                nextE = kmp[nextE - 1];
            }
            if (evil[nextE] === c) nextE++;
            count = (count + dfs(
                pos + 1,
                prefix1 && c === s1[pos],
                prefix2 && c === s2[pos],
                nextE
            )) % MOD;
        }

        dp.set(key, count);
        return count;
    }

    return dfs(0, true, true, 0);
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * |evil| * 26) = O(n^2 * 26) in the worst case where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * |evil|) for memoization storage.

This solution ensures an efficient way to count the number of good strings without brute-forcing through every possible string between `s1` and `s2`. The use of prefix conditions and the KMP algorithm helps in skipping invalid paths efficiently.
