[Leetcode 224. Basic Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l224)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` representing a basic mathematical expression that includes `(`, `)`, `+`, `-`, and non-negative integers, evaluate the expression and return its value. Note that:
- The input string is guaranteed to be valid.
- There will be no division or multiplication.
- The integer division should truncate toward zero; the result will always be an integer.
- You can assume that the only operations are addition, subtraction, parentheses, and non-negative integers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input string contain spaces?**
   - Yes, the input string can contain spaces that need to be ignored.

2. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - Constraints aren't given explicitly here, but we assume it's up to the typical constraints LeetCode uses, such as a few thousand characters.

3. **Are there any invalid characters or malformed expressions?**
   - No, the problem statement guarantees the input string is valid.

4. **Are there any leading zeros in the numbers?**
   - Typically, well-formed numbers would not have leading zeros, but this might need handling to ensure proper integer conversion.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll iterate through the string and use a stack to handle the nested parentheses and signs. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Set up a stack to manage nested expressions. Initialize variables to keep track of the current number (`num`), the result (`result`), and the current sign (`sign`).
2. **Iterate through the string**:
    - **Digit**: Build the current number.
    - **Operator ('+' or '-')**: Update the result with the current number and reset the current number; update the sign.
    - **Left Parenthesis ('(')**: Push the result and the sign onto the stack, reset the result and sign.
    - **Right Parenthesis (')')**: Compute the result within the parenthesis and combine with the result outside the parenthesis.
3. **Post-Iteration Cleanup**: Make sure to add any remaining number to the result.

### Code

```javascript
function calculate(s) {
    let stack = [];
    let num = 0;
    let result = 0;
    let sign = 1;  // 1 means positive, -1 means negative

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let ch = s[i];

        if (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9') {
            num = num * 10 + (ch - '0');  // Build the number
        } else if (ch === '+') {
            result += sign * num;  // Add the previous number with its sign
            sign = 1;  // Reset sign to positive
            num = 0;  // Reset number
        } else if (ch === '-') {
            result += sign * num;  // Add the previous number with its sign
            sign = -1;  // Reset sign to negative
            num = 0;  // Reset number
        } else if (ch === '(') {
            // Push the current result and sign onto the stack
            stack.push(result);
            stack.push(sign);
            // Reset for the new sub-expression
            result = 0;
            sign = 1;
        } else if (ch === ')') {
            result += sign * num;  // Add the previous number with its sign
            num = 0;  // Reset number
            result *= stack.pop();  // stack.pop() is the sign before the parenthesis
            result += stack.pop();  // stack.pop() now is the result calculated so far
        }
    }
    // Add the last number calculated to the result
    result += sign * num;
    return result;
}

// Example usage
console.log(calculate("1 + 1")); // Output: 2
console.log(calculate(" 2-1 + 2 ")); // Output: 3
console.log(calculate("(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)")); // Output: 23
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we process each character in the string exactly once.
- Space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case due to the use of the stack to handle nested expressions.

With this strategy and code, you can handle nested expressions and evaluate the given mathematical expression correctly.
