[Leetcode 72. Edit Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l72)
## Problem Statement

Given two words `word1` and `word2`, find the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

This is a classic problem known as the "Edit Distance" problem.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `word1` and `word2`?
     - You can assume the length of both words to be â‰¤ 500.

2. **Operation Costs:**
   - Are all three operations (insert, delete, replace) considered to have the same cost?
     - Yes, each operation counts as one step.

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
     - Yes, treat uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to build a solution based on subproblems. The idea is to create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`.

### Steps to Fill the DP Table

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][j]` for all `j`: converting an empty string to first `j` characters of `word2` needs `j` insertions.
   - `dp[i][0]` for all `i`: converting the first `i` characters of `word1` to an empty string needs `i` deletions.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` (no operation needed).
   - Otherwise, consider the minimum of:
     - `dp[i-1][j] + 1`: Delete operation
     - `dp[i][j-1] + 1`: Insert operation
     - `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`: Replace operation

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. This is due to the nested loops required to fill the `dp` table.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage required for the `dp` table.

## Code

```javascript
function minDistance(word1, word2) {
    const m = word1.length;
    const n = word2.length;

    // Initialize the DP table
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    // Fill the base cases
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = i;
    }

    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = j;
    }

    // Fill the DP table
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1,   // Delete
                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1,   // Insert
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 // Replace
                );
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}
```

This code will compute the minimum edit distance between two given words using the described DP approach.
