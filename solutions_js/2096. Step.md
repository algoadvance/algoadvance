### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes, and each node is uniquely valued. You are also given the values `startValue` and `destValue`. Find the **shortest path** from the node with `startValue` to the node with `destValue` in the binary tree.

The path should be represented as a string consisting of the characters 'L' (left), 'R' (right), and 'U' (up), representing steps to the left child, right child, and parent node, respectively.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the given binary tree always be a valid binary tree?**
    - Yes, the binary tree will be valid and well-formed.
2. **Can `startValue` and `destValue` be the same?**
    - No, `startValue` and `destValue` will be distinct.
3. **Can the binary tree have duplicate values?**
    - No, all node values are unique.
4. **Will the `startValue` and `destValue` always be present in the tree?**
    - Yes, both `startValue` and `destValue` are guaranteed to be present.

### Strategy

1. **Find common ancestor:**
   - First, locate the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the nodes with `startValue` and `destValue`. The LCA will help identify the split point in the tree from which the paths to `startValue` and `destValue` diverge.

2. **Calculate directions:**
   - From the LCA, compute the path to `startValue` and convert it into "U" (up) steps.
   - From the LCA, compute the path to `destValue` and convert it to "L" and "R" (left and right) steps.

3. **Combine paths:**
   - Combine the paths calculated in the previous step to get the final direction sequence.

### Code
```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

// Function to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
function findLCA(root, p, q) {
    if (root === null || root.val === p || root.val === q) {
        return root;
    }

    const left = findLCA(root.left, p, q);
    const right = findLCA(root.right, p, q);

    if (left !== null && right !== null) {
        return root;
    }

    return left !== null ? left : right;
}

function getPath(root, target) {
    if (root === null) return null;
    if (root.val === target) return "";

    const leftPath = getPath(root.left, target);
    if (leftPath !== null) {
        return 'L' + leftPath;
    }

    const rightPath = getPath(root.right, target);
    if (rightPath !== null) {
        return 'R' + rightPath;
    }

    return null;
}

var getDirections = function(root, startValue, destValue) {
    // Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of startValue and destValue
    const lca = findLCA(root, startValue, destValue);

    // Get the path from LCA to startValue
    const pathToStart = getPath(lca, startValue);

    // Get the path from LCA to destValue
    const pathToDest = getPath(lca, destValue);

    // Combine both paths: Convert pathToStart to 'U's and append pathToDest
    const stepsUp = 'U'.repeat(pathToStart.length);
    return stepsUp + pathToDest;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding LCA:** The `findLCA` function may potentially visit every node once. This gives it a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Finding paths:** The `getPath` function also may visit many nodes, but since it usually terminates earlier, it will be logarithmic in balanced trees. However, in the worst-case scenario, it may need to visit every node, making this O(n).
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

This approach should efficiently solve the problem within acceptable constraints.
