[Leetcode 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1018)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of 0s and 1s, consider `N_i` to be the i-th binary number formed just by A[0] to A[i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit). Return a list of booleans `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if `N_i` is divisible by 5.

### Example
- Input: `A = [0, 1, 1]`
- Output: `[true, false, false]`
- Explanation:
  - `. N_0 = 0 -> 0 % 5 == 0 -> true`
  - `. N_1 = 01 -> 1 % 5 != 0 -> false`
  - `. N_2 = 011 -> 3 % 5 != 0 -> false`

### Example 2
- Input: `A = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]`
- Output: `[false, false, false, false, true]`

Solution must consider the constraints:
- `1 <= A.length <= 30000`
- `A[i]` is `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the solution deal with excessively large binary numbers directly? 
   - The solution should account for the size of numbers efficiently, since A can be quite long.
2. Is performance an issue we need to account for due to input constraints?
   - Yes, the solution should handle the maximum constraint efficiently.
3. Should we always return an array of booleans matching the size of input A?
   - Yes, we expect the output array to be of the same length as the input array.

## Strategy

Instead of converting the binary values to decimal directly (which can get very large), we can keep track of the remainders when divided by 5. Using properties of remainders:
- `(a * 2 + b) % c == ((a % c) * 2 + b % c) % c`

### Steps:
1. Initialize `current_number` to 0.
2. Traverse through the array `A`, updating `current_number` using `current_number = (current_number * 2 + A[i]) % 5`.
3. Append `true` to the answer array if `current_number` is 0, otherwise append `false`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
var prefixesDivBy5 = function (A) {
    let current_number = 0;
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        current_number = (current_number * 2 + A[i]) % 5;
        result.push(current_number === 0);
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
// console.log(prefixesDivBy5([0, 1, 1])); // Output: [true, false, false]
// console.log(prefixesDivBy5([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])); // Output: [false, false, false, false, true]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array `A`. This is because we are performing a constant amount of work for each element in `A`.

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the output array `result`.
