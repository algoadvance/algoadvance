[Leetcode 2744. Find Maximum Number of String Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2744)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each string in the array consists of two lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum number of pairs of strings such that each pair contains the same characters but in reversed order.

### Example:
```
Input: words = ["ab", "ba", "cd", "dc", "ef", "fe"]
Output: 3

Explanation:
- "ab" and "ba" form one pair.
- "cd" and "dc" form one pair.
- "ef" and "fe" form one pair.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input array?**
   - The input array can contain a number of strings from 1 to 100.
   
2. **Are all strings guaranteed to be two letters?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, each string consists of exactly two lowercase English letters.
   
3. **Can the input array contain duplicate strings?**
   - Yes, duplicates are possible in different orders, and each counts as valid pairs if their reversed counterparts exist.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumNumberOfStringPairs = function(words) {
    let reverseCount = new Map();
    let pairs = 0;
    
    for (let word of words) {
        let reversed = word.split('').reverse().join('');
        
        if (reverseCount.has(reversed) && reverseCount.get(reversed) > 0) {
            pairs++;
            reverseCount.set(reversed, reverseCount.get(reversed) - 1);
        } else {
            reverseCount.set(word, (reverseCount.get(word) || 0) + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return pairs;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumNumberOfStringPairs(["ab", "ba", "cd", "dc", "ef", "fe"])); // Output: 3
```

### Strategy

1. **Reversal and Hash Map**: Use a hash map to keep track of the occurrence of each word and its reverse. Iterate through each word and check if its reverse is already in the map. If it is, it forms a pair, decrement the count for the reverse in the map.
   
2. **Count Pairs**: If the reversed version of the word has been seen before and has not yet been paired off (count > 0), increment the pairs counter and decrement the count of the reversed word.

3. **Update Map**: If the reversed word is not found or already paired, then increment the count of the current word in the map.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of words in the array. Each word is processed in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the words and their reverse counts in the map.

This solution is efficient for the given constraints and correctly identifies the maximum number of string pairs in the array.
