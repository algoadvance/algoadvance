[Leetcode 2825. Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2825)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `initial` and `target`. You want to make `initial` a subsequence of `target` by incrementing the characters in `initial` cyclically one at a time. Each character of the string `initial` can be incremented to the next character in alphabetic order, and 'z' wraps around to 'a'. Determine if it is possible to make `initial` a subsequence of `target` using the described cyclic increments.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range for `initial` and `target`?**
   - Both strings `initial` and `target` consist of lowercase letters and have lengths between 1 and 1000.

2. **Can we modify `target`?**
   - No, we can only increment characters in `initial`.

3. **Is the increment cyclic for each character independently?**
   - Yes, each character in `initial` can be incremented independently and cyclically.

### Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Approach:** Use two pointers to traverse both `initial` and `target` strings.
   - Pointer `i` for `initial`.
   - Pointer `j` for `target`.
   
2. **Character Matching with Cycles:**
   - For each character in `initial`, check if it can be matched with any subsequent character in `target` using cyclic increments.
   - If a match is found for the current `initial[i]`, move both pointers `i` and `j` forward.
   - If no match can be found for `initial[i]`, increment `j` pointer to check the next character in `target`.

3. **End Condition:**
   - If pointer `i` has traversed the entire `initial` string, it means we can successfully transform `initial` into a subsequence of `target`.
   - If pointer `j` reaches the end of the `target` string before `i` is complete, it means transformation is not possible.

### Code

```javascript
function canMakeSubsequence(initial, target) {
  let i = 0; // pointer for initial
  let j = 0; // pointer for target

  while (i < initial.length && j < target.length) {
    let currInitialChar = initial.charCodeAt(i);
    let currTargetChar = target.charCodeAt(j);

    if (currInitialChar === currTargetChar ||
        (currInitialChar == 122 && currTargetChar == 97) || // 'z' to 'a'
        currInitialChar + 1 === currTargetChar) {
      i++;
    }
    j++;
  }

  return i === initial.length;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n + m)** where `n` is the length of `initial` and `m` is the length of `target`.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a fixed amount of additional space (pointers `i` and `j`).

### Example

#### Example 1:
```javascript
let initial = "ace";
let target = "abcdef";
console.log(canMakeSubsequence(initial, target)); // true
```

#### Example 2:
```javascript
let initial = "zwx";
let target = "abc";
console.log(canMakeSubsequence(initial, target)); // false
```

By implementing the above logic, we can determine if `initial` can be made a subsequence of `target` using cyclic increments.
