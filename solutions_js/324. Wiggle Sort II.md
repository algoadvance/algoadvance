[Leetcode 324. Wiggle Sort II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l324)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`. You need to reorder it in-place such that:
- `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...` (i.e., nums[0] should be less than nums[1], nums[2] should be less than nums[3], and so on).

The reallocation should be **in-place**, meaning you do not use extra space for another array but may modify the input array directly. Assume all elements in the array are distinct. The solution should be in **O(n)** (or better).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there any constraint on the size of the input array?
    - Typically, `n` could be very large (e.g., `1 <= n <= 100000`).
2. **Element Uniqueness**: Are all elements in the array distinct?
    - Yes, it can be assumed elements are distinct.
3. **Order Characteristics**: Does the array need to be ordered in exact alternation or zig-zag pattern suffices where `nums[0] < nums[1]` and `nums[1] > nums[2]`?

## Strategy

Before we jump into the code, let's discuss the approach.

1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array, we ensure that we have a baseline structure to work from.
2. **Three-Way Partitioning**: Using the concept of the "virtual index" and performing a three-way partitioning (Dutch National Flag problem), we can rearrange the array to fit the wiggle property.
3. **Reassign**: Using the idea of interleaving small and large numbers alternately based on "virtual index".

## Code

Here's the JavaScript solution implementing the outlined approach:

```javascript
var wiggleSort = function(nums) {
    // Sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let n = nums.length;
    let mid = Math.floor((n + 1) / 2);
    
    let left = nums.slice(0, mid);  // smaller half
    let right = nums.slice(mid);    // larger half
    
    // reverse both parts to make it easier to place largest elements first thus breaking equal maximal form
    left = left.reverse();
    right = right.reverse();
    
    // interleave smallest and largest elements
    for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
        nums[j] = left[i];
        if (j + 1 < n) nums[j + 1] = right[i];
        j += 2;
    }
};

// Example Usage:
let nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4];
wiggleSort(nums);
console.log(nums);  // Output should be something like [1, 6, 1, 5, 1, 4]
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**: We start by sorting the array. This gives us a straightforward way to determine the smaller and larger halves.
2. **Slicing Halves**: We divide the sorted array into two halves. The lower half will provide the smaller numbers and the upper half will have larger numbers.
3. **Reverse Array Parts**: We reverse both halves to easily place largest elements first, breaking any equal maxima forms.
4. **Interleaving**: We place elements from the lower half at even indices and elements from the upper half at odd indices.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Creating Slices**: O(n)
- **Interleaving**: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step, which is the dominant term here.
