[Leetcode 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1239)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `arr`, return the maximum length of a concatenated string with unique characters that can be formed by concatenating strings from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can strings in `arr` contain non-lowercase letters or other characters?**
   - Typically, it is assumed that the strings will contain only lowercase English letters unless stated otherwise.

2. **What should be done if a string contains duplicate characters?**
   - If a single string has duplicate characters, it should not be included in the concatenation.

3. **Is there a limit to the number of strings in the array or the length of each string?**
   - The constraints are generally reasonable for competitive programming assumptions, but typically constraints should be checked in the problem description.

4. **Should we consider permutations of the strings or just combinations?**
   - Combinations, not permutations, should be considered. The order of concatenation must be preserved as per the combinations.

### Strategy

1. **Filter out Invalid Strings:** First, filter out strings that have duplicate characters since they can never be part of any valid concatenation.

2. **Backtracking Approach:** Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible concatenations:
   - Add a current string to a combination if the resulting combination has all unique characters.
   - Keep track of the maximum length of valid combinations.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxLength(arr) {
    const isUnique = (str) => {
        const charSet = new Set(str);
        return charSet.size === str.length;
    };

    const backtrack = (index, current) => {
        let maxLength = current.length;
        for (let i = index; i < arr.length; i++) {
            const concatenated = current + arr[i];
            if (isUnique(concatenated)) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, backtrack(i + 1, concatenated));
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    };

    const filteredArr = arr.filter(isUnique);
    return backtrack(0, "");
}
```

### Explanation

1. **isUnique Function:** This function checks if a string has all unique characters by comparing the length of the string with the size of the Set created from the string.

2. **backtrack Function:** This function performs the backtracking:
   - It takes the current index and the current concatenated string.
   - For each string starting from the current index, it tries to concatenate it with the current string.
   - If the concatenated string has all unique characters, it recursively calls itself with the next index and the new string.
   - It keeps track of the maximum valid concatenated string length.

3. **Filtering Invalid Strings:** The array is filtered to remove any strings that contain duplicate characters before starting the backtracking search.

### Time Complexity

- **Filtering:** \(O(N \cdot L)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array and \(L\) is the average length of the strings.
- **Backtracking:** The time complexity of the backtracking approach is \(2^N \cdot N \cdot L\) in the worst case, where \(2^N\) is the number of subsets, \(N\) is the traversal time for each subset, and \(L\) is the time to check the uniqueness of the concatenated string.

Overall, the solution leverages the power of backtracking and filtering to effectively manage and test combinations of strings for unique character properties.
