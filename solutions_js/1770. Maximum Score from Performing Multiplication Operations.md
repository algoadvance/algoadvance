[Leetcode 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1770)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform exactly `m` operations. On the `i-th` operation (1-indexed) you will:

- Choose one integer `x` from either the start or the end of the array `nums`.
- Add `multipliers[i-1] * x` to your score.
- Remove `x` from `nums`.

Return the maximum score after performing `m` operations.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start coding, let's clarify a few points:
1. Is there any constraint on the size of `nums` and `multipliers`?
   - Yes, typically `n` can go up to 10^5 and `m` can go up to 10^3.
2. Are we looking for an optimal solution or just any working solution?
   - We are looking for an optimal solution as brute force will not work due to large constraints.
3. How should we handle negative numbers in `nums` or `multipliers`?
   - The goal is to maximize the score, so handling negatives should be optimized to maximize the product.

### Strategy
Given the constraints, the optimal approach is to use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to keep track of the maximum score achievable for each possible combination of left and right operations.

#### Step-by-step Solution:
1. **Define State**:
   - Let `dp[left][k]` be the maximum score achievable by using `left` elements from the start of `nums` and `k-left` elements from the end of `nums` for the first `k` multipliers.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][0] = 0`: No operations yield a score of zero.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each operation, decide whether to take an element from the start or the end of `nums`:
     - If taking from the start: `dp[left][k] = dp[left-1][k-1] + multipliers[k-1] * nums[left-1]`
     - If taking from the end: `dp[left][k] = dp[left][k-1] + multipliers[k-1] * nums[n-(k-left)]`
     
4. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value in `dp[i][m]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `m`.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} multipliers
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumScore = function(nums, multipliers) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const m = multipliers.length;
    let dp = new Array(m + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(m + 1).fill(0));

    for (let k = 1; k <= m; k++) {
        for (let left = 0; left <= k; left++) {
            const right = k - left;
            if (left > 0) {
                dp[left][k] = Math.max(dp[left][k], dp[left - 1][k - 1] + multipliers[k - 1] * nums[left - 1]);
            }
            if (right > 0) {
                dp[left][k] = Math.max(dp[left][k], dp[left][k - 1] + multipliers[k - 1] * nums[n - right]);
            }
        }
    }

    let maxScore = -Infinity;
    for (let left = 0; left <= m; left++) {
        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, dp[left][m]);
    }

    return maxScore;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m^2)` because the double loop runs with `m` operations. The space complexity is also `O(m^2)` due to storing the `dp` array. Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough for `m` up to `1000`.
