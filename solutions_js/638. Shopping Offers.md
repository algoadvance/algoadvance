[Leetcode 638. Shopping Offers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l638)
### Problem Statement
In LeetCode's Problem 638, "Shopping Offers", you need to decide the minimum amount of money you need to spend to buy certain quantities of specific items. 

You have access to the following information:
1. `price[i]` : The price of the i-th item.
2. `special` : A list of special offers where each offer is a list of the form `[x1, x2, ..., xk, price]` which means you can buy `x1` of item 1, `x2` of item 2, ..., `xk` of item k at the `price`.
3. `needs` : A list representing the number of items you need to buy for each item.

The goal is to determine the minimum cost to satisfy the shopping list given the special offers and individual prices.

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach**: Since the problem requires exploring all possible ways to buy items with the goal of minimizing cost, a recursive approach with memoization (to eliminate repeated calculations) is suitable. 
2. **Base Case**: If no items are needed, the cost is 0.
3. **Using Special Offers**: For each offer, check if it can be used (i.e., reduces quantities for all items without going negative). If an offer is applicable, recursively calculate the cost for the reduced needs.
4. **Skipping Offers**: Calculate the cost without using any special offers, which is simply the cost of buying remaining items directly.
5. **Memoization**: Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} price
 * @param {number[][]} special
 * @param {number[]} needs
 * @return {number}
 */
var shoppingOffers = function (price, special, needs) {
    let memo = new Map();

    const dfs = (currentNeeds) => {
        // Convert needs array to string to use as a map key
        let needsKey = currentNeeds.toString();

        // Return memoized result if exists
        if (memo.has(needsKey)) {
            return memo.get(needsKey);
        }

        // Calculate cost without any special offer
        let minCost = currentNeeds.reduce((total, need, i) => total + (need * price[i]), 0);

        // Try every special offer
        for (let offer of special) {
            let valid = true;
            let newNeeds = [...currentNeeds];

            for (let i = 0; i < currentNeeds.length; i++) {
                newNeeds[i] -= offer[i];
                if (newNeeds[i] < 0) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (valid) {
                minCost = Math.min(minCost, offer[offer.length - 1] + dfs(newNeeds));
            }
        }

        // Store result in memoization map
        memo.set(needsKey, minCost);
        return minCost;
    };

    return dfs(needs);
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is hard to characterize precisely because it depends on the branching factor at each node (how many valid offers are available) and the depth of recursion (how many levels needed to reduce all needs to zero). 

However, using memoization ensures each unique state of `needs` is processed only once, which significantly improves efficiency compared to a naive recursive approach. The worst-case scenario involves checking each subset of specials for each combination of items, but memoization helps prune the number of re-evaluated states. 

### Summary
This approach uses a recursive depth-first search with memoization to explore all combinations of applying special offers and directly buying items to find the minimum cost to satisfy the given `needs`. This solution ensures both flexibility and efficiency, making it effective for this problem.
