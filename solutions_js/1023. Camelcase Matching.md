[Leetcode 1023. Camelcase Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1023)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of queries `queries` and a string `pattern`, write a function `camelMatch(queries, pattern)` that determines if each query matches the given pattern following these rules:

- A query matches the pattern if the characters of the pattern appear in sequence in the query, with any other characters allowed in between.
- All uppercase characters in the pattern must match uppercase characters in the query in the same order.

Return a boolean array where each element indicates if the corresponding query matches the pattern.

Example:

```javascript
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
Output: [true, false, true, true, false]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the pattern and queries contain both uppercase and lowercase characters?
2. Is the pattern guaranteed to be non-empty?
3. What do we return if the `queries` list itself is empty?
4. Should we consider cases in the pattern that do not have any uppercase letters?

### Code

```javascript
function camelMatch(queries, pattern) {
    const matchesPattern = (query, pattern) => {
        let pIndex = 0;
        
        for (let qIndex = 0; qIndex < query.length; qIndex++) {
            if (pIndex < pattern.length && query[qIndex] === pattern[pIndex]) {
                pIndex++;
            } else if (query[qIndex] >= 'A' && query[qIndex] <= 'Z') {
                if (pIndex >= pattern.length || query[qIndex] !== pattern[pIndex]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return pIndex === pattern.length;
    };

    return queries.map(query => matchesPattern(query, pattern));
}

// Example usage:
const queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"];
const pattern = "FB";
console.log(camelMatch(queries, pattern)); // [true, false, true, true, false]
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Indices:** For each query, maintain an index (`pIndex`) to track the current position in the pattern.
2. **Iterate Through Query:** For each character in the query:
   - If the current character matches the current position in the pattern, move to the next character in the pattern.
   - If the character is an uppercase letter but does not match the current pattern character, return false.
3. **Check Completion:** After iterating through the query, ensure that the entire pattern has been matched (`pIndex === pattern.length`).
4. **Using Map for Results:** Apply the `matchesPattern` function to each query using `Array.map`.

### Time Complexity

- **Query Processing:** Each query is processed in O(m) time where m is the length of the query.
- **Pattern Checking:** Each query is checked against a pattern of length n in O(m).
- **Overall:** If there are Q queries, the total time complexity is O(Q * m), where m is the average length of a query.
