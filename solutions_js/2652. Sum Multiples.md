[Leetcode 2652. Sum Multiples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2652)
**Problem Statement:**

Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

Write a function `sumOfMultiples(n: number): number` that returns the sum of all such integers.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   - Yes.
2. Should we consider `n` itself in the range `[1, n]`?
   - Yes.
3. Are the numbers divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7` inclusive or exclusive?
   - Inclusive.
4. What should be the return value if `n` is `1`?
   - Since `1` is not divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`, the result should be `0`.

**Code:**

```javascript
function sumOfMultiples(n) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0 || i % 7 === 0) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

---

**Strategy:**

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the cumulative sum of numbers divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.
2. Iterate through every integer `i` from `1` to `n`.
3. For each integer `i`, check if it is divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.
4. If `i` is divisible by any of these numbers, add it to the `sum`.
5. Return the calculated `sum` after completing the loop.

**Time Complexity:**

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the input number. This is because we iterate through each number from `1` to `n` exactly once and perform constant-time operations within the loop.
