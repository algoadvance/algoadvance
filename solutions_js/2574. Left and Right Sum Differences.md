[Leetcode 2574. Left and Right Sum Differences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2574)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. 
  - Compute the sum of the elements to the left and right of each element.

The left sum of an element at index `i` is the sum of all the elements to the left of `i` in the array. If there are no elements to the left of `i`, the left sum is `0`.

The right sum of an element at index `i` is the sum of all the elements to the right of `i` in the array. If there are no elements to the right of `i`, the right sum is `0`.

Return a list `answer` where `answer[i]` is the **absolute difference** between the left sum and the right sum of the element at index `i`.

### Example:

```text
Input: nums = [10, 4, 8, 3]
Output: [15, 1, 11, 22]
Explanation:
The left sums are: [0, 10, 14, 22]
The right sums are: [15, 11, 3, 0]
The absolute differences are: |0-15|, |10-11|, |14-3|, |22-0| = [15, 1, 11, 22]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints:**
    - 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    - -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

2. **Input & Output:**
   - Always integers in the input array.
   - Output will be a list of integers representing the absolute differences.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Left Sums:**
   - Initialize an array `leftSums` of the same length as `nums` with zeros.
   - Iterate through the array from left to right and populate `leftSums` such that `leftSums[i]` contains the sum of all elements to the left of `nums[i]`.

2. **Calculate Right Sums:**
   - Similarly, initialize an array `rightSums` of the same length as `nums` with zeros.
   - Iterate through the array from right to left and populate `rightSums` such that `rightSums[i]` contains the sum of all elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

3. **Compute Absolute Differences:**
   - Create an array `answer` where each element is the absolute difference between corresponding elements in `leftSums` and `rightSums`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the array `answer`.

## Code

```javascript
function leftRightDifference(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const leftSums = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const rightSums = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const result = new Array(n);

    // Calculate left sums
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        leftSums[i] = leftSums[i - 1] + nums[i - 1];
    }

    // Calculate right sums
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        rightSums[i] = rightSums[i + 1] + nums[i + 1];
    }

    // Calculate absolute differences
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = Math.abs(leftSums[i] - rightSums[i]);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Constructing the `leftSums` and `rightSums` arrays takes `O(n)` time each, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
  - Calculating the absolute differences also takes `O(n)` time.
  - Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - We use three additional arrays (`leftSums`, `rightSums`, `result`), each of size `n`.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.
