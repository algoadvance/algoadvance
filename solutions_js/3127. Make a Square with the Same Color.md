[Leetcode 3127. Make a Square with the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3127)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid where each cell is painted one of four colors: 'R' (Red), 'G' (Green), 'B' (Blue), or 'Y' (Yellow). You need to determine the side length of the largest square that can be formed within the grid such that all the cells in this square are of the same color.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range and Constraints:**
    - What is the range of `n`? 
    - Are the grid rows and columns always greater than zero?
    - Will the input grid always be valid with characters from 'R', 'G', 'B', 'Y' only?

2. **Expected Output:**
    - What should the function return if no square can be formed or the input grid is empty?

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use a 2D array (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at `(i, j)` and contains only cells of the same color.
    - Initialize each `dp[i][j]` to `1` if that's the minimum size for any single cell.
    - For each cell in the grid, consider the cell values to the left, above, and top-left.
    - If the current cell color matches with neighboring cells, then `dp[i][j]` will be 1 plus the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    
2. **Algorithm Steps:**
    - Create a 2D array `dp` initialized with `0`.
    - Traverse the grid starting from the top-left corner.
    - For each cell, update the `dp` array based on the above conditions.
    - Keep track of the maximum value found in `dp`, which gives the side length of the largest square.

3. **Time Complexity:**
    - Initialization and iteration over the grid is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of rows (and columns) in the grid.
    - Overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

### Code

```javascript
function largestSquare(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    let maxSide = 0;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                dp[i][j] = 1;  // Any single cell can be a 1x1 square
            } else if (grid[i][j] == grid[i-1][j] && grid[i][j] == grid[i][j-1] && grid[i][j] == grid[i-1][j-1]) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1;  // Consider this cell independently if neighbors don't match
            }
            maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
        }
    }

    return maxSide;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G'],
    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G'],
    ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G'],
    ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G']
];
console.log(largestSquare(grid));  // Output should be 3 for the example grid
```

### Explanation of Example

For the given grid:
```
R R R G
R R R G
R R R G
G G G G
```
The largest square of the same color is the 3x3 square of 'R'. Hence, the function should return 3.

In the code:
1. `dp` is initialized and filled based on the above conditions.
2. The maximum side length found in the `dp` array is returned.
