[Leetcode 1499. Max Value of Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1499)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an array `points` containing points of the form `[xi, yi]`, and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum value of the equation `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` such that `|xi - xj| <= k` and `i â‰  j`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values for `points`?
    - How large can `k` be?
    - Are the points sorted by their `x` coordinates?

Assuming typical constraints for a competitive programming problem:
- The `points` array contains up to `10^5` elements.
- Each `point` is a pair of integers within a reasonable range, say `-10^9` to `10^9`.
- `k` is also an integer within a similar range.
- Points are sorted by their `x` coordinates in non-decreasing order.

## Strategy:
We can use a **sliding window with a priority queue (or deque)** to efficiently solve this problem. The main idea is to maintain a window of points such that for any point `j`, we keep track of points `i` such that `xi` is within `k` units of `xj`. 

### Steps:
1. Initialize a deque to maintain the potential maximum values of the equation `yj + yi + |xi - xj|`. The deque will store pairs of values `(yi - xi, xi)`, sorted by the first element.
2. Iterate through the list of points. For each point `(xj, yj)`:
    - Remove points from the deque that don't satisfy the condition `|xi - xj| <= k`.
    - Calculate the maximum value using the current point and the best candidate from the deque.
    - Add the current point to the deque while maintaining order.

This approach ensures that each point is added and removed from the deque at most once, leading to an efficient solution.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of points. This is because each point is added and removed from the deque at most once.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var findMaxValueOfEquation = function(points, k) {
    let deque = []; // Will store pairs [yi - xi, xi]
    let maxVal = -Infinity;

    for (const [xj, yj] of points) {
        // Remove elements where the distance is > k
        while (deque.length > 0 && xj - deque[0][1] > k) {
            deque.shift();
        }

        // Compute the current max value using deque's front element
        if (deque.length > 0) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, yj + xj + deque[0][0]);
        }

        // Add current point to deque, ensuring it's ordered by the first element.
        while (deque.length > 0 && deque[deque.length - 1][0] <= yj - xj) {
            deque.pop();
        }

        deque.push([yj - xj, xj]);
    }

    return maxVal;
};
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
1. **Deque Initialization**: We initialize a deque to store pairs of `(yi - xi, xi)`.
2. **Main Loop**: We iterate through each point `(xj, yj)`.
   - **Remove Out of Range**: Remove pairs from the front of the deque if they don't satisfy the distance condition `|xi - xj| <= k`.
   - **Calculate Maximum**: Use the front of the deque to calculate the possible maximum value with the current point.
   - **Maintain Deque Order**: Add the current point `(yj - xj, xj)` to the deque, ensuring that it's maintained in decreasing order of `yi - xi`.
   
This method ensures we efficiently find the maximum value of the equation for the given constraints.
