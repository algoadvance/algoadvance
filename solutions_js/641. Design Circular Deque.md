[Leetcode 641. Design Circular Deque](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l641)
### Problem Statement

Design a circular deque based on the following operations:

- `MyCircularDeque(k)`: Initializes the deque with a maximum size of `k`.
- `insertFront()`: Adds an item at the front of Deque. Returns `true` if the operation is successful, and `false` otherwise.
- `insertLast()`: Adds an item at the rear of Deque. Returns `true` if the operation is successful, and `false` otherwise.
- `deleteFront()`: Deletes an item from the front of Deque. Returns `true` if the operation is successful, and `false` otherwise.
- `deleteLast()`: Deletes an item from the rear of Deque. Returns `true` if the operation is successful, and `false` otherwise.
- `getFront()`: Gets the front item from the Deque. If the deque is empty, return `-1`.
- `getRear()`: Gets the last item from the Deque. If the deque is empty, return `-1`.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks whether Deque is empty.
- `isFull()`: Checks whether Deque is full.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the expected values/types for the items to be inserted?
   - Just integers or any data type?
2. Should we handle any specific edge cases apart from those mentioned (e.g., negative values for `k`)?
3. Can we assume that the `k` value will always be valid (positive integer)?

### Strategy

We can implement the circular deque using an array and two pointers `front` and `rear` to keep track of the start and end positions within the array. Additionally, a `count` variable can be used to keep track of the number of elements currently in the deque.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. **Initialization (`MyCircularDeque(k)`)**:
   - Use an array of size `k`.
   - Initialize `front` and `rear` to -1 indicating an empty deque.
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
2. **Insertion**:
   - For `insertFront`, adjust the `front` pointer backwards and insert the element if not full.
   - For `insertLast`, adjust the `rear` pointer forwards and insert the element if not full.
3. **Deletion**:
   - For `deleteFront`, adjust the `front` pointer forwards.
   - For `deleteLast`, adjust the `rear` pointer backwards.
4. **Access Methods (`getFront`, `getRear`)**:
   - Provide access to the front and rear elements without modification.
5. **State Checks (`isEmpty`, `isFull`)**:
   - Compare `count` with 0 for empty and with `k` for full.

### Code

```javascript
class MyCircularDeque {
    constructor(k) {
        this.capacity = k;
        this.queue = new Array(k).fill(null);
        this.front = -1;
        this.rear = -1;
        this.count = 0;
    }

    insertFront(value) {
        if (this.isFull()) return false;

        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            this.front = this.rear = 0;
        } else {
            this.front = (this.front - 1 + this.capacity) % this.capacity;
        }

        this.queue[this.front] = value;
        this.count++;
        return true;
    }

    insertLast(value) {
        if (this.isFull()) return false;

        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            this.front = this.rear = 0;
        } else {
            this.rear = (this.rear + 1) % this.capacity;
        }

        this.queue[this.rear] = value;
        this.count++;
        return true;
    }

    deleteFront() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return false;

        if (this.front === this.rear) {
            this.front = this.rear = -1;
        } else {
            this.front = (this.front + 1) % this.capacity;
        }

        this.count--;
        return true;
    }

    deleteLast() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return false;

        if (this.front === this.rear) {
            this.front = this.rear = -1;
        } else {
            this.rear = (this.rear - 1 + this.capacity) % this.capacity;
        }

        this.count--;
        return true;
    }

    getFront() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return -1;
        return this.queue[this.front];
    }

    getRear() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) return -1;
        return this.queue[this.rear];
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.count === 0;
    }

    isFull() {
        return this.count === this.capacity;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertions** (`insertFront` and `insertLast`): O(1)
- **Deletions** (`deleteFront` and `deleteLast`): O(1)
- **Access** (`getFront` and `getRear`): O(1)
- **Checks** (`isEmpty` and `isFull`): O(1)

This ensures that all operations are performed in constant time, adhering to the expected efficiency for a deque implementation.
