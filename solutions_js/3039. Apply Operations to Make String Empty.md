[Leetcode 3039. Apply Operations to Make String Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3039)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:

1. **Delete** the **entire string** `s`, if all the characters of `s` are the same, or
2. **Delete** the **first i** characters of `s` if `s[0]`, `s[1]`, ..., `s[i-1]` are all the same for some `1 <= i <= s.length`.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` empty.*

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the length of `s`?
   - Constraints were not provided, but we can assume typical constraints for such problems like `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

2. Is `s` guaranteed to consist only of lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies this.

3. Should we consider time complexity and try to optimize the solution?
   - Yes, an optimal solution should be aimed for, ideally linear time complexity due to the potential size of `s`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** If `s` is already the same character repeated, it would take exactly one operation to delete it.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - We will use a single scan of the string to count clusters of contiguous characters. Each cluster count represents a potential operation.
3. **Count Clusters:**
   - Traverse through the string and every time a character changes, increment the number of operations required.
4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Handle cases where the string is already very short (like length 1).

## Code

```javascript
var minimumOperations = function(s) {
    if (s.length === 0) return 0;
    
    let operations = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] !== s[i - 1]) {
            operations++;
        }
    }
    return operations;
};

// Example test cases
console.log(minimumOperations("aaa")) // Output: 1
console.log(minimumOperations("ababa")) // Output: 5
console.log(minimumOperations("aaabbb")) // Output: 2
console.log(minimumOperations("a")) // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We scan through the string once to count the number of clusters.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we're using a constant amount of space for the operations counter.
