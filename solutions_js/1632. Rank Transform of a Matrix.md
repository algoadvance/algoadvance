[Leetcode 1632. Rank Transform of a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1632)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `matrix`. You are asked to perform a *rank transform* on the matrix. Specifically, you need to generate a new matrix such that:

1. The rank of a value is the smallest number such that the transformed value is aligned correctly, both row-wise and column-wise.
2. The rank of a value is an integer starting from 1.
3. If two values are equal, they must have the same rank.

The `rank` of a value `v` in `matrix` is defined as such:
- The rank of `v` is the smallest integer `r` such that:
  - For any value less than `v`, its resulting rank is less than `r` in both the same row and the same column.

You need to return the transformed matrix.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What are the typical constraints on the size of the matrix `m x n`?
   - Constraints: `m` and `n` can range from `1` to `500`.

2. **Element Values:** Are there any constraints on the values in the matrix?
   - The elements of the matrix are integers ranging between `-10^9` to `10^9`.

3. **Output Validity:** Should all equal values across the matrix have the same rank?
   - Yes, all equal values must have the same rank.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Parse the matrix and keep track of the positions of each unique value.
   - Use a sorting mechanism to handle values from smallest to largest.

2. **Union-Find:** We'll use a Union-Find (or Disjoint-Set Union) data structure:
   - This will help efficiently connect ranks within the same row and column.

3. **Rank Calculation:**
   - Traverse the values in order, and for each value, update the ranks considering the union-find groups formed within the same row and column.

4. **Result Formation:**
   - Construct the resulting matrix with the calculated ranks.

5. **Implementation:** We'll implement the above logic in JavaScript using the union-find approach for efficient rank updates.

## Code

```javascript
function matrixRankTransform(matrix) {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;

    const posMap = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (!posMap[matrix[i][j]]) posMap[matrix[i][j]] = [];
            posMap[matrix[i][j]].push([i, j]);
        }
    }

    const sortedVals = Object.keys(posMap).map(Number).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    const parent = Array.from({ length: m + n }, (_, index) => index);
    const rank = Array(m + n).fill(0);

    const find = (x) => {
        if (parent[x] !== x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    const union = (x, y) => {
        const rootX = find(x);
        const rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) parent[rootY] = rootX;
            else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) parent[rootX] = rootY;
            else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

    const res = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    for (const val of sortedVals) {
        const ranks = {};
        for (const [i, j] of posMap[val]) {
            const pRow = find(i);
            const pCol = find(j + m);
            union(i, j + m);
            const pRoot = find(i);
            ranks[pRoot] = Math.max(rank[pRow], rank[pCol]);
        }
        for (const [i, j] of posMap[val]) {
            const pRoot = find(i);
            const newRank = ranks[pRoot] + 1;
            rank[i] = newRank;
            rank[j + m] = newRank;
            res[i][j] = newRank;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting the unique values in the matrix takes \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\).
- **Union-Find Operations:** Each union-find operation (union and find) is nearly constant time \(O(\alpha(n))\), where \(\alpha(n)\) is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Overall Complexity:** Given operations on each element during rank assignment scales linearly with the number of unique elements, the overall complexity can be approximated as \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\).
