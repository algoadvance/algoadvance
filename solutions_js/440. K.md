[Leetcode 440. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l440)
### Problem Statement:
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k`-th lexicographical order of the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of n and k:** What is the typical range of `n` and `k`? Are they guaranteed to be within certain limits?
   - _Assumption: `n` will be within the range of 1 to `10^9` and `k` will be between 1 and `n`._

2. **Data types:** Is there any constraint on the data type to hold the numbers considering the possible large values of `n`?
   - _Assumption: The problem can be solved using standard integer data types._

3. **Output format:** Should the output be in numerical form or as a string?
   - _Assumption: The output is to be returned as a numerical value._

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding Lexicographical Order:** Lexicographical order is the order in which words or strings are arranged in a dictionary; it's essentially the "dictionary order". For numbers, this means comparing them as strings.

2. **Prefix-Based Counting:** To efficiently determine the k-th smallest lexicographical number, one can use a prefix-based counting strategy:
   - Starting with the smallest prefix, count how many numbers start with that prefix.
   - Use the count to decide which prefix to explore next.
   - Decrease `k` as we count down the possible numbers that start with smaller prefixes.

3. **Counting Nodes in Prefix:** The count of numbers with a particular prefix can be determined by generating them and countingâ€”considering the constraints of `n`.

### Code:
```javascript
var findKthNumber = function(n, k) {
  const countSteps = (prefix, n) => {
    let current = prefix;
    let next = prefix + 1;
    let steps = 0;
    while (current <= n) {
      steps += Math.min(n + 1, next) - current;
      current *= 10;
      next *= 10;
    }
    return steps;
  };
  
  let current = 1;
  k--; // Decrease k by 1 because we start with the first number by default.
  
  while (k > 0) {
    let steps = countSteps(current, n);
    if (steps <= k) {
      k -= steps;
      current += 1;
    } else {
      current *= 10;
      k -= 1;
    }
  }
  
  return current;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findKthNumber(13, 2)); // Outputs: 10
```

### Explanation:
1. **countSteps Function:**
   - This helper function counts how many numbers exist between `prefix` and `prefix+1` within the range up to `n`. This helps in knowing how many steps you can skip or if you need to go deeper into the prefix.

2. **While Loop:**
   - Start from `current = 1`.
   - Reduce `k` by the number of lexicographical steps you can skip.
   - If the steps are less than or equal to `k`, move to the next prefix (`current += 1`) because the k-th number isn't in the current prefix range.
   - If the steps are greater than `k`, go deeper into the current prefix by multiplying `current` by 10 (`current *= 10`).

3. Adjust `k` accordingly each iteration until it becomes zero.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is approximately \( O(\log(n)^2) \) because each node traversal divides the prefix space and counting steps involves logarithmic depth multiplication. This is efficient given the constraints.
