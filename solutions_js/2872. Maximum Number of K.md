[Leetcode 2872. Maximum Number of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2872)
### Problem Statement

Given a tree represented as an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and an integer `k`, you need to find the maximum number of edges you can remove such that each resulting component’s sum of values is divisible by `k`. Here, the tree is described using a `0-indexed` array `A` of length `n` where `A[i]` represents the value associated with node `i` and an array of edges where `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates an edge between node `u` and `node v`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Types & Ranges**:
   - Are values in the array `A` and nodes in the edges always within a given range?
   - Can there be duplicate values in the array `A`?

2. **Output**:
   - Is the output expected to be a single integer value representing the maximum number of edges that can be removed?

3. **Assumptions**:
   - Are node values in the array `A` non-negative or can they include negative numbers?
   - Should we handle any invalid cases (like empty arrays or disconnected graphs)?

### Strategy

1. **Tree Structure**:
   - Trees are connected, acyclic graphs. This simplifies the problem since every pair of nodes is connected by exactly one simple path.

2. **DFS for Sum Calculation**:
   - Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) from any node (let’s start from node 0).
   - At each node, calculate the subtree sum and check if this sum modulo `k` equals 0.

3. **Edge Removal**:
   - For every subtree whose sum modulo `k` equals 0, count that subtree as a potential removable component.
   - For a valid removal, the subtree sum of each component must be divisible by `k`, and the overall structure should still be valid.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use a recursive DFS to traverse the tree.
   - Store the sum of each subtree and increment a counter whenever a subtree’s sum is divisible by `k`.

### Solution Code

```javascript
const maxKDivisibleComponents = (n, k, A, edges) => {
    // Create adjacency list for the tree
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }

    // To store the result
    let result = 0;

    // DFS function to calculate the subtree sum
    const dfs = (node, parent) => {
        let subtreeSum = A[node];
        
        // Traverse all adjacent nodes
        for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor !== parent) {
                subtreeSum += dfs(neighbor, node);
            }
        }

        // If the subtree sum is divisible by k, it is a valid component
        if (subtreeSum % k === 0) {
            result++;
            return 0; // This means we can cut this edge
        } else {
            return subtreeSum;
        }
    };

    // Start DFS from node 0, assume `dfs(0, -1)` means node 0 with no parent
    dfs(0, -1);

    // Subtract 1 from result because the entire tree is counted as one initially
    return result - 1;
};

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const k = 3;
const A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4]];

console.log(maxKDivisibleComponents(n, k, A, edges)); // Output: 2 (Subtree sums [6, 3] after removing two edges)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - This results because we are performing a single DFS traversal of the tree, and the overhead of sum calculation and modulo operations is linear concerning the number of nodes.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - This is due to the space required for the adjacency list and the recursive call stack depth in DFS, which at maximum will be the height of the tree (O(n) in the worst case).

This solution efficiently computes the maximum number of k-divisible components by leveraging the properties of tree traversal and modulo operations.
