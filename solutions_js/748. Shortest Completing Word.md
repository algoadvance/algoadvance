[Leetcode 748. Shortest Completing Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l748)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the shortest completing word in `words`. 

A completing word is a word that contains all the characters (ignoring digits, and case) present in the `licensePlate`. The completing word should occur in its original form in the array `words`. If multiple words are possible, return the one that appears first in the array.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= licensePlate.length <= 7`
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 15`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity:** Are the letters in `licensePlate` case-sensitive?
   - No, they are not case-sensitive. 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same character.
   
2. **Digits in License Plate:** Should the digits in `licensePlate` be ignored?
   - Yes, digits should be ignored.
   
3. **Special Characters:** Are there any special characters in `licensePlate`?
   - Only alphabetic characters and digits are relevant; other characters (if any) should be ignored.

### Strategy

1. **Filter Out Letters:** Extract and count the frequency of each letter in `licensePlate`, ignoring digits and converting all letters to lowercase.
2. **Check Each Word:** For each word in `words`, convert it to lowercase and count the frequency of each letter.
3. **Comparison:** Check if the word contains at least as many of each letter as required by the `licensePlate`.
4. **Track Shortest Word:** Keep track of the shortest completing word found during the process.

### Code

Let's write the code following the above strategy.

```javascript
function shortestCompletingWord(licensePlate, words) {
    // Filter out letters and count frequencies from licensePlate
    const plateCount = getLetterCount(licensePlate);
    
    let shortestWord = null;
    
    for (let word of words) {
        const wordCount = getLetterCount(word);
        
        if (isCompletingWord(plateCount, wordCount)) {
            if (shortestWord === null || word.length < shortestWord.length) {
                shortestWord = word;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return shortestWord;
}

function getLetterCount(str) {
    const count = {};
    for (let char of str.toLowerCase()) {
        if (char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') {
            count[char] = (count[char] || 0) + 1;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

function isCompletingWord(plateCount, wordCount) {
    for (let char in plateCount) {
        if (!(char in wordCount) || wordCount[char] < plateCount[char]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting:** Creating the count object for the `licensePlate` takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `licensePlate`. This is a constant time operation since the length of `licensePlate` is at most 7.
  
- **Word Processing:** For each word in the `words` array, we perform frequency counting which takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the word. Since we may check up to 1000 words, the worst-case complexity for this processing is \(O(km)\), where \(k\) is the number of words.

- **Overall Complexity:** The overall complexity will be \(O(km)\), where \(k\) is the number of words and \(m\) is the average length of the words. Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough.

This solution efficiently finds the shortest completing word by counting and comparing character frequencies for each word in the list against the desired frequencies derived from the license plate.
