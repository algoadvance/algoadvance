[Leetcode 2915. Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2915)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the length of the longest subsequence such that the sum of the subsequence is equal to `target`. If no such subsequence exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if there are multiple subsequences that sum to the target and have the same length?**
   - We only need to return the length of the longest subsequence.

2. **What if there are multiple longest subsequences of the same length?**
   - The answer will be the same (length of the longest subsequence).

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers and zeros.

### Strategy

1. **Define the Problem with Subproblems:**
   - We need a way to find subsequences in the array that sum up to the target.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming and Set Approach:**
   - We'll use a dynamic approach to keep track of all possible sums that can be made using elements of the array, along with the lengths of subsequences that result in those sums.
   - We'll use a dictionary to store sums and their corresponding maximum lengths of subsequences that yield those sums.
   
3. **Iterate Over Array Elements:**
   - For each element in the array, we update our dictionary of sums to take into account the new element, ensuring that we consider both including and excluding the element.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is empty, return -1.
   - Check if no subsequence can form the target sum by the end of iteration and handle accordingly.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity will depend on the number of elements in `nums` and the number of unique sums that we can form.
- Time Complexity: \(O(n \times m)\) where `n` is the length of the array and `m` is the number of possible sums encountered.

### Code

```javascript
function maxLengthSubsequenceWithSum(nums, target) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return -1;

    let sumsMap = new Map();
    sumsMap.set(0, 0); // sum 0 has a subsequence of length 0

    for (let num of nums) {
        let currentSums = new Map(sumsMap);
        for (let [sum, length] of currentSums.entries()) {
            let newSum = sum + num;
            let newLength = length + 1;
            if (!sumsMap.has(newSum) || sumsMap.get(newSum) < newLength) {
                sumsMap.set(newSum, newLength);
            }
        }
    }

    return sumsMap.has(target) ? sumsMap.get(target) : -1;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let target = 7;
console.log(maxLengthSubsequenceWithSum(nums, target)); // Output: 2 (subsequence [2, 5])
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a dictionary `sumsMap` where the key is a sum and the value is the length of the subsequence that forms that sum.
   - Start with `sumsMap` containing `(0, 0)`, representing the sum zero with a subsequence length of zero.

2. **Iterate over Elements:**
   - For each element in `nums`, clone the current `sumsMap` to `currentSums` to avoid modifying the dictionary while iterating.
   - For each existing sum in `currentSums`, calculate the new potential sum by adding the current number.
   - Update `sumsMap` if the new sum is not present or if this new subsequence is longer than the previous one for this sum.

3. **Result:**
   - After processing all elements, check if `sumsMap` contains the target sum and return the length of the subsequence that forms this sum.
   - Return `-1` if no such subsequence exists.
