[Leetcode 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1979)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the smallest number and largest number in `nums`. The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.

### Example
- **Input:** `nums = [2,5,6,9,10]`
- **Output:** `2`
  - Explanation: The smallest number is 2 and the largest number is 10. The GCD of 2 and 10 is 2.

- **Input:** `nums = [7,5,6,8,3]`
- **Output:** `1`
  - Explanation: The smallest number is 3 and the largest number is 8. The GCD of 3 and 8 is 1.

- **Input:** `nums = [3,3]`
- **Output:** `3`
  - Explanation: The smallest number is 3 and the largest number is 3. The GCD of 3 and 3 is 3.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Size:**
   - What is the maximum size of `nums`?
     
     The constraints are typically provided but let's assume a reasonably large size, such as up to 10^4.

2. **Element Size:**
   - What are the possible values for the integers within `nums`?
     
     Assuming standard constraints for array elements, values might range from 1 up to 10^6.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Can `nums` contain negative numbers, or is it guaranteed to be only positive integers?
     
     Assuming `nums` contains only positive integers based on typical problem constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Finding Extremes:**
   - Identify the smallest and largest number in the `nums` array.

2. **Calculating GCD:**
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient for GCD calculation.

3. **Steps:**
   1. Find the smallest number (`minNum`) in the array.
   2. Find the largest number (`maxNum`) in the array.
   3. Compute the GCD of `minNum` and `maxNum`.

## Code

```javascript
function findGCD(nums) {
    // Function to compute GCD using Euclidean algorithm
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            [a, b] = [b, a % b];
        }
        return a;
    }
    
    const minNum = Math.min(...nums);
    const maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    
    return gcd(minNum, maxNum);
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(findGCD([2, 5, 6, 9, 10])); // Output: 2
console.log(findGCD([7, 5, 6, 8, 3]));  // Output: 1
console.log(findGCD([3, 3]));           // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding Min/Max:** `O(n)` - where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **GCD Computation:** `O(log(min(a, b)))` - where `a` and `b` are the numbers being compared.

### Overall Time Complexity: `O(n + log(min(a, b)))`
- The dominant term is `O(n)` due to the minimum and maximum finding operations. The GCD computation, while logarithmic in nature, is typically overshadowed by the linear scan to find the minimum and maximum.

This complexity ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger arrays.
