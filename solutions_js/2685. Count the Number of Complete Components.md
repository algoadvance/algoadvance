[Leetcode 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2685)
## Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph consisting of `n` vertices and the edges array, count the number of complete components in the graph.
A component is complete if it is a fully connected subgraph, i.e., every pair of distinct vertices in the component is connected by a unique edge.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` and the number of edges?**
   - This will help us determine if a brute-force solution is feasible or if we need an optimized approach.

2. **Are the graph vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`?**
   - Understanding the vertex labels helps us in initializing our structures correctly.

3. **Can the graph have multiple edges between the same pair of vertices?**
   - This will impact how we build our adjacency list or matrix.

4. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - This affects how we identify components.

5. **Are there any constraints on the input edges array?**
   - Are edges valid and within the range defined by `n`?

Assuming standard constraints for graph problems on platforms like LeetCode:

1. \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)
2. The number of edges usually depends on \(n\).

## Code

```javascript
function countCompleteComponents(n, edges) {
    // Helper function for DFS traversal
    const dfs = (node, visited, adjList, component) => {
        visited[node] = true;
        component.push(node);
        for (let neighbor of adjList[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, visited, adjList, component);
            }
        }
    };

    // Build adjacency list
    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push(v);
        adjList[v].push(u);
    }

    const visited = Array(n).fill(false);
    let count = 0;

    // Traverse all nodes
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            let component = [];
            dfs(i, visited, adjList, component);
            // Check if the component is complete
            let isComplete = true;
            for (let u of component) {
                if (adjList[u].length !== component.length - 1) {
                    isComplete = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isComplete) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example Usage
const n = 6;
const edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [3, 4]];
console.log(countCompleteComponents(n, edges)); // Output: 2
```

## Strategy

1. **Create an Adjacency List:** Convert the edge list into an adjacency list representation of the graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Use DFS to explore each component of the graph.
3. **Identify Complete Components:**
   - For each component found via DFS, check if every node in the component has exactly `component_size - 1` neighbors.
   - This ensures that every node is connected to every other node within the component.
4. **Count the Complete Components:** Increase the count for each component that meets the criteria.

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the Adjacency List:** \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
2. **DFS Traversal:** \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.
3. **Checking Complete Component:** For each connected component, the check is \(O(V)\).
   
   Given there are \(k\) components each with \(V_i\) vertices, total complexity of this step is \(O(\sum V_i) = O(V)\).

Overall time complexity: **\(O(V + E)\)**, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
