[Leetcode 896. Monotonic Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l896)
### Problem Statement

An array is considered monotonic if it is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.

An array `nums` is monotonically increasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. An array `nums` is monotonically decreasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] >= nums[j]`.

Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the given array is monotonic, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the array length?
     - The length of the array can be between `1` and `100000` inclusive.
   - What kind of elements does the array contain?
     - The array contains integers that can be positive, negative, or zero.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle arrays of length `1`?
     - An array of length `1` is considered monotonic.
   - Are arrays with all identical elements considered monotonic?
     - Yes, arrays with all identical elements are both monotonically increasing and decreasing.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the array has one or zero elements, it is monotonic by definition.
   
2. **Single Pass Algorithm:**
   - Traverse the array in a single pass to check for both increasing and decreasing sequences.
   - Use two flags: `isIncreasing` and `isDecreasing`.
   - Initialize both flags to `true`.
   - Iterate through the array comparing each element with the next:
     - If any element is less than the next one, set `isDecreasing` to `false`.
     - If any element is greater than the next one, set `isIncreasing` to `false`.
   - If either `isIncreasing` or `isDecreasing` remains `true` throughout, the array is monotonic.

### Code

```javascript
function isMonotonic(nums) {
    // Initial checks
    if (nums.length <= 1) {
        return true;
    }

    let isIncreasing = true;
    let isDecreasing = true;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            isDecreasing = false;
        }
        if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            isIncreasing = false;
        }
    }

    return isIncreasing || isDecreasing;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array exactly once in a single loop.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
