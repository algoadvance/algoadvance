[Leetcode 456. 132 Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l456)
### Problem Statement

**456. 132 Pattern**

Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-1, 3, 2, 0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are several 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2] and [-1, 3, 0].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to 2 * 10^4.
   - Each element in `nums` can be as large as 10^5 in absolute value.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array is non-empty as the problem constraints imply n (length of nums) is at least 1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack to maintain the candidate for the '2' value in the "132" pattern, while iterating through the array in reverse order to find a valid '1' and '3' value.

1. **Iterate from right to left:**
   - Maintain a variable `third` to keep track of the maximum possible value for nums[k], where `third` corresponds to nums[k] in the "132" pattern.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the potential candidates for the "3" value in the "132" pattern.

2. **For each number:**
   - If the current number is less than the `third`, then we have found a valid "132" pattern, and we can return `true`.
   - If not, we adjust `third` and the stack accordingly:
     - While the current number is greater than the top of the stack, keep popping from the stack (this means we have a valid "3" for the "132" pattern).
     - Push the current number onto the stack once the above condition is resolved.

3. **Return false if no "132" pattern is found by the end of the iteration.**

### Code

```javascript
function find132pattern(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 3) return false;

    let stack = [];
    let third = -Infinity;

    for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nums[i] < third) {
            return true;
        }
        while (stack.length > 0 && nums[i] > stack[stack.length - 1]) {
            third = stack.pop();
        }
        stack.push(nums[i]);
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm iterates through the array once in reverse (`O(n)`).
- The stack operations (push and pop) also happen in a total of `O(n)` time because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **`O(n)`**.
