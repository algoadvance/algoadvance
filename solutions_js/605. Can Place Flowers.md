[Leetcode 605. Can Place Flowers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l605)
### Problem Statement:
Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0s and 1s, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer `n`, return if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Example**:
   - Q: How can I represent the flowerbed in the input?
   - A: The flowerbed is represented as an array of integers, where 0 means an empty spot and 1 means a spot with a flower already planted. For example, `[1,0,0,0,1]`.
  
2. **Constraints**:
   - Q: Are there constraints on the length of the flowerbed array?
   - A: Yes, the length of the flowerbed array will be in the range of `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.
   - Q: Can `n` be greater than the length of the flowerbed?
   - A: It is possible but in such cases, the output will always be `false` since we can't plant more flowers than there are spots available.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Q: What if the flowerbed is empty?
   - A: The flowerbed array will not be empty as per the constraints.
   - Q: What if `n` is zero?
   - A: If `n` is zero, the function should immediately return `true` since no new flowers need to be planted.

### Code:

```javascript
function canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] === 0) {
            let prev = (i === 0) ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1];
            let next = (i === flowerbed.length - 1) ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1];
            if (prev === 0 && next === 0) {
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
                if (count >= n) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count >= n;
}
```

### Strategy:
1. **Iterate Through Flowerbed**:
   - Loop through the flowerbed array to check each position.
2. **Check for Valid Planting Spot**:
   - For each position `i` in the array:
     - Check if the current spot (`flowerbed[i]`) is 0.
     - Check if the previous spot (`flowerbed[i - 1]` if exists) is 0 or it's the beginning of the array.
     - Check if the next spot (`flowerbed[i + 1]` if exists) is 0 or it's the end of the array.
   - If all conditions are met, plant a flower (`flowerbed[i] = 1`), and increase the count of planted flowers.
3. **Early Termination**:
   - If at any point, the number of planted flowers `count` meets or exceeds `n`, return `true`.
4. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop finishes and `count` is still less than `n`, return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m)**: 
  - Here, `m` is the length of the `flowerbed` array.
  - We iterate through the flowerbed array once, making the time complexity linear relative to the input size.

This efficient solution ensures that we check each position only once and place flowers optimally without violating the given rules.
