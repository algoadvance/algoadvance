[Leetcode 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l448)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `1` to `n`, return an array of all the integers in the range `1` to `n` that do not appear in `nums`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the problem example itself contains duplicates.

2. **Is the input array guaranteed to have at least one missing number?**
   - No, not necessarily. It's possible that no numbers are missing.

3. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - By the problem definition, the length of the array `nums` is `n`, so it cannot be empty.

4. **Are there constraints on the runtime complexity?**
   - The optimal solution should aim for O(n) runtime complexity.

## Strategy
The objective here is to find numbers missing from a sequence within the range `[1, n]` in an array `nums` of length `n`. There are a few strategies, but we'll focus on a space-efficient and time-efficient approach using the input array itself for marking purposes.

### Algorithm
1. **Marking Phase:**
   - Iterate through the array and mark positions based on the value in the array.
   - For each number `num` in the array, set `nums[abs(num) - 1]` to negative if it's not already negative. This marks that the index `abs(num) - 1` was seen.
   
2. **Collection Phase:**
   - Iterate through the array again and collect indices that have positive values. These indices+1 represent the missing numbers.

### Steps:
1. Loop through the input array and for each value `num`, mark the value at index `abs(num) - 1` as negative.
2. Loop through the array again, and collect indices of positive values. These indices indicate the missing numbers.

### Example Walkthrough
For `nums = [4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 3, 1]`:
1. After marking phase:
   ```
   [-4, -3, -2, -7, 8, 2, -3, -1]
   ```
2. Collection phase:
   - The indices 4 and 5 (values 8 and 2) are positive, so the missing numbers are 5 and 6.

## Code Implementation
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findDisappearedNumbers = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    
    // Marking phase
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let index = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
        if (nums[index] > 0) {
            nums[index] = -nums[index];
        }
    }
    
    // Collection phase
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            result.push(i + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time and Space Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array twice.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space. The in-place modification of the input array is allowed.

This solution efficiently finds all missing numbers in the given range using minimal extra space and linear time complexity.
