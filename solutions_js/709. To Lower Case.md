[Leetcode 709. To Lower Case](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l709)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to implement a function that converts all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase letters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Hello"
Output: "hello"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "here"
Output: "here"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "LOVELY"
Output: "lovely"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of printable ASCII characters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any characters in the string other than English alphabet letters?
   - **A:** Yes, the string can include any printable ASCII characters, though only uppercase English letters need conversion.

2. **Q:** How should we handle already lowercase characters or non-alphabetic characters?
   - **A:** They should remain unchanged in the output.

3. **Q:** Should we use built-in string methods or consider an approach without them?
   - **A:** The problem can be solved with or without using built-in methods, but using a built-in method for simplicity is acceptable.

## Strategy

1. **Using Built-in Method:** 
   - JavaScript has a built-in method `toLowerCase()` for strings that can be directly used to convert all uppercase letters to lowercase.

2. **Without Built-in Method:**
   - Iterate through each character of the string.
   - For each character, check if it's an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z').
   - Convert it to lowercase by utilizing the character code manipulation.

## Code

### Using Built-in Method

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var toLowerCase = function(s) {
    return s.toLowerCase();
};
```

### Without Using Built-in Method

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var toLowerCase = function(s) {
    let result = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let charCode = s.charCodeAt(i);
        
        // If character is uppercase letter (A-Z), convert to lowercase
        if (charCode >= 65 && charCode <= 90) {
            result += String.fromCharCode(charCode + 32);
        } else {
            result += s[i];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Both Implementations:**
  - The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`, because we iterate through each character of the string exactly once.

Both approaches will perform well within the given constraints of the problem. Using the built-in `toLowerCase()` method is cleaner and more concise, but understanding the character code manipulation approach is also beneficial for deeper comprehension of the problem.
