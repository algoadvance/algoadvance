[Leetcode 2512. Reward Top K Students](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2512)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback`, each of length `n`, and an array `student_scores` of length `m`. Each student has a score based on the feedback. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to find the top `k` students based on their scores. In case of a tie, the student with the lower index should come first. Return the indices of the top `k` students sorted based on the aforementioned criteria.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes positive or negative feedback for a student?**
   - Positive feedback increases a student's score and negative feedback decreases it.

2. **Does each student's feedback score (positive or negative) come from one element in the respective arrays or is it a sum/combination of feedbacks?**
   - Each student's score is determined by summing up the positive and negative feedback value. It implies we might need to have a mechanism to sum up individual feedback effects.

3. **Are the feedback values always integers, and is their range specified?**
   - Yes, the feedback values are integers.

4. **Are `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback` mapped one-to-one with `student_scores`?**
   - Yes, each index in `positive_feedback` and `negative_feedback` corresponds to the same student's index in `student_scores`.

5. **What if `k` is greater than the number of students?**
   - We can assume that `k` will always be less than or equal to the number of students.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Total Scores**: Iterate through the index of the students and calculate the total score for each student based on their positive and negative feedback.

2. **Sort and Select Top K**: Sort the students based on their scores in descending order. In case of ties, rely on the original index order (which naturally happens since JavaScript's sort is stable).

3. **Select Top K**: Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted list to get the top `k` student indices.

### Code

```javascript
function rewardTopKStudents(positive_feedback, negative_feedback, student_scores, k) {
    const n = student_scores.length;
    
    // Calculate total scores
    let studentData = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let totalScore = student_scores[i] + positive_feedback[i] - negative_feedback[i];
        studentData.push({ index: i, score: totalScore });
    }

    // Sort by score in descending order, and by index in case of ties (stable sort)
    studentData.sort((a, b) => {
        if (b.score !== a.score) {
            return b.score - a.score; // Descending order by score
        } else {
            return a.index - b.index; // Ascending order by index when scores are the same
        }
    });

    // Collect top K indices
    return studentData.slice(0, k).map(student => student.index);
}

// Example usage:
const positive_feedback = [3, 9, 4, 6];
const negative_feedback = [1, 2, 3, 1];
const student_scores = [80, 95, 78, 85];
const k = 2;

console.log(rewardTopKStudents(positive_feedback, negative_feedback, student_scores, k)); // [1, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Calculating Scores**: O(n), where n is the number of students.
2. **Sorting**: O(n log n) due to the sort operation.
3. **Selecting Top K**: O(k) for slicing the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step. Insertion and score computation operations are linear in terms of time complexity.
