[Leetcode 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l825)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `ages`, where each integer represents someone's age. Your task is to determine the number of friend requests made among them.

**Constraints for making a friend request are as follows:**

- If `age[B]` is less than or equal to `0.5 * age[A] + 7`, a friend request will not be made from person A to person B.
- If `age[B]` is greater than `age[A]`, a friend request will not be made from person A to person B.
- If `age[B]` is greater than or equal to 100 and `age[A]` is less than 100, a friend request will not be made from person A to person B.

Given the `ages` array, your task is to return the total number of friend requests made.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the age values integers?
   **A:** Yes, the age values are integers.
   
2. **Q:** Can the `ages` array contain duplicate ages?
   **A:** Yes, the `ages` array can contain duplicate ages.

3. **Q:** Can the age values be zero or negative?
   **A:** No, age values are positive integers, typically within the range of human ages (1 to 120).

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the `ages` array and keep track of the count of each age.
2. Use these counts to iterate over all possible pairs of ages to determine whether a friend request can be made based on the given constraints.
3. Accumulate the total number of valid friend requests.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} ages
 * @return {number}
 */
function numFriendRequests(ages) {
    // Count the occurrences of each age
    const ageCount = new Array(121).fill(0);
    for (let age of ages) {
        ageCount[age]++;
    }
    
    let friendRequests = 0;
    
    // Evaluate friend requests
    for (let ageA = 1; ageA <= 120; ageA++) {
        if (ageCount[ageA] === 0) continue;
        
        for (let ageB = 1; ageB <= 120; ageB++) {
            if (ageCount[ageB] === 0 || ageB > ageA) continue;

            // Condition to check if A can send a friend request to B
            if (ageB <= 0.5 * ageA + 7) continue;
            
            let requestsFromAtoB = ageCount[ageA] * ageCount[ageB];
            if (ageA === ageB) {
                // If both ages are the same, subtract the self-request
                requestsFromAtoB -= ageCount[ageA];
            }
            friendRequests += requestsFromAtoB;
        }
    }
    
    return friendRequests;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Counting Ages:** O(n), where n is the length of the `ages` array.
- **Pair Evaluation:** O(120^2), which simplifies to O(1) as it is a constant operation given the fixed possible range of ages (1 to 120).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Explanation
1. **Count Occurrences:** Create an array `ageCount` to store the count of each age.
2. **Nested Loop:** Use nested loops to iterate through all possible age pairs.
   - Ensure that ageB is not greater than ageA.
   - Check if ageB satisfies the condition `ageB > 0.5 * ageA + 7`.
3. **Calculate Requests:** Calculate the friend requests between ageA and ageB, and add to the total count, ensuring to handle the case where ageA equals ageB by subtracting self-requests.
