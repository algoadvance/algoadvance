[Leetcode 1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1719)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1719: Number of Ways to Reconstruct a Tree

You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `xi` and `yi`. Notice that the nodes have no fixed values between 1 and `n`.

Pairs `[xi, yi]` and `[xi, yj]` are identical, meaning that they are the same undirected edge.

You need to return the **number of ways** to reconstruct a tree with `n` nodes from pairs. If there's an invalid solution, return `0`. If a unique solution exists, return `1`. If there are multiple ways to reconstruct the tree, return `2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the number of nodes `n`?**
   - This is typically derived from the pairs provided, but a constraint would be helpful for optimization considerations.

2. **Can we assume that edge pairs are always valid undirected edges (i.e., xi != yi and both xi and yi are within the valid node range)?**
   - Confirming this can simplify the problem.

3. **Is there any guarantee that the provided list of pairs is sufficient to form a connected tree (i.e., no isolated nodes)?**
   - This determines if we need to check for isolated nodes.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Construct an adjacency list from the given pairs. This helps represent the graph.

2. **Tree Validation**:
   - Check if the graph is a valid tree.
   - A valid tree must have `n-1` edges where `n` is the number of nodes.
   - It should also be connected, which can be checked using BFS/DFS.

3. **Unique Tree Construction**:
   - Determine the root and validate if thereâ€™s exactly one valid way to connect all nodes under given constraints.

### Code

```javascript
function checkWays(pairs) {
    const adj = new Map();
    
    // Build the adjacency list
    for (const [u, v] of pairs) {
        if (!adj.has(u)) adj.set(u, new Set());
        if (!adj.has(v)) adj.set(v, new Set());
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        adj.get(v).add(u);
    }

    let ways = 1;
    let seenRoot = false;
    
    for (const [node, neighbors] of adj) {
        // Getting collection of other sizes
        const neighborSizes = [...neighbors].map(neighbor => adj.get(neighbor).size);
        
        // If we see a root, it should have edges to all other nodes initially
        if (neighbors.size === adj.size - 1) seenRoot = true;
        
        const maxConnectedSize = Math.max(...neighborSizes, 0);
        if (maxConnectedSize > neighbors.size) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        let parentFound = false;
        for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
            if (adj.get(neighbor).size === maxConnectedSize) {
                parentFound = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (!parentFound) ways = 2;
    }
    
    return seenRoot ? ways : 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Constructing the graph** involves processing `pairs`, thus `O(M)` where M is the number of pairs.
- **Graph traversal and checks** will involve iterating through nodes and their neighbors, effectively `O(N + M)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N + M)`, where `N` is the number of nodes and `M` is the number of pairs.
