[Leetcode 1340. Jump Game V](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1340)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step, you can jump from index `i` to index `i + j` or `i - j` (where `1 <= j <= d`). However, you can only jump to index `i + j` or `i - j` if `arr[i] > arr[i + j]` and `arr[i] > arr[i - j]`. 

Return the maximum number of indices you can visit starting from any index.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can you jump out of bounds?**
   - No, jumps must stay within the bounds of the array.

2. **Can elements in the array be negative?**
   - No constraints suggest that the elements cannot be negative, so assume they can be negative.

3. **What if `d` is greater than the length of the array?**
   - It's guaranteed that `d` will be within a reasonable range compared to the array length.

4. **Are the jumps in both directions (left and right) always possible?**
   - No, you can only jump to an index with a smaller value than the current index.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Define a DP array:** Let's use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from index `i`.

2. **Recursive Function:** Define a recursive function `jump(i)` that computes the maximum reachable indices starting from index `i`.

3. **Memoization:** Use memoization to store results of `jump(i)` to avoid repeat calculations.

4. **Jump Logic:** For the current index `i`, try to jump to `i + j` and `i - j` for `1 <= j <= d`, ensuring jumps are within bounds and jumping to smaller elements.

5. **Return Result:** The result will be the max value in the `dp` array because we need to consider the best starting point.

### Code

```javascript
var maxJumps = function(arr, d) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(-1);

    function jump(i) {
        if (dp[i] !== -1) {
            return dp[i];
        }

        let maxReachable = 1;

        // Check forward jumps
        for (let j = 1; j <= d && i + j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[i + j]) break;
            maxReachable = Math.max(maxReachable, 1 + jump(i + j));
        }

        // Check backward jumps
        for (let j = 1; j <= d && i - j >= 0; j++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[i - j]) break;
            maxReachable = Math.max(maxReachable, 1 + jump(i - j));
        }

        dp[i] = maxReachable;
        return maxReachable;
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result = Math.max(result, jump(i));
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The recurrence relation calculates each element at most once and the checking of jumps is `O(d)` for each index. Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * d)`.
- **Space Complexity:** Additional space is used for the `dp` array and the call stack depth, resulting in `O(n)` space complexity.

This ensures a relatively efficient solution for problems of this nature, balancing both clarity and performance.
