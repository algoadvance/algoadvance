[Leetcode 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l84)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example:
```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The largest rectangle has an area = 10 units (5 and 6 with height 2).
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the minimum and maximum possible length of the `heights` array?
   - The array can have a minimum length of `1` and a maximum length defined by the problem constraints (usually up to `10^5`).
   
2. What are the possible values for the elements in `heights`?
   - Typically, the elements are non-negative integers. Specifically, they might range from `0` to a large positive number (decimal / integer according to problem constraints).

3. Will the array always contain at least one positive integer?
   - Although edge cases should be considered, typically the problem would deal with positive values. But handling `0` values ensures thorough consideration.

### Strategy:
1. **Using a Stack**:
    - Utilize a stack to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars.
    - Iterate through each bar, and ensure the stack maintains heights in a non-decreasing order.
    - Whenever a bar is found that is lower than the bar at the stack's top, calculate the area with the height of the index at the stack's top as the smallest (or minimum height) bar.
    - Pop from the stack and compute the area at each step.
    - To handle remaining bars in the stack after the loop ends, continue popping and calculating the areas.

This stack-based approach ensures an efficient way to determine the largest rectangle area in `O(n)` time complexity.

### Code:

```javascript
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
    let stack = [];
    let maxArea = 0;
    let index = 0;
    
    while (index < heights.length) {
        // Push index if stack is empty or current height is greater than height at the current stack's top index
        if (stack.length === 0 || heights[index] >= heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            stack.push(index++);
        } else {
            let topOfStack = stack.pop();
            let height = heights[topOfStack];
            let width = stack.length === 0 ? index : index - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
    }
    
    // Pop remaining bars from stack
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        let topOfStack = stack.pop();
        let height = heights[topOfStack];
        let width = stack.length === 0 ? index : index - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
    }
    
    return maxArea;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of bars in the histogram (since each bar is pushed and popped from the stack once).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the stack used to store indices.

In conclusion, the above stack-based approach efficiently determines the largest rectangle area in the histogram by managing heights in a non-decreasing order, ensuring optimal performance.
