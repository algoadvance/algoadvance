[Leetcode 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1414)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `k`. You need to find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to `k`. Each Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- `F1 = 1`
- `F2 = 1`
- `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2` for `n > 2`.

Find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of integer `k`?
   - The value of `k` is `1 <= k <= 10^9`.

2. Can we use the same Fibonacci number more than once?
   - Yes, each Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

3. Do we need to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to `k`?
   - Yes, we need sufficient Fibonacci numbers up to `k`.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves:

1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**:
    - Generate all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Greedy Algorithm**:
    - Use a greedy approach to find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers that sum up to `k`.
    - Start with the largest Fibonacci number and subtract it from `k` if it is less than or equal to `k`. Keep track of the count.
    - Repeat the process until `k` becomes zero.

## Code

```javascript
function findMinFibonacciNumbers(k) {
    // Generate all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to k
    let fibs = [1, 1];
    while (true) {
        let nextFib = fibs[fibs.length - 1] + fibs[fibs.length - 2];
        if (nextFib > k) break;
        fibs.push(nextFib);
    }

    let count = 0;
    // Process to find the minimum numbers of Fibonacci numbers
    for (let i = fibs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        while (k >= fibs[i]) {
            k -= fibs[i];
            count++;
        }
        if (k === 0) break;
    }

    return count;
}

// Test cases
console.log(findMinFibonacciNumbers(7));  // Output: 2 (2 + 5)
console.log(findMinFibonacciNumbers(10)); // Output: 2 (2 + 8)
console.log(findMinFibonacciNumbers(19)); // Output: 3 (1 + 5 + 13)
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: 
    - Let `f` be the number of Fibonacci numbers generated (until the largest one is less than `k`).
    - It takes `O(f)` time to generate all Fibonacci numbers up to `k`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Numbers**:
    - We iterate over the list of Fibonacci numbers in reverse, potentially using each `O(f)` operations.

Therefore, overall time complexity is `O(f)` where `f` is the number of Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `k`. 
Since each Fibonacci number grows exponentially, the number of Fibonacci numbers up to `k` is logarithmic in terms of `k`, making it efficient for large values of `k`.
