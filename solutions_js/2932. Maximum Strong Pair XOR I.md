[Leetcode 2932. Maximum Strong Pair XOR I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2932)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of non-negative integers `arr`, you are required to find two distinct elements `a` and `b` from the array such that their XOR value (`a XOR b`) is maximized. Return the maximum XOR value obtained.

### Function Signature
```javascript
function findMaximumXOR(arr) {
   // your code here
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   - The array size can range from very small (1-2 elements) to very large (up to \(10^5\) elements).

2. **What are the constraints on the elements of the array?**
   - The elements in the array are non-negative integers. Typically, these will fit within a 32-bit integer range.

3. **Can the input array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain duplicates.

4. **What should be returned if the array has fewer than two elements?**
   - Since there are no two distinct elements in such cases, returning 0 (or an appropriate indication) would be acceptable.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, the naive approach of checking every possible pair to find the maximum XOR value would be computationally expensive with a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). 

A more efficient approach involves using a Trie (prefix tree) data structure to compute the XOR for pairs of numbers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Trie Construction:** 
   - Insert each number in the array into a binary Trie where each node represents a bit (0 or 1).

2. **Maximizing XOR:**
   - For each number in the array, traverse the Trie to find the number that maximizes the XOR value.

## Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class TrieNode {
    constructor() {
        this.children = {};
    }
}

class Trie {
    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    add(num) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (let i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            let bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (!(bit in node.children)) {
                node.children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[bit];
        }
    }
    
    findMaximumXORFor(num) {
        let node = this.root;
        let maxXOR = 0;
        for (let i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            let bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            let toggleBit = bit ^ 1;
            if (toggleBit in node.children) {
                maxXOR = (maxXOR << 1) | 1;
                node = node.children[toggleBit];
            } else {
                maxXOR = maxXOR << 1;
                node = node.children[bit];
            }
        }
        return maxXOR;
    }
}

function findMaximumXOR(arr) {
    if (arr.length < 2) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const trie = new Trie();
    let maxResult = 0;
    
    trie.add(arr[0]);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        maxResult = Math.max(maxResult, trie.findMaximumXORFor(arr[i]));
        trie.add(arr[i]);
    }
    
    return maxResult;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insert Operation in Trie:** O(32) per number, since the numbers are represented with up to 32-bit binary.
- **Query Operation in Trie:** O(32) per number for finding maximum XOR.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n * 32) which simplifies to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. 

This optimized approach is efficient enough to handle large inputs within the provided constraints.
