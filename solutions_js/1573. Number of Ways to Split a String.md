### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1573: Number of Ways to Split a String

Given a binary string `s` (a string containing only characters '0' and '1'), you can split `s` into three non-empty parts `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` such that:

- `s1` + `s2` + `s3` == `s`

Return the number of ways `s` can be split into three parts such that all three parts have an equal number of '1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the parts `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` required to be contiguous within the string?
   - Yes, they must be contiguous sub-parts of the string `s`.

2. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - The maximum length of the string `s` is 10^5.

3. What should be returned if there are no ways to split the string satisfying the conditions?
   - Return `0` if no valid splits are possible.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Total Number of '1's**: If the total number of '1's is not divisible by 3, we cannot split the string as required.
2. **Partitioning**: Find positions where strings can be partitioned so that each part has the same number of '1's.
3. **Calculate Splits**: Calculate the number of ways to split the string into three parts with equal '1's by counting the valid gaps between partitions.

### Steps

1. Count the total number of '1's in the string.
2. If the count of '1's is not divisible by 3, return 0.
3. If there are no '1's, use the combinatorial approach to determine the number of ways to split a string of zeros.
4. Find indices where valid splits can happen, then calculate the number of ways to split based on these indices.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the proposed solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, since we need to traverse the string a constant number of times to gather necessary information and compute the result.

### Code

```javascript
function numWays(s) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const totalOnes = [...s].reduce((acc, char) => acc + (+char), 0);

    // If total number of '1's is not divisible by 3, return 0
    if (totalOnes % 3 !== 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // If there are no '1's at all
    if (totalOnes === 0) {
        const n = s.length;
        // Combination of n-1 choose 2 i.e. (n-1)*(n-2)/2
        return ((n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2) % MOD;
    }

    const onesPerPart = totalOnes / 3;
    let firstCutOptions = 0, secondCutOptions = 0;
    let countOnes = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            countOnes++;
        }

        if (countOnes === onesPerPart) {
            firstCutOptions++;
        } else if (countOnes === 2 * onesPerPart) {
            secondCutOptions++;
        }
    }

    return (firstCutOptions * secondCutOptions) % MOD;
}
```

This code correctly counts the number of ways to split the binary string `s` into three parts each containing an equal number of '1's, efficiently handling the constraints.
