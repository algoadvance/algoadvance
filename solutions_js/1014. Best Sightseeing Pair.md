## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1014: Best Sightseeing Pair

Given an array of positive integers `values`, where `values[i]` represents the value of the `i`-th sightseeing spot, compute the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots such that the score of the pair `(i, j)` is calculated using the following formula:
\[ \text{score}(i, j) = \text{values}[i] + \text{values}[j] + i - j \]
where \( i < j \).

You need to return the maximum score that can be obtained from a pair of sightseeing spots.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are the elements in the values array all positive integers?**
   - A: Yes, all elements are positive integers.

2. **Q: Is the array `values` guaranteed to have at least two elements?**
   - A: Yes, you can assume the array has at least two elements.

3. **Q: Can the indices i and j be the same?**
   - A: No, \( i \) must be less than \( j \).

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Reformulate**:
    - We can split the problem into two parts:
      \[ \text{score}(i, j) = \text{values}[i] + i + \text{values}[j] - j \]
    - This allows us to split the score into:
      \[ \text{score}(i, j) = (\text{values}[i] + i) + (\text{values}[j] - j) \]

2. **Iterate** through the array while keeping track of the maximum value of `values[i] + i` encountered so far.
3. **Calculate** the potential maximum score for each `values[j] - j` as we iterate through the array.

This approach takes linear time, O(n), since we only make a single pass through the array.

## Code

```javascript
function maxScoreSightseeingPair(values) {
    // Initialize variables
    let maxScore = 0;
    let maxValuePlusIndex = values[0] + 0;

    // Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for (let j = 1; j < values.length; j++) {
        // Calculate the current score with the given j
        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, maxValuePlusIndex + values[j] - j);
        
        // Update maxValuePlusIndex for the next iteration
        maxValuePlusIndex = Math.max(maxValuePlusIndex, values[j] + j);
    }

    return maxScore;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `values` array. This is because we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum score of sightseeing pairs in linear time, adhering to optimal time and space complexity.
