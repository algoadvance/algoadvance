[Leetcode 1002. Find Common Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1002)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of strings `words`, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

### Example:
#### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if the input list is empty?**
   - If the input list is empty, the result should be an empty list.
2. **What should be done if one of the strings in the input list is empty?**
   - If one of the strings is empty, the result should be an empty list since there cannot be any characters common in all strings.
3. **Can the input contain non-lowercase characters or special characters?**
   - No, you can assume that the input strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Strategy
1. Initialize an array `commonCount` with the length of 26 (corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet). Populate it with `Infinity` to represent the maximum possible occurrence counts.
2. Traverse each word in the list and count the frequency of each character.
3. For each character, update `commonCount` to the minimum count of that character observed in all words so far.
4. After processing all words, generate the result list based on `commonCount`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. Initialize a `commonCount` array with `Infinity`.
2. Iterate through each word:
   - Create a count array for the current word.
   - For each character, increment the corresponding position in the count array.
   - Update the `commonCount` array by taking the minimum of the existing count and the current word count for each character.
3. Create the result list by repeating characters based on the final `commonCount`.

## Code
```javascript
function commonChars(words) {
    // Initialize `commonCount` array with infinity
    const commonCount = new Array(26).fill(Infinity);
    
    for (const word of words) {
        // Initialize `currentCount` array for the current word
        const currentCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
        
        // Count each character in the current word
        for (const char of word) {
            currentCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        
        // Update the `commonCount` array
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            commonCount[i] = Math.min(commonCount[i], currentCount[i]);
        }
    }
    
    // Create the result array based on `commonCount`
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        // If `commonCount[i]` is infinity, it means the character was not found in any word.
        const count = commonCount[i];
        if (count !== Infinity) {
            for (let j = 0; j < count; j++) {
                result.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 'a'.charCodeAt(0)));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(commonChars(["bella","label","roller"])); // Output: ["e","l","l"]
console.log(commonChars(["cool","lock","cook"]));     // Output: ["c","o"]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * k), where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the maximum length of a word. This is because we iterate over each word and then each character within the word.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since the space used for the `commonCount` and `currentCount` arrays does not depend on the input size.
