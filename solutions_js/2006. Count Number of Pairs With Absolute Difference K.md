[Leetcode 2006. Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2006)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are indices of the array such that `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k` and `i != j`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   Typically, interview problems like these assume you handle arrays of reasonable sizes.
   
2. **Are the elements of `nums` positive, negative, or zero?**
   This can affect the solution if special cases are created by negative numbers or zeros.

3. **Can `k` be zero?**
   If yes, then `(i, j)` should be pairs of the same numbers but at different indices.

### Strategy
We'll solve this problem by iterating through the array and using a hashmap (object) to store the counts of each number. We can then compute the required pairs by checking how many times `(nums[i] + k)` and `(nums[i] - k)` have appeared previously as we iterate through the array.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each number as we iterate through the array.
2. Initialize a counter for storing the number of valid pairs.
3. For each number in the array, check if there is a counterpart that forms a pair `(num[i] + k)` or `(num[i] - k)` using the hashmap.
4. Update the hashmap with the current number's count.
5. Return the count of valid pairs.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function countKDifference(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    let numCounts = {};

    for (let num of nums) {
        // Count pairs where num - k or num + k exists already
        if (numCounts[num - k] !== undefined) {
            count += numCounts[num - k];
        }
        if (numCounts[num + k] !== undefined) {
            count += numCounts[num + k];
        }

        // Update the frequency of the current num
        if (numCounts[num] === undefined) {
            numCounts[num] = 1;
        } else {
            numCounts[num]++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(n)** for iterating through the array once.
- **O(1)** for the constant time operations of checking and updating the hashmap.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This solution is efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
