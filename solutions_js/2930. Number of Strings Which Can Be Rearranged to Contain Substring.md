[Leetcode 2930. Number of Strings Which Can Be Rearranged to Contain Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2930)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `sub`. You need to find the number of substrings of `s` that can be rearranged to exactly match the substring `sub`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity:** Should we consider case sensitivity while matching substrings?
2. **Characters Uniqueness:** Can `sub` and `s` contain duplicate characters?
3. **Length Constraints:** What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `sub`?
4. **Input Validation:** Should we handle cases where `sub` is longer than `s`?

Assuming the default behavior:
- The match is case-sensitive.
- The input strings may contain duplicate characters.
- We assume `s` and `sub` meet the constraints typically provided by LeetCode problems (reasonable length for efficient computation).

### Strategy

1. **Character Count:** We need to count characters in `sub`.
2. **Sliding Window:** Use a sliding window of size equal to the length of `sub` to traverse `s` and compare character counts within the window:
   - If the character counts of a substring of `s` match that of `sub`, it indicates that this substring can be rearranged to form `sub`.
3. **Efficiency:** By maintaining a map (or object in JavaScript) to track character counts in the current window, updating the count by adding the new character and removing the old one entering and exiting the window, we can achieve optimal performance.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
var numOfSubstrsRearrangedToContainSubstring = function(s, sub) {
    const subLength = sub.length;
    const sLength = s.length;

    if (subLength > sLength) return 0;

    const createCharCountMap = (str) => {
        let map = {};
        for (let char of str) {
            map[char] = (map[char] || 0) + 1;
        }
        return map;
    };

    const areMapsEqual = (map1, map2) => {
        if (Object.keys(map1).length !== Object.keys(map2).length) return false;
        for (let key in map1) {
            if (map1[key] !== map2[key]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    const subCharCountMap = createCharCountMap(sub);
    let windowCharCountMap = createCharCountMap(s.slice(0, subLength));

    let count = 0;
    if (areMapsEqual(subCharCountMap, windowCharCountMap)) {
        count++;
    }

    for (let i = subLength; i < sLength; i++) {
        const startChar = s[i - subLength];
        const endChar = s[i];
        
        windowCharCountMap[startChar]--;
        if (windowCharCountMap[startChar] === 0) {
            delete windowCharCountMap[startChar];
        }
        windowCharCountMap[endChar] = (windowCharCountMap[endChar] || 0) + 1;

        if (areMapsEqual(subCharCountMap, windowCharCountMap)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing:** Creating the character count map for `sub` and the initial window of `s` takes `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of `sub`.
- **Sliding Window:** For each character in `s` (total `s.length` characters), we:
  - Update the window character count map in constant time, `O(1)`.
  - Compare the two maps, which in the worst-case involves checking up to the total number of unique characters.
Thus, the overall complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `s`, assuming the character set to be reasonably small (e.g., all lowercase letters).

This ensures the solution is efficient and scalable within typical LeetCode constraints.
