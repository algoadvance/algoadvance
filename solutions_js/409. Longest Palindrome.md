[Leetcode 409. Longest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l409)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
     - The maximum length of `s` is 2000.
   
2. **Output:**
   - We need to return an integer representing the length of the longest possible palindromic substring we can form with the given characters.

Is that correct? If so, let's proceed.

### Strategy

To form the longest palindrome:
- A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
- Characters must have pairs to be symmetrical around the center.
- We can use all even-count characters completely in pairs.
- If any characters have an odd count, we can use the largest group of each one, minus one, to make them even (and thus palindromic).
- We can center the palindrome with only one character if we have any characters with an odd frequency.

### Implementation Steps

1. Use a hashmap or object to count occurrences of each character.
2. Iterate through the counts:
   - Add the largest even number less than or equal to the count, for each character.
   - Track if there's at least one character with an odd count to allow one odd character in the center.
3. Return the accumulated count.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestPalindrome(s) {
  let charCount = {};

  // Count the frequency of each character
  for (let char of s) {
    if (charCount[char]) {
      charCount[char]++;
    } else {
      charCount[char] = 1;
    }
  }

  let length = 0;
  let oddFound = false;

  // Calculate the length of the longest palindrome
  for (let count of Object.values(charCount)) {
    if (count % 2 === 0) {
      length += count;
    } else {
      length += count - 1;  // Add the even part of the odd count
      oddFound = true;  // Mark that we found an odd count
    }
  }

  // Add one for the center character if there was any odd count
  if (oddFound) {
    length += 1;
  }

  return length;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Counting characters takes O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- Iterating over the character counts also takes O(m), where `m` is the number of unique characters. Since `m` is limited by the size of the alphabet (which is constant), we can treat it as O(1).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
