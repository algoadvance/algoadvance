[Leetcode 1515. Best Position for a Service Centre](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1515)
### Problem Statement

You are establishing a service center and want to minimize the maximum distance between the service center and any of the given houses (with the house positions given as coordinates on a 2D plane). The goal is to determine the best position for the service center so that the maximum distance from any house to the service center is minimized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input**: Are the coordinates of the houses given as an array of arrays, for example, `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]`?
2. **Output**: Should the answer be the coordinates of the service center that minimizes the maximum distance?
3. **Constraints**: Is there a maximum number of houses we need to consider, and are the coordinates limited to particular ranges?

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - Minimize the maximum distance from the service center to any house.
   - The service center can be placed anywhere on the 2D plane.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The problem translates to finding the geometric median (or Fermat-Weber point) of a set of points, which minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances from the point to the given coordinates.
   - This is a classic optimization problem in the context of geometry.

3. **Gradient Descent**:
   - Use a heuristic optimization method like gradient descent to approximate the location of the service center since an exact analytical solution might not be feasible.
   - Initialize the service center at an arbitrary point (e.g., the centroid of given points).
   - Gradually adjust the position to reduce the maximum distance to any of the houses.
   - Use a sufficiently small step size to ensure precision.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation using gradient descent:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} positions
 * @return {number}
 */
function getMinDistSum(positions) {
    // Helper function to calculate total distance
    function totalDistance(x, y) {
        let dist = 0;
        for (let [px, py] of positions) {
            dist += Math.sqrt((px - x) ** 2 + (py - y) ** 2);
        }
        return dist;
    }
    
    // Initial guess for the center is the centroid of all positions
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    const n = positions.length;
    for (let [px, py] of positions) {
        x += px;
        y += py;
    }
    x /= n;
    y /= n;
    
    // Gradient descent parameters
    let move = 1;
    let epsilon = 1e-7;
    let delta = 0.98;
    let minDist = totalDistance(x, y);
    
    // Array to help search in all directions
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    
    while (move > epsilon) {
        let improved = false;
        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            let nx = x + dx * move;
            let ny = y + dy * move;
            let dist = totalDistance(nx, ny);
            if (dist < minDist) {
                minDist = dist;
                x = nx;
                y = ny;
                improved = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!improved) {
            move *= delta;  // Reduce the step size
        }
    }
    
    return minDist;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the total distance for each iteration = \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of positions.
- The outer loop will depend on the precision required and the gradient descent parameters, potentially leading to large, but often manageable, iteration counts.

In practice, the gradient descent approach might terminate in a reasonable number of iterations due to the gradual reduction in step size (`move *= delta`).

### Summary

- The algorithm uses an optimization technique grounded in gradient descent to find a near-optimal location for the service center.
- The process iteratively adjusts the location, reducing the step size until convergence.
- This method provides a high precision approximation while balancing computational feasibility.
