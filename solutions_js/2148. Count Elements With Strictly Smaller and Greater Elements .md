[Leetcode 2148. Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2148)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. Count the number of elements in `nums` that have both strictly smaller and strictly greater elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - The size of the array is denoted by `n`, and typically, it ranges from `1` to `10^5`.

2. **What about the range of the elements within the array?**
   - Each element in the array can range from `-10^6` to `10^6`.

3. **What should be the output if the array has less than three elements?**
   - If there are fewer than three elements, the output should be `0` because it's impossible to have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element.

### Strategy
Given the constraints and problem requirements, let's outline our strategy:

1. **Identify Edge Cases**:
   - If the length of `nums` is less than 3, return `0` immediately.
   
2. **Find Minimum and Maximum**:
   - Identify the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

3. **Count Valid Elements**:
   - Traverse the array and count elements that are strictly greater than the minimum and strictly smaller than the maximum.

### Code

```javascript
const countElements = (nums) => {
    // If the number of elements is less than 3, return 0
    if (nums.length < 3) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Find the minimum and maximum elements in the array
    const min = Math.min(...nums);
    const max = Math.max(...nums);

    // Count the elements that are greater than min and less than max
    let count = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > min && num < max) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding Minimum and Maximum**:
  - Both `Math.min(...nums)` and `Math.max(...nums)` traverse the array once. So, for these operations: `O(n)`.

- **Counting Valid Elements**:
  - Another traversal of the array to count elements that meet the condition. This is also `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of our solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

### Example

```javascript
console.log(countElements([11, 7, 2, 15])); // Output: 2
console.log(countElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 3
console.log(countElements([1, 2])); // Output: 0
```
