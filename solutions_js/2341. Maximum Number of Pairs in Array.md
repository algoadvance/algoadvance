[Leetcode 2341. Maximum Number of Pairs in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2341)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can choose two equal indices `i` and `j` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i!=j`, remove the pair `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` from nums; the remaining elements of `nums` will be concatenated together.

Your task is to return a 0-indexed integer array `result` of length 2 where:

- `result[0]` is the maximum number of pairs that can be removed from `nums`.
- `result[1]` is the number of leftover elements in `nums` after the maximum number of pairs are removed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the array `nums`? 
   - The array can contain a large number of elements, and each element can be any integer within a typical range used for interview questions.
2. Can the array have negative numbers or only non-negative numbers?
   - The array can contain both negative and non-negative numbers.
3. Should the leftover elements retain their original order in the array?
   - The leftover elements' order is not important, just the count.

### Strategy

1. Use a frequency map to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. Use these frequencies to calculate:
   - The maximum number of pairs that can be formed for each unique element.
   - The remaining number of elements that cannot be paired.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfPairs(nums) {
    const frequency = new Map();
    
    // Build frequency map
    for (let num of nums) {
        frequency.set(num, (frequency.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    let pairs = 0;
    let leftovers = 0;
    
    // Calculate pairs and leftovers
    for (let count of frequency.values()) {
        pairs += Math.floor(count / 2);
        if (count % 2 !== 0) {
            leftovers++;
        }
    }
    
    return [pairs, leftovers];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfPairs([1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2])); // Output: [3, 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Frequency Map:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Calculating Result:** O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Since `k` is at most `n`, the total time complexity is O(n). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage used by the frequency map.
