[Leetcode 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1319)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` and a 2D integer array `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` indicates there is a connection between computers `a` and `b`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through some connections.

Return the minimum number of times you need to add a connection to make all the computers connected. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n` and the length of `connections`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= connections.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^5)`
   - `connections[i].length == 2`
   - `0 <= a, b < n`
   - `a != b`

2. **Can there be duplicate connections in the input?**
   - No, each connection is unique as given by the constraints.

3. **Do we need bi-directional connections to consider two computers directly connected?**
   - Yes, the connections are undirected edges between computers.

### Strategy

#### 1. Initial Checks
- If the number of connections is less than `n-1`, return `-1` immediately because it's impossible to connect all computers.

#### 2. Graph Representation
- Create an adjacency list to represent the graph of computers and connections.

#### 3. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Use DFS or BFS to count the number of connected components in the graph.

#### 4. Calculate Minimum Operations
- The minimum number of operations to connect the entire network equals the number of additional connections needed, which is the number of connected components minus one.

### Code

```javascript
function makeConnected(n, connections) {
    if (connections.length < n - 1) {
        return -1;
    }

    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);

    for (let [a, b] of connections) {
        adjList[a].push(b);
        adjList[b].push(a);
    }

    let visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let components = 0;

    const dfs = (node) => {
        visited[node] = true;
        for (let neighbor of adjList[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor);
            }
        }
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            components++;
            dfs(i);
        }
    }

    return components - 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: O(E), where E is the number of connections.
- **DFS Traversal**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (computers) and E is the number of edges (connections).
- **Overall Complexity**: O(V + E), which is efficient for the constraints provided.

This approach ensures that we only perform the necessary computations to determine how to connect all computers with the minimal number of additional operations.
