[Leetcode 998. Maximum Binary Tree II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l998)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer `val`, you need to insert the integer `val` into the tree such that the resultant tree still holds the properties of a maximum binary tree.

A maximum binary tree is defined as:

1. The root is the maximum number in the array.
2. The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the elements on the left side of the maximum number.
3. The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the elements on the right side of the maximum number.

Return the root of the maximum binary tree after inserting `val`.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]

Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]

Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `-100 <= val <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the tree be empty?
   **A**: Yes, if the tree is empty, the new node will become the root of the tree.
   
2. **Q**: Can `val` be any value?
   **A**: `val` will follow the given constraints, i.e., `-100 <= val <= +100`.

3. **Q**: Can we assume that the provided tree is always a valid maximum binary tree?
   **A**: Yes, you can assume that the input tree is always a valid maximum binary tree.

## Strategy

To insert `val` into the maximum binary tree while preserving its properties, follow the steps:

1. **New Root Check**: If `val` is greater than the rootâ€™s value, `val` will become the new root, and the entire existing tree becomes its left child.
2. **Traverse the Tree**: Otherwise, traverse the right subtree until you find a suitable position for `val`. Specifically, you need to find the first node where `val` is greater than the current node's right child. Insert `val` at that position, making the previous right child of that position the left child of the new node.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var insertIntoMaxTree = function(root, val) {
    let newNode = new TreeNode(val);
    
    if (root === null) return newNode;
    
    if (val > root.val) {
        newNode.left = root;
        return newNode;
    }
    
    let current = root;
    while (current.right !== null && current.right.val > val) {
        current = current.right;
    }
    
    newNode.left = current.right;
    current.right = newNode;
    
    return root;
};

// Example usage:
// Construct the tree [4, 1, 3, null, null, 2]
let root = new TreeNode(4);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(2);
let val = 5;

let newRoot = insertIntoMaxTree(root, val);
console.log(JSON.stringify(newRoot));  // [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case (New Root)**: `O(1)`, when `val` is greater than the root's value.
- **Worst Case (Deep Right Subtree)**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This occurs when `val` needs to be inserted at the bottom of a right-skewed tree.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(N)` in the worst case.
