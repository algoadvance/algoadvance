[Leetcode 1025. Divisor Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1025)
### Problem Statement:
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

1. Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.
2. Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game assuming both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of the integer `n`?
    - Typically, constraints are provided like `1 <= n <= 1000` or something similar. Assuming here is reasonable.
2. Is `n` always a positive integer?
    - It is implied in the problem statement with `0 < x < n`.

### Strategy:
The game can be solved using mathematical insights related to parity (even and odd properties of numbers).

1. If `n` is even, Alice can always subtract 1, making `n` odd for Bob.
2. If `n` is odd, the only possible moves will result in an even number for Alice.

When Alice starts with an even number, she can end up making Bob face an odd number. Alice can keep forcing Bob into positions where he has less optimal choices.

Key Insight:
- Alice wins if `n` is even.
- Bob wins if `n` is odd.

### Code:
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var divisorGame = function(n) {
    return n % 2 === 0;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` since it only involves a single modulo operation and a comparison, both of which are constant-time operations.

This efficient solution leverages mathematical insights to solve the problem in constant time, avoiding the need for more complex and less efficient approaches such as simulation or dynamic programming.
