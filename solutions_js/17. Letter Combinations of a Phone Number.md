[Leetcode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l17)
### Problem Statement
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The mapping of digits to letters is as follows (just like on the telephone buttons):

```
2: "abc", 3: "def", 4: "ghi", 5: "jkl", 6: "mno", 7: "pqrs", 8: "tuv", 9: "wxyz"
```
Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example:**
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should the function return if the input string is empty?
   - **A:** An empty list.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - **A:** We assume a reasonable length constraint such as `0 <= digits.length <= 4`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use backtracking to explore all possible combinations recursively:
1. **Mapping Setup:** First, we'll set up a mapping from digits to their corresponding letters.
2. **Backtracking Approach:** We'll define a backtracking function to attempt to build combinations:
   - If the current combination's length is equal to the input digits' length, we add the combination to the result list.
   - Otherwise, for each letter corresponding to the current digit, we add the letter to the current combination and call the function recursively for the next digit.
3. **Base Cases:** Handle base cases where input is an empty string.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation following the proposed strategy:

```javascript
function letterCombinations(digits) {
    if (digits.length === 0) return [];
    
    const digitToLetters = {
        '2': 'abc',
        '3': 'def',
        '4': 'ghi',
        '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno',
        '7': 'pqrs',
        '8': 'tuv',
        '9': 'wxyz'
    };
    
    const result = [];
    
    function backtrack(index, currentCombination) {
        if (index === digits.length) {
            result.push(currentCombination.join(''));
            return;
        }
        
        const letters = digitToLetters[digits[index]];
        for (const letter of letters) {
            currentCombination.push(letter);
            backtrack(index + 1, currentCombination);
            currentCombination.pop();
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(0, []);
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(letterCombinations("23"));  // Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(3^N \* 4^M)**:
- **N** is the number of digits that map to 3 letters.
- **M** is the number of digits that map to 4 letters.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also **O(3^N \* 4^M)** due to the storage requirements of the output list and the recursion stack.
