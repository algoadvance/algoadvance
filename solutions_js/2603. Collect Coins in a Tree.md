[Leetcode 2603. Collect Coins in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2603)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree (an undirected, connected, acyclic graph) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` represents the number of coins that are located at node `i`. The edges of the tree are given as a 2D array `edges` of size `(n - 1) Ã— 2` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` represents an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

You are also given a `start` node `s`. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to collect all the coins starting from the start node `s`, under the condition that you can only walk one step at a time from one node to a directly connected node.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4`
- `0 <= coins[i] <= 1`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= u_i, v_i < n`
- `0 <= s < n`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is meant by "steps"?** 
   - A step is a movement from one node to another connected directly by an edge.
2. **Collecting coins:** 
   - Once a coin is collected from a node, it doesn't need to be re-visited for further collection.
3. **Do all the nodes contain coins?**
   - No, coins can be `0` or `1` at any node.
4. **Is it necessary to return to the start node after collecting all coins?**
   - No, it's not mentioned.

With the above clarifications, let's proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Use DFS starting from node `s` to traverse the tree and calculate the minimum steps required to collect all the coins.
3. **Sub-tree Check:**
   - When checking each node, recursively calculate if the subtree rooted at that node contains any coins.
   - If it does, those coins must be collected, and the steps to return to that node after collecting coins from all children must be calculated.
4. **Accumulated Steps:**
   - The steps to collect coins in sub-trees must be accumulated correctly, considering the steps needed to go back to the parent node.

Here is the DFS-based solution:

## Code

```javascript
function collectTheCoins(coins, edges, s) {
    const n = coins.length;
    const adj = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);

    // Build the adjacency list
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adj[u].push(v);
        adj[v].push(u);
    }

    let steps = 0;

    function dfs(node, parent) {
        let needToCollect = coins[node] == 1;
        for (const neighbor of adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            const childNeeds = dfs(neighbor, node);
            if (childNeeds) {
                // If there are coins in the subtree rooted at neighbor, add steps to get those coins
                steps += 2; 
                needToCollect = true;
            }
        }
        return needToCollect;
    }

    // Start DFS from the starting node
    dfs(s, -1);
    
    return steps;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the adjacency list:** O(n)
- **DFS Traversal:** O(n)

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** due to the efficient tree traversal using DFS.

This solution should efficiently handle the constraints with `n` up to `3 * 10^4`.
