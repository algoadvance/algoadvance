[Leetcode 2400. Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2400)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers `startPos` and `endPos` representing the starting and ending positions on an infinite number line. You are also given an integer `k` representing the number of steps you can take. Each step, you can either move to the left or to the right by 1 unit. 

Determine the number of distinct ways to reach `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can `startPos` and `endPos` be negative?
   **A**: Yes, they can both be negative.
2. **Q**: What is the range of the integer `k`?
   **A**: Typically, for LeetCode problems, you can assume `k` can be up to a reasonable large positive integer, often around 10^5.
3. **Q**: Can `k` be such that it's impossible to reach `endPos` from `startPos`?
   **A**: Yes, `k` can be such that it's impossible to reach the destination. For example, if the difference in positions isn't even and `k` is even, it would be impossible.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming with memoization. We define a recursive function that tries both possible moves (left and right) from the current position.

#### Steps:
1. Define a helper function `rec(pos, steps_remaining)`:
   - If `steps_remaining` is 0, check if `pos` equals `endPos`.
   - If `steps_remaining` is negative, return 0 (this path is invalid as we can't have negative steps).
2. Recursively compute the number of ways from the `pos - 1` and `pos + 1` with `steps_remaining - 1`.
3. Memoize the results to avoid recomputation.
4. Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Code
```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

const numberOfWays = (startPos, endPos, k) => {
  const memo = new Map();

  const rec = (pos, steps_remaining) => {
    if (steps_remaining === 0) return pos === endPos ? 1 : 0;
    if (steps_remaining < 0) return 0;

    const key = `${pos},${steps_remaining}`;
    if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);

    const left = rec(pos - 1, steps_remaining - 1);
    const right = rec(pos + 1, steps_remaining - 1);

    const result = (left + right) % MOD;
    memo.set(key, result);

    return result;
  };

  return rec(startPos, k);
};

// Example Usage
console.log(numberOfWays(1, 2, 3));  // Expected output: 3
console.log(numberOfWays(0, 5, 10)); // Expected output: 252
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(k * (2k + 1))` due to memoization, where `2k + 1` accounts for the range of possible positions we can reach within `k` steps. Although seemingly complex, this function reduces repetitive calculations significantly.

Given that `k` can be up to \(10^5\), this approach should be efficient for the constraints typically expected in such problems.
