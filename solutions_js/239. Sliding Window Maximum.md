[Leetcode 239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l239)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums`, and an integer `k` representing the size of the sliding window. Your task is to return the maximum values in each sliding window of size `k`.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3 -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3 -1 -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1 -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3 -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3 -1 -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3 -1 -3  5 [3  6  7]       7
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be returned if the input list is empty?
   **A:** You should return an empty list if the input list is empty.
   
2. **Q:** Can `k` be greater than the length of the input list?
   **A:** No, `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of the input list.
   
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?
   **A:** Yes, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`. Also, `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the indices of the elements in the current window in a way that the first element of the deque is always the largest. This way, for each window, the largest element can be obtained in O(1) time.

We can follow these steps:
1. Use a deque to store indices of elements.
2. Iterate through each element in the list.
3. For each element, remove indices from the back of the deque if the corresponding element in `nums` is less than or equal to the current element.
4. Add the current element's index to the deque.
5. Remove the front of the deque if it's outside the window.
6. Append the maximum (element at the front of the deque) to the result once the first window is formed.

### Code
```javascript
function maxSlidingWindow(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const result = [];
    const deque = [];
  
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Remove indices that are out of the bounds of the sliding window
        while (deque.length > 0 && deque[0] < i - k + 1) {
            deque.shift();
        }

        // Maintain elements in deque in decreasing order
        while (deque.length > 0 && nums[deque[deque.length - 1]] <= nums[i]) {
            deque.pop();
        }

        // Add current element index to the deque
        deque.push(i);
        
        // Append the maximum for this window to the result
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            result.push(nums[deque[0]]);
        }
    }
  
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxSlidingWindow([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3)); // Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once. Hence, the operations inside the loop all run in constant time.
