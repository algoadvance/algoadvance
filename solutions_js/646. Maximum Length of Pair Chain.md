[Leetcode 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l646)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` pairs `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [left_i, right_i]` and `left_i < right_i`.

A pair `(c, d)` can follow another pair `(a, b)` if and only if `b < c`. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return the length of the longest chain which can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the size of the input array?**
   - A: The size `n` can vary, but typically you should assume it to be reasonably large to test the efficiency of the solution.

2. **Q: Will the pairs be given in sorted order?**
   - A: No, the pairs can be in any arbitrary order.

3. **Q: Are there any constraints on the values of `left_i` and `right_i`?**
   - A: The values will be within the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

4. **Q: How should pairs with the same `left` or `right` values be handled?**
   - A: Since each pair [left_i, right_i] is unique and given that `left_i < right_i`, there will be no pair `[a, b] = [a, b]`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach or a greedy approach. Given the nature of the problem, a greedy algorithm is simpler and more efficient in practice.

1. **Greedy Strategy**:
   - Sort the pairs based on their `right` value.
   - Iterate through the sorted pairs and maintain a count of the longest chain found.
   - Include a pair in the chain only if the `right` end of the current pair is less than the `left` end of the next pair.

2. **Steps**:
   - Sort the input list by the second element of each pair.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the end of the current chain.
   - Iterate through the pairs and extend the chain if possible.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting the pairs will take `O(n log n)`.
   - Iterating through the pairs will take `O(n)`.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### Code

Here is the implementation following the explained strategy:

```javascript
function findLongestChain(pairs) {
    // Sort pairs by the second element of each pair
    pairs.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let currentEnd = -Infinity;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let pair of pairs) {
        if (pair[0] > currentEnd) {
            count++;
            currentEnd = pair[1];
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
let pairs = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]];
console.log(findLongestChain(pairs)); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
   - We sort the pairs such that the pair with a smaller `right` value comes first.

2. **Greedy Choice**:
   - Initialize `currentEnd` to `-Infinity` to signify the end of the last added pair to the chain.
   - Initialize `count` to zero to count the maximum length of the chain.
   - For each pair, if the `left` value of the current pair is greater than `currentEnd`, it means this pair can be appended to the current chain.
   - Update the `currentEnd` to the `right` value of the current pair.

This method ensures that we make the optimal choice at each step by trying to include the pair with the smallest possible `right` value to facilitate adding more pairs to the chain.
