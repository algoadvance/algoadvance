[Leetcode 327. Count of Range Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l327)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the count of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.

A range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i` <= `j`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - The number of elements in `nums` is at most 100,000.
   - The values of the elements in `nums` are between `-2^31` and `2^31-1`.
   - The values of `lower` and `upper` are also between `-2^31` and `2^31-1`.

2. **Is the array sorted or unsorted?**
   - The array `nums` is unsorted.

3. **Can the sum overflow?**
   - JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers, so the sum should not overflow within given constraints.

### Strategy
A naive solution would be to use two nested loops to calculate the range sums and count those within the specified range. However, this would have a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which is impractical for large input sizes.

A more efficient approach would involve using a modified merge sort algorithm to count the range sums. This divides the problem into smaller subproblems and combines results, ensuring a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.

### Code
Here's how we can implement the solution using a divide-and-conquer (merge sort) approach:

```javascript
var countRangeSum = function(nums, lower, upper) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let count = 0;

    // Helper function for merge sort
    function mergeSort(lo, hi) {
        if (lo === hi) return [0];
        if (lo > hi) return [];

        let mid = lo + Math.floor((hi - lo) / 2);
        const left = mergeSort(lo, mid);
        const right = mergeSort(mid + 1, hi);

        let prefixSums = [];

        // Merging the two halves with count
        for (let sum of right) {
            let start = lowerBound(left, sum - upper);
            let end = upperBound(left, sum - lower);
            count += (end - start);
        }

        // Merge the two sorted arrays
        let merged = [];
        let i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
            if (left[i] < right[j]) {
                merged.push(left[i++]);
            } else {
                merged.push(right[j++]);
            }
        }
        while (i < left.length) merged.push(left[i++]);
        while (j < right.length) merged.push(right[j++]);

        prefixSums = merged;
        return prefixSums;
    }

    // Helper functions to determine ranges in the array
    function lowerBound(arr, value) {
        let start = 0, end = arr.length;
        while (start < end) {
            let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
            if (arr[mid] < value) start = mid + 1;
            else end = mid;
        }
        return start;
    }

    function upperBound(arr, value) {
        let start = 0, end = arr.length;
        while (start < end) {
            let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
            if (arr[mid] <= value) start = mid + 1;
            else end = mid;
        }
        return start;
    }

    let prefixedSums = [0];
    for (let num of nums) {
        prefixedSums.push(prefixedSums[prefixedSums.length - 1] + num);
    }

    mergeSort(0, prefixedSums.length - 1);
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n log n)` due to the divide-and-conquer approach (merge sort). The space complexity is also `O(n)` as additional space is used to store the prefix sums and during the merge process. This approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently.
