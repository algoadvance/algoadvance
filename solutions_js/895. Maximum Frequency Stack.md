[Leetcode 895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l895)
## Problem Statement
Design a stack-like data structure that supports the following operations:
- `push(int x)`: Pushes an integer `x` onto the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack will be removed and returned.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:
- `FreqStack()`: Initializes the object.
- `void push(int x)`: Pushes an integer `x` onto the stack.
- `int pop()`: Removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.

You need to optimize the operations to ensure they run efficiently.

### Example 1
```
Input:
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 7 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5, and 7 have the same frequency. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input values be any integer, including negative values and zero?
2. Is there an upper limit on the number of elements that can be pushed onto the stack?
3. Should the implementation account for exceptionally high frequencies of elements?

## Code
Here is the implementation for the `FreqStack` class in JavaScript:

```javascript
class FreqStack {
    constructor() {
        this.freqMap = new Map(); // Frequency map to count occurrences of elements
        this.groupMap = new Map(); // Group map to stack elements by their frequency
        this.maxFreq = 0; // Track the maximum frequency of any element
    }

    push(x) {
        // Update the frequency of the element x
        if (!this.freqMap.has(x)) this.freqMap.set(x, 0);
        let freq = this.freqMap.get(x) + 1;
        this.freqMap.set(x, freq);
        
        // Update the maximum frequency
        if (freq > this.maxFreq) {
            this.maxFreq = freq;
        }
        
        // Add the element x to the stack corresponding to its frequency
        if (!this.groupMap.has(freq)) {
            this.groupMap.set(freq, []);
        }
        this.groupMap.get(freq).push(x);
    }

    pop() {
        // Get the most frequent elements' stack
        let stack = this.groupMap.get(this.maxFreq);
        let x = stack.pop();
        
        // Decrement the frequency of the element x
        this.freqMap.set(x, this.freqMap.get(x) - 1);
        
        // If the current stack is empty, reduce the maximum frequency
        if (stack.length === 0) {
            this.maxFreq -= 1;
        }
        
        return x;
    }
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a `freqMap` to store the frequency of each element.
   - Use a `groupMap` where each key is a frequency and the value is a stack of elements with that frequency.
   - Use a variable (`maxFreq`) to keep track of the current highest frequency.
   
2. **Push Operation:**
   - Update the frequency of the element in `freqMap`.
   - Update `maxFreq` if the new frequency of the element is higher than the current `maxFreq`.
   - Push the element onto the stack corresponding to its frequency in `groupMap`.

3. **Pop Operation:**
   - Pop from the stack corresponding to `maxFreq`.
   - Decrease the frequency of the popped element in `freqMap`.
   - If the stack corresponding to `maxFreq` becomes empty, decrease `maxFreq`.

## Time Complexity
- **Push Operation:** O(1), as adding an element to the frequency map and group map is constant time.
- **Pop Operation:** O(1), as removing an element from the top of a stack and updating the frequency map is constant time.
