[Leetcode 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1822)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1822: **Sign of the Product of an Array**

You are given an integer array `nums`. Let `product` be the product of all values in the array `nums`.

- Return **1** if `product > 0`.
- Return **-1** if `product < 0`.
- Return **0** if `product == 0`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is 144, and signFunc(144) = 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is 0, and signFunc(0) = 0
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]
Output: -1
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is -1, and signFunc(-1) = -1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero?**
   - Yes, as shown in the examples.
   
2. **Do we need to actually calculate the product?**
   - No, we only need to determine its sign.

3. **Do we need to handle any special edge cases?**
   - We should only handle cases as specified by the constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Zero Detection**: If any number in the array is zero, the product will be zero; thus, return 0.
2. **Negative Number Counting**: Count the number of negative numbers in the array.
   - If the count is even, the product is positive.
   - If the count is odd, the product is negative.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var arraySign = function(nums) {
    let negatives = 0; // count of negative numbers
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) return 0; // product is zero if any number is zero
        if (num < 0) negatives++; // count negative numbers
    }
    return negatives % 2 === 0 ? 1 : -1; // even negatives -> positive product, odd negatives -> negative product
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - We traverse the array once to count negatives and check for zeros.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no additional space used apart from a few variables.

This approach ensures that we determine the sign of the product efficiently without actual multiplication, which could lead to integer overflow.
