[Leetcode 1328. Break a Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1328)
### Problem Statement
You are given a palindromic string `palindrome` consisting of only lowercase English letters. You need to replace **exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the lexicographically smallest one possible.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to do so, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input string guaranteed to be a palindrome?
     - Yes, the problem states it is a palindromic string.
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
     - The length of the string may range from 1 to 1000.

2. **Character Constraints:**
   - Are all characters guaranteed to be lowercase English letters?
     - Yes, all characters are lowercase English letters.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string length is 1, the only possible palindrome consists of a single character, thus it is impossible to make it non-palindromic by altering just one character. We should return an empty string in this case.

### Strategy
1. **Palindromic Nature:**
   - Given the input is a palindrome, we need to make it non-palindromic by changing just one character.
   - To make the resulting string lexicographically smallest, we should try to change the leftmost character that is not 'a' to 'a'. This minimizes the string alteration and ensures the smallest lexicographical outcome.

2. **Two Key Scenarios:**
   - If all characters in the string are 'a', replace the last character with 'b' to make it lexicographically smallest.
   - If the string length is 1, return an empty string because no change can make a single character string non-palindromic.

### Code
Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function breakPalindrome(palindrome) {
    if (palindrome.length === 1) {
        return "";
    }
    
    const arr = palindrome.split('');
    
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(arr.length / 2); i++) {
        if (arr[i] !== 'a') {
            arr[i] = 'a';
            return arr.join('');
        }
    }
    
    // If all characters are 'a'
    arr[arr.length - 1] = 'b';
    return arr.join('');
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. We only traverse half the string in the worst case, so it's essentially linear.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) since we are splitting the string into an array to manipulate characters.

Feel free to test the solution with various test cases to ensure its correctness.
