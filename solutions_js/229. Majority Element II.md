[Leetcode 229. Majority Element II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l229)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find all elements in an array that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times. The algorithm should run in linear time and use only constant extra space.

You are given an integer array `nums` with a size of `n`. You need to find all the elements that appear more than `n/3` times in the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   - The input array can be of any length, including zero.

2. **Can the input array contain negative numbers or zero?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain any integers.

3. **Should the solution account for the case where no elements appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times?**
   - Yes, in this case, the solution should return an empty list.

4. **Is the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

## Strategy

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is a well-known method to solve the problem of finding majority elements in linear time and with constant space. We'll use a modified version of this algorithm to handle the n/3 majority condition. Here's the strategy step-by-step:

1. **Candidate Identification:** 
   - Use two candidates and their respective counts since there can be at most two elements each appearing more than n/3 times.
   - Traverse through the array and maintain these two candidates and their counts.

2. **Candidate Validation:**
   - After identifying potential candidates, traverse the array again to count the occurrences of these candidates to confirm if they appear more than n/3 times.

3. **Return the result:**
   - Collect those candidates that have actual counts more than n/3.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return [];
    
    let candidate1 = null, candidate2 = null, count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

    // First pass: find potential candidates
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (candidate1 !== null && candidate1 === num) {
            count1++;
        } else if (candidate2 !== null && candidate2 === num) {
            count2++;
        } else if (count1 === 0) {
            candidate1 = num;
            count1 = 1;
        } else if (count2 === 0) {
            candidate2 = num;
            count2 = 1;
        } else {
            count1--;
            count2--;
        }
    }

    // Second pass: confirm candidates
    count1 = 0;
    count2 = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === candidate1) count1++;
        else if (num === candidate2) count2++;
    }

    const result = [];
    if (count1 > Math.floor(n / 3)) result.push(candidate1);
    if (count2 > Math.floor(n / 3)) result.push(candidate2);

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We make two passes through the array, each taking linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
