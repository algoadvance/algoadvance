[Leetcode 413. Arithmetic Slices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l413)
### Problem Statement
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, the array `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` is arithmetic because the difference between each consecutive pair of elements is 2.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of `nums`.

**Example:**
``` 
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The three arithmetic subarrays are [1,2,3], [2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements in `nums` be negative or zero?**
   - Yes, the elements can be any integers.
2. **What is the range of lengths for the input array?**
   - The length of the array can range from 1 to 5000.
3. **Is there a time complexity constraint or a preferred solution efficiency?**
   - Considering the constraints, an efficient solution is preferable.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Check for arrays with fewer than 3 elements as they cannot have any arithmetic slice.
2. **Traverse the Array**:
   - Use a loop to check for arithmetic properties (i.e., consistent differences between consecutive elements).
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current length of the arithmetic slice.

3. **Count Slices**:
   - Whenever an arithmetic property breaks, check the number of arithmetic slices that can be formed from the current segment and reset the counter.

4. **Math Behind Counting**:
   - For each segment found of length `k` (where `k >= 3`), the number of arithmetic slices is `(k - 2) * (k - 1) / 2`.

### Code

```javascript
var numberOfArithmeticSlices = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    if (n < 3) return 0;
    
    let count = 0;
    let current = 0;  // To track the count of current arithmetic slices

    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] === nums[i - 1] - nums[i - 2]) {
            current += 1;
            count += current; // Add current slices to total count
        } else {
            current = 0; // Reset current counter
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfArithmeticSlices([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: 3
console.log(numberOfArithmeticSlices([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we use a few variables to store the counters and the current slice count.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently determine the number of arithmetic slices in a given integer array using a single pass, making it optimal for the given problem constraints.
