[Leetcode 1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1329)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` of integers, and you need to sort each of the diagonals in ascending order and return the sorted matrix.

A diagonal is defined as the set of elements that share the same difference between their row and column indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What values can the elements of the matrix take?**
   - The elements can be any integers.

2. **What is the range for `m` and `n`?**
   - The dimensions of the matrix, `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns), can range from 1 to 100.

3. **How are the diagonals identified?**
   - All elements `mat[i][j]` belonging to the same diagonal have the same value of `i - j`.

4. **Do we need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - Single-row or single-column matrices should be handled correctly, as their elements are technically on one or multiple diagonals.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Diagonals:**
   - Use `i - j` to identify elements that belong to the same diagonal.
   
2. **Sort Diagonals:**
   - Collect elements of each diagonal in a dictionary.
   - Sort the elements of each diagonal.
   
3. **Reassign Sorted Values:**
   - Place sorted values back into their original positions in the matrix.

### Code

```javascript
function diagonalSort(mat) {
    const m = mat.length;
    const n = mat[0].length;
    const diagonals = {};

    // Step 1: Collect elements of each diagonal
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const key = i - j;
            if (!diagonals[key]) diagonals[key] = [];
            diagonals[key].push(mat[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Sort each diagonal
    for (const key in diagonals) {
        diagonals[key].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    // Step 3: Place sorted values back into the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const key = i - j;
            mat[i][j] = diagonals[key].shift();
        }
    }

    return mat;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Collecting Elements:** O(m * n) - We traverse each element of the matrix once.
- **Sorting Diagonals:** O(min(m, n) * dlog(d)) for each diagonal, where `d` is the number of elements in the diagonal. Given the worst case, it's effectively O(m * n * log(min(m, n))).
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m * n * log(min(m, n))), considering both sorting and traversal.

This solution ensures diagonal sorting while maintaining a manageable runtime, even for larger matrices.
