[Leetcode 1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1190)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and parentheses. You need to reverse the strings within each pair of matching parentheses and return the resultant string. The result should not contain any parentheses.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "(abcd)"
Output: "dcba"

Input: s = "(u(love)i)"
Output: "iloveu"

Input: s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"
Output: "leetcode"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there always balanced parentheses in the input string?
   **A:** Yes, the problem guarantees that the parentheses are always balanced.

2. **Q:** Can we have nested parentheses?
   **A:** Yes, nested parentheses are allowed and should be handled accordingly.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the input string?
   **A:** The problem constraints typically specify a reasonable length, but for a coding interview, you can usually consider up to \(10^4\) characters.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a **stack** to keep track of indexes of opening parentheses `(`.
   - Use a **list** or a mutable string (array of characters) to build the resultant string.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize an empty stack that will store indices of opening parentheses.
   - Iterate through the input string character by character.
   - When encountering an opening parenthesis `(`, push its index onto the stack.
   - When encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, pop the last opening parenthesis index from the stack.
     - Reverse the substring between the popped index and the current index.
     - Replace the reversed substring within the array and continue.
   - After processing all characters, join the list into a resultant string and remove any residual parentheses.
     
3. **Steps:**
   - Traverse the string using an array representation.
   - Use the stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched opening parentheses.
   - Reversing the substring between pairs of parentheses whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The entire string is traversed once for the characters (O(n) complexity).
   - For each closing parenthesis, the reversing of substring is O(k), where k is the length between the matched parentheses. The total complexity hence remains O(n).

### Code
```javascript
function reverseParentheses(s) {
    // Convert the string to an array for mutable operations
    const arr = Array.from(s);
    const stack = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else if (arr[i] === ')') {
            const start = stack.pop();
            reverse(arr, start + 1, i - 1);
        }
    }

    // Build the final string by excluding parentheses
    return arr.filter(char => char !== '(' && char !== ')').join('');
}

function reverse(arr, start, end) {
    while (start < end) {
        [arr[start], arr[end]] = [arr[end], arr[start]];
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

// Test cases
console.log(reverseParentheses("(abcd)")); // Output: "dcba"
console.log(reverseParentheses("(u(love)i)")); // Output: "iloveu"
console.log(reverseParentheses("(ed(et(oc))el)")); // Output: "leetcode"
console.log(reverseParentheses("a(bc(def(gh))ij)k")); // Output: "aijkfedcgh"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), considering the space required to store the stack and the modified array of characters.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle nested parentheses and reverse the substrings correctly.
