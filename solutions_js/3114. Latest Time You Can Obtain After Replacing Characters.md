[Leetcode 3114. Latest Time You Can Obtain After Replacing Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3114)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the form of "HH:MM", where some of the digits in the string are represented by a question mark `'?'`. The valid range for the hour is `00` to `23`, and the valid range for the minutes is `00` to `59`. You want to replace the question marks with digits to obtain the latest possible time.

For example:
- Given `time = "2?:?0"`, the latest valid time is `"23:50"`.

Write a function `maximumTime` that takes a single input `time` and returns the latest valid time by replacing the question marks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the input string contain invalid formats or values?**
   A: No. The input will always be in the "HH:MM" format.

2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?**
   A: No. The length will always be 5 characters (including the colon).

3. **Q: Can the input string have no question marks at all?**
   A: Yes, but it will be already in a valid time format.

### Strategy

1. **Handling Hours:**
   - The first character can be '2' if the second character is '0', '1', '2', or '3'. If not, the first character can be '1' if the second character is another digit or a question mark.
   - The second character can be '3', '9', '8', etc. depending on the first character being '2' or otherwise.
   
2. **Handling Minutes:**
   - Both characters should be filled by '5' and '9' respectively if they are question marks.

We will replace each question mark starting from the largest possible number that fits in the allowed time range.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumTime(time) {
    let res = time.split('');
    
    // Handle the hours
    if (res[0] === '?') {
        res[0] = (res[1] !== '?' && res[1] > '3') ? '1' : '2';
    }
    if (res[1] === '?') {
        res[1] = (res[0] === '2') ? '3' : '9';
    }
    
    // Handle the minutes
    if (res[3] === '?') {
        res[3] = '5';
    }
    if (res[4] === '?') {
        res[4] = '9';
    }
    
    return res.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumTime("2?:?0")); // Output: "23:50"
console.log(maximumTime("0?:3?")); // Output: "09:39"
console.log(maximumTime("1?:22")); // Output: "19:22"
console.log(maximumTime("?4:??")); // Output: "14:59"
console.log(maximumTime("??:??")); // Output: "23:59"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**, as we are only performing a constant number of operations on a fixed-length input string. This ensures our code runs efficiently under the given constraints.
