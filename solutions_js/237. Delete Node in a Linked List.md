[Leetcode 237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l237)
### Problem Statement

The problem is from LeetCode, and itâ€™s as follows:

**237. Delete Node in a Linked List**

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the node to be deleted directly (node = 5), which means you don't have direct access to the head of the list.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do we have access to the head of the linked list?**
   - No, we only have access to the node that needs to be deleted.

2. **Can the node to be deleted be the tail node?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not the tail node.

3. **Should we return the head of the linked list or modify it in place?**
   - The problem implies that the operation should be performed in place.

### Strategy

Since we only have access to the node that needs to be deleted, we can't traverse back to the previous node to change its `next` pointer. Instead, we can simulate the deletion by copying the data from the next node to the current node and then bypassing the next node.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} node
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
 */
var deleteNode = function(node) {
    // Copy the value from the next node to the current node
    node.val = node.next.val;
    // Link to the node after the next node
    node.next = node.next.next;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(1)**. Here's why:
- We only perform a fixed number of operations (copying values and adjusting pointers), regardless of the length of the linked list.

By employing this approach, we effectively "delete" the given node by making it a copy of the next node, then bypassing the next node.
