[Leetcode 2427. Number of Common Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2427)
### Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return the number of common factors of `a` and `b`. An integer `x` is a common factor of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a` and `b`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the expected range for the integers `a` and `b`?
   - Assume `a` and `b` can be as large as 10^9.
2. **Output Type**: Should the output be an integer?
   - Yes, the output should be an integer representing the count of common factors.
3. **Edge Cases**: What if `a` equals `b`?
   - The solution should handle this smoothly since every factor of `a` will also be a factor of `b` and vice versa.

### Strategy
To find the common factors of two numbers `a` and `b`, the following approach can be used:

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Calculate the GCD of `a` and `b`. The common factors of `a` and `b` are the divisors of their GCD.
2. **Find Divisors**: Count the divisors of the GCD. This can be done efficiently up to the square root of the GCD to reduce the number of iterations.

Given that the numbers can be very large, computing the GCD efficiently and iterating up to the square root of the GCD helps keep the solution within feasible time limits.

### Code
```javascript
function numberOfCommonFactors(a, b) {
    // Helper function to compute the GCD of two numbers
    function gcd(x, y) {
        while (y !== 0) {
            let temp = y;
            y = x % y;
            x = temp;
        }
        return x;
    }

    // Calculate GCD of a and b
    const gcdValue = gcd(a, b);
    
    // Calculate number of divisors of gcdValue
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i * i <= gcdValue; i++) {
        if (gcdValue % i === 0) {
            count++; // i is a divisor
            if (i !== gcdValue / i) {
                count++; // gcdValue / i is a different divisor
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(numberOfCommonFactors(12, 18)); // Output: 4 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
console.log(numberOfCommonFactors(100, 80)); // Output: 5 (factors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10)
```

### Time Complexity
1. **GCD Calculation**: The Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD has a time complexity of `O(log(min(a, b)))`.
2. **Finding Divisors**: Iterating up to the square root of the GCD has a time complexity of `O(√gcd(a, b))`.

Overall, the combined time complexity is `O(log(min(a, b)) + √gcd(a, b))`, which is efficient given the constraints.
