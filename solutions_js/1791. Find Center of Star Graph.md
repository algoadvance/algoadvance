[Leetcode 1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1791)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected star graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly `n-1` edges that connect the center node with every other node. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `u` and `v`. Return the center of the given star graph.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Size of `edges` array**: The size of the `edges` array will always be `n-1` because it's a star graph and we have `n-1` edges.
2. **Validity of input**: Can I assume that the input will always be a valid star graph? Yes, you can assume that.

## Strategy

In a star graph, the center node will appear in every edge. Thus, the node that appears in the first two edges must be the center. This is because all the other `n-2` nodes each connect directly to the center, and only the center node will be a common node in multiple edges.

### Steps:
1. Extract the first edge `edges[0]`.
2. Extract the second edge `edges[1]`.
3. Compare the nodes in these two edges to find the common node.

## Code

```javascript
var findCenter = function(edges) {
    // Extract nodes from the first edge
    const [a, b] = edges[0];
    // Extract nodes from the second edge
    const [c, d] = edges[1];
    
    // Check which node is common in both edges
    if (a === c || a === d) {
        return a;
    }
    return b;
};

// Example usage:
const edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 2]];
console.log(findCenter(edges)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

The solution runs in constant time:
- Extracting nodes from the first two edges (`O(1)`).
- Comparing the nodes to find the common node (`O(1)`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(1)`.
