[Leetcode 1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1610)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of points `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `angle` representing the viewing angle from the horizontal axis, determine the maximum number of points you can see from a single location at the origin `[0, 0]` within this field of view. You can always see points that have the same coordinates as the origin.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the coordinates provided in any specific range?**
   - Usually, coordinates can be large, but for the purposes of determining the visible points, the magnitudes won't matter as much as their angular positions.
   
2. **Can points have negative coordinates?**
   - Yes, points can have both positive and negative coordinates as they are on a 2D plane.

3. **What should we return if there are no points?**
   - Return `0` since no points are visible.

4. **Is the field of view 360 degrees or limited within the given angle?**
   - The field of view is limited within the given angle.

## Strategy

1. **Convert Points to Angles:**
   - For each point, convert its Cartesian coordinates to an angle with respect to the x-axis using `atan2(y, x)`.
   
2. **Handle Full Circle:**
   - To manage the circular nature of angles, concatenate the list of angles with itself, essentially doubling the list. This helps handle wrap-around cases.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Sort the angles, and use a sliding window approach to count the maximum number of points that fit within a window of size `angle`.

4. **Consider Points at Origin:**
   - Count how many points are at the origin initially, as these points are always visible.
   
5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure extreme small or large angle cases are managed properly.

## Code

```javascript
function maxVisiblePoints(points, angle, location) {
    const [x0, y0] = location;
    let angles = [];
    let extra = 0;

    for (const [x, y] of points) {
        if (x === x0 && y === y0) {
            extra += 1;
        } else {
            angles.push(Math.atan2(y - y0, x - x0) * (180 / Math.PI));
        }
    }

    angles.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // To manage the circular nature of angles, double up the sorted angles
    const n = angles.length;
    angles = angles.concat(angles.map(a => a + 360));

    let maxCount = 0;
    let start = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < angles.length; end++) {
        while (angles[end] - angles[start] > angle) {
            start++;
        }
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxCount + extra;
}

// Example usage:
const points = [[2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [1, 1]];
const angle = 90;
const location = [1, 1];
console.log(maxVisiblePoints(points, angle, location)); // Output should be 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the sorting step and the sliding window mechanism.

- **Sorting the angles:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Sliding window traversal:** \(O(2n)\) or \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
