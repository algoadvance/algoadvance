[Leetcode 542. 01 Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l542)
## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return the distance of the nearest `0` for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Dimensions:** What are the possible values of `m` and `n` (the dimensions of the matrix)?
    - They typically range from 1 to 10^4.
    
2. **Matrix Content:** Are there any constraints or special properties of the matrix?
    - The matrix contains only 0s and 1s.
  
3. **Distance Calculation:** How is the "distance" defined?
    - The distance is the minimum number of steps required to move from one cell to another, where each move can be to a directly adjacent cell in one of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

## Strategy

We can use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to solve this problem efficiently. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize Distance Matrix:**
   - Create a distance matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix, initializing all distances to `Infinity` (or a large number), except cells that are `0`, which are initialized to `0`.

2. **Queue for BFS:**
   - Initialize a queue to manage the BFS process. Enqueue all `0` cells, since they are the starting points of our BFS.

3. **BFS Process:**
   - Process cells in the queue. For each cell, update its neighbors' distances if a shorter path is found. Enqueue the neighbors with updated distances.

4. **Directional Vectors:**
   - Utilize directional vectors to simplify neighbor traversal.

## Code

```javascript
const updateMatrix = (mat) => {
    const rows = mat.length;
    const cols = mat[0].length;
    const dist = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(Infinity));
    const queue = [];
    
    // Initialize distances and queue
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (mat[r][c] === 0) {
                dist[r][c] = 0;
                queue.push([r, c]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Directions array (up, down, left, right)
    const directions = [
        [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]
    ];
    
    // BFS
    while (queue.length) {
        const [r, c] = queue.shift();
        
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr;
            const nc = c + dc;
            
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols) {
                if (dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1) {
                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1;
                    queue.push([nr, nc]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dist;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns:
- Initial population of the queue and distance matrix takes `O(m * n)`.
- Each cell is processed and its neighbors are checked in constant time, leading to a total of `O(m * n)` operations.
