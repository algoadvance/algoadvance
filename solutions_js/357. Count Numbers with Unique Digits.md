[Leetcode 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l357)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10^n.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` should be a non-negative integer, typically within a practical limit due to system constraints.

2. **What is considered a valid unique digit number?**
   - A number is considered to have unique digits if no digit repeats within that number.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to consider various cases:
1. **Base Cases:**
   - When `n = 0`, there's only one number (0), which is trivially unique.
   - When `n = 1`, we have 10 numbers (0 through 9), all of which are unique.

2. **General Case:**
   - For `n > 1`, we need to consider numbers with more digits, ensuring no digit repeats.
   - We can calculate numbers with unique digits by iterating through possible digits and combining them in a way that avoids repetition.

### Approach:
1. **Mathematical Combination:**
   - Calculate numbers with exactly k digits (1 ≤ k ≤ n) that are unique.
   - For `k = 1`: We have 10 options (0 through 9).
   - For `k = 2`: The first digit has 9 options (1 through 9) and the second has 9 options (0 through 9 excluding the first digit), thus 9 * 9.
   - For `k = 3`: It becomes 9 * 9 * 8, and so on.
   - Continue this pattern until reaching `k = n`.

2. **Summation:**
   - Sum up all the valid unique digit numbers for each digit length from 1 through n.

### Code

```javascript
function countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    
    let result = 10; // for n = 1
    let uniqueDigits = 9;
    let availableDigits = 9;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        uniqueDigits = uniqueDigits * availableDigits;
        result += uniqueDigits;
        availableDigits--;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If `n = 0`, return 1 because only the number 0 is there.

2. **Initialization:**
   - For `n = 1`, the range from 0 to 9 is already counted, so `result = 10`.

3. **Loop:**
   - Start from 2 because 1-digit numbers have already been considered.
   - For each additional digit length, calculate the count of numbers composed of unique digits by multiplying `uniqueDigits` with `availableDigits`.
   - Decrease `availableDigits` by 1 after each iteration because the pool of available digits shrinks as we use more digits.
   - Add the count to `result`.

4. **Return:**
   - Finally, `result` holds the sum of all numbers with unique digits for up to `n` digits.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n). There is a single loop running from 2 to n.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We are using a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently counts the numbers with unique digits by leveraging combinatorial calculations for each digit length incrementally.
