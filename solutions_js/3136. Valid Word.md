[Leetcode 3136. Valid Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3136)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `words` consisting of lowercase alphabetical characters only. The word is deemed valid if and only if:

1. The frequency of each character in `word` is the same.

Given the `words`, you need to determine if they are valid or not.

Output `true` if the given string `word` is valid, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few things:
1. Can the input string be empty?
   - We'll assume the input string won't be empty unless specified otherwise because an empty string would trivially meet the requirement.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - We'll assume typical constraints for such problems, where the length of the string could be reasonably large but not exceeding limits that would make basic frequency counting infeasible.

### Strategy

1. **Count Character Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter (e.g., a hash map) to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. **Check Frequency Consistency**: Ensure all frequencies are equal.

### Code

Here's the complete solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isValidWord(word) {
    const frequency = {};

    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    for (let char of word) {
        if (frequency[char]) {
            frequency[char]++;
        } else {
            frequency[char] = 1;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Extract frequencies and ensure they are the same
    const frequencies = Object.values(frequency);
    const uniqueFrequencies = new Set(frequencies);

    return uniqueFrequencies.size === 1;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(isValidWord("aabbcc"));  // true, since each character appears twice.
console.log(isValidWord("aaaa"));    // true, since all characters appear 4 times.
console.log(isValidWord("abc"));     // true, since each character appears once.
console.log(isValidWord("aabbcd"));  // false, as 'a' and 'b' appear twice but 'c' and 'd' appear only once.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: O(n) where n is the length of the string, as we need to iterate through each character once.
- **Checking Frequency Consistency**: The size of the frequency object can be at most 26 (since there are only 26 lowercase letters). Extracting values and forming a set from them is O(1) in terms of the size of the character set.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

The approach is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.
