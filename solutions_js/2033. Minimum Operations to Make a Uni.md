[Leetcode 2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2033)
## Problem Statement

**2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid**

You are given a 2D grid of integers `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can add `x` or subtract `x` from any number in the grid.

A Uni-Value Grid is a grid where all the numbers are the same. Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid a Uni-Value Grid. If it is not possible, return -1.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: grid = [[2,4],[6,8]], x = 2
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= x, grid[i][j] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values within the grid guaranteed to be integers?**
   - Yes, by problem definition.

2. **Is there a case where it's impossible to make all the grid values the same by only adding or subtracting `x`?**
   - Yes, if the difference between any two values in the grid is not divisible by `x`, it is impossible.

3. **Should the result be the total number of operations across all cells in the grid?**
   - Yes, we must find the minimum number of operations needed.

## Strategy

1. **Flatten the Grid**: Convert the 2D grid into a 1D array for easier processing.
2. **Sort for Median Calculation**: Sorting allows efficient calculation and usage of median in minimizing operations.
3. **Check Divisibility**: Ensure that the difference between any two values in the grid is divisible by `x`. If not, return `-1`.
4. **Use the Median**: The median minimizes the total number of operations needed to equalize the numbers as any other target (mean or arbitrary point) will result in more moves.
5. **Calculate Operations**: Compute the total number of operations required to convert all elements to the median.

## Code

```javascript
var minOperations = function(grid, x) {
    // Flatten the grid
    let flatGrid = [];
    for (let row of grid) {
        flatGrid.push(...row);
    }
    
    // Check if it's possible to make the grid uni-value
    let base = flatGrid[0];
    for (let num of flatGrid) {
        if (Math.abs(num - base) % x !== 0) {
            return -1;
        }
    }

    // Sort the flattened grid
    flatGrid.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Calculate the median
    let n = flatGrid.length;
    let median = flatGrid[Math.floor(n / 2)];

    // Calculate the number of operations
    let operations = 0;
    for (let num of flatGrid) {
        operations += Math.abs(num - median) / x;
    }

    return operations;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Flattening the Grid**: O(m * n)
2. **Checking Divisibility**: O(m * n)
3. **Sorting**: O((m * n) log(m * n))
4. **Calculating Operations**: O(m * n)

Overall, the primary factor is sorting, so the time complexity is **O((m * n) log(m * n))**.
