[Leetcode 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1523)
### Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Will `low` always be less than or equal to `high`?
   - **A**: Yes, `low` will always be less than or equal to `high`.
   
2. **Q**: Can `low` and `high` be the same?
   - **A**: Yes, they can be the same.

3. **Q**: What are the largest input values for `low` and `high`?
   - **A**: The constraints are not specified here, but let's assume they can be very large integers within the typical range allowed in JavaScript (i.e., up to 2^53 - 1).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of odd integers in the inclusive interval `[low, high]`. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Brute Force Approach** (not recommended for large ranges):
   - Iterate from `low` to `high`.
   - Check for each number if it is odd and count it.
   
2. **Optimized Mathematical Approach**:
   - We can calculate the number of odd numbers between `1` and `high`.
   - Then calculate the number of odd numbers between `1` and `low - 1`.
   - Subtract the two to get the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

Mathematically, the number of odd numbers ≤ `n` can be derived as `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript solution implementing the mathematical approach:

```javascript
function countOdds(low, high) {
    // Helper function to count number of odds up to and including n
    const countOddsUpTo = (n) => {
        return Math.floor((n + 1) / 2);
    }

    return countOddsUpTo(high) - countOddsUpTo(low - 1);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution executes a constant number of operations regardless of the size of `low` and `high`.

### Explanation

1. **Count odd numbers up to high (`Math.floor((high + 1) / 2)`)**:
   - This counts how many odd numbers are there from 1 to `high`.

2. **Count odd numbers up to `low - 1` (`Math.floor(low / 2)`)**:
   - This counts how many odd numbers are there from 1 to `low - 1`.

3. Subtract the second count from the first to get the number of odd numbers in the range `[low, high]`.

This approach works efficiently even for very large values of `low` and `high`.
