[Leetcode 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1248)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is called "nice" if there are exactly `k` odd numbers on it. Return the number of nice subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= k <= nums.length`

2. **What does the term "subarray" refer to?**
   - A subarray is a contiguous segment of an array.

3. **What should be the output if no such nice subarrays exist?**
   - The output should be `0`.

4. **Can there be negative numbers in the input array?**
   - According to the problem statement, elements of the array are strictly positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique with Prefix Sum:**
   - This problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window approach along with prefix sums to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
   - We will use a hash map to store the counts of prefix sums (number of odd numbers up to a given index).

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize a hash map to store the counts of prefix sums.
   - Keep track of the current count of odd numbers.
   - Traverse through the array and for each element:
     - Increase the odd count if the current element is odd.
     - Check if the `oddCount` minus `k` exists in the hash map.
     - If it exists, add the value (the count at that key in the hash map) to the result because it means there is a subarray ending at the current index that has exactly `k` odd numbers.
     - Update the hash map with the current `oddCount`.

3. **Edge cases:**
   - When the array length is less than `k`, the output should be `0`.
   - When the number of odd numbers in the array is less than `k`, the output should be `0`.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfSubarrays(nums, k) {
    let oddCount = 0;
    let prefixSumCount = new Map();
    let result = 0;
    
    // Initial prefix sum count
    prefixSumCount.set(0, 1);
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        // Check if the number is odd
        if (num % 2 !== 0) {
            oddCount++;
        }
        
        // Check if there is a prefix sum that makes the current subarray nice
        if (prefixSumCount.has(oddCount - k)) {
            result += prefixSumCount.get(oddCount - k);
        }
        
        // Update prefix sum count for the current oddCount
        prefixSumCount.set(oddCount, (prefixSumCount.get(oddCount) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the `nums` array once, and each operation within the loop (including map operations) is O(1) on average.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst case, we might store counts of every prefix sum in the map, which requires O(n) extra space.
