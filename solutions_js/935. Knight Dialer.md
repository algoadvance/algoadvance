[Leetcode 935. Knight Dialer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l935)
### Problem Statement
The problem "935. Knight Dialer" from LeetCode requires us to determine how many distinct numbers we can dial on a phone keypad with the knight moving around starting from any digit. The knight has a specific movement pattern similar to the movement of a knight in chess. The challenge is to compute the number of distinct sequences of length `n` that can be formed following the knight's move rules starting from any digit.

Given the keypad:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
  0
```

The Knight's possible moves from a digit `d` are:

- From 1: [6, 8]
- From 2: [7, 9]
- From 3: [4, 8]
- From 4: [3, 9, 0]
- From 5: []
- From 6: [1, 7, 0]
- From 7: [2, 6]
- From 8: [1, 3]
- From 9: [2, 4]
- From 0: [4, 6]

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any restrictions on the maximum value of `n`?
2. Should we consider sequences that start from any digit from 0-9?
3. Is there any specific time complexity requirement for the solution?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start by defining the possible moves for each digit based on the knight's move rules.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of counts of sequences ending at each digit for sequences of length `k`.
3. **DP Table**: Maintain a table (`dp[k][d]`) where `dp[k][d]` represents the number of distinct sequences of length `k` ending at digit `d`.
   - For `k = 1`, each digit on its own represents a sequence of length 1, so initialize `dp[1][d] = 1` for all `d`.
4. **Transition**: For each sequence of length `k`, update the counts for sequences of length `k + 1` using the possible moves.
5. **Summation**: Sum up the values from the dp array for the final result.

### Code

```javascript
var knightDialer = function(N) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const moves = {
        0: [4, 6],
        1: [6, 8],
        2: [7, 9],
        3: [4, 8],
        4: [3, 9, 0],
        5: [],
        6: [1, 7, 0],
        7: [2, 6],
        8: [1, 3],
        9: [2, 4]
    };

    // dp[k][d] will be the number of sequences of length k ending with digit d
    let dp = new Array(2).fill().map(() => new Array(10).fill(0));

    // Initial condition: For length 1 we can start from any digit
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        dp[1][i] = 1;
    }

    // Fill DP table for lengths from 2 to N
    for (let k = 2; k <= N; k++) {
        let newDp = new Array(10).fill(0);
        for (let d = 0; d < 10; d++) {
            for (let move of moves[d]) {
                newDp[d] = (newDp[d] + dp[(k - 1) % 2][move]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        dp[k % 2] = newDp;
    }

    // Sum up results for all last digits
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        result = (result + dp[N % 2][i]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) because each digit's possible moves are constant (at most 3 moves), and we iterate from 1 to N.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we only use a fixed size array for keeping track of counts for two consecutive lengths.

This approach ensures that we optimize both the time and space requirements while calculating the number of distinct sequences the knight can dial, given the constraints.
