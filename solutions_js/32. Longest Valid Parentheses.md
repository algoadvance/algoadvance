[Leetcode 32. Longest Valid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l32)
### Problem Statement
The problem is to find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring in a given string containing just the characters '(' and ')'. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What is the maximum length of the input string?
2. **Character validation**: Can I assume that the input string contains only '(' and ')' characters?
3. **Edge cases**: How should I handle edge cases such as an empty string or strings with no valid parentheses?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, I will consider two main approaches:

1. **Using a Stack**: This approach involves using a stack to track the indices of characters. A stack will help us keep track of the last unmatched '(' index. We can then pop from the stack when we find a matching ')', and calculate the length of the valid substring.

2. **Using Two Counters**: This approach involves traversing the string twice. One traversal from the left to right and another from the right to the left. This approach uses two counters to count the number of '(' and ')' characters. The idea is to ensure that at any point, the number of ')' does not exceed the number of '(' while counting from left to right and vice versa.

### Code

#### Stack Approach
```javascript
function longestValidParentheses(s) {
    let maxLength = 0;
    let stack = [-1];  // Initialize stack with -1 to handle the base case
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else {
            stack.pop();
            if (stack.length === 0) {
                stack.push(i);
            } else {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - stack[stack.length - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

#### Two Counters Approach
```javascript
function longestValidParentheses(s) {
    let left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;
    // Traverse the string from the left to the right
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            left++;
        } else {
            right++;
        }
        if (left === right) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 2 * right);
        } else if (right > left) {
            left = right = 0;
        }
    }

    left = right = 0;
    
    // Traverse the string from the right to the left
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            left++;
        } else {
            right++;
        }
        if (left === right) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 2 * left);
        } else if (left > right) {
            left = right = 0;
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Stack Approach**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character in the string is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Two Counters Approach**: O(n), as it involves two passes over the string and each pass is O(n).

Both approaches are efficient and handle the problem within an optimal time complexity.
