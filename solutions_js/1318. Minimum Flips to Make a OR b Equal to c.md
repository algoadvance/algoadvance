[Leetcode 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1318)
### Problem Statement

Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make `( a OR b == c )`.

A flip operation changes a bit `1` to `0` or a bit `0` to `1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`? 
   - Typically, these values can be large (up to 2^31 - 1).
2. **Output:** What should be returned if the values already satisfy `a OR b == c`?
   - Return `0` as no flips are required.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can perform the following steps:

1. Convert each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` starting from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
2. For each bit position `i`:
   - Check the ith bit of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - If `c_i` is `0`, both `a_i` and `b_i` need to be `0`. If either of them is `1`, a flip is needed.
   - If `c_i` is `1`, at least one of `a_i` or `b_i` must be `1`. If both are `0`, a flip is needed.
3. Sum up the total number of flips required.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @param {number} c
 * @return {number}
 */
function minFlips(a, b, c) {
    let flips = 0;
    // Process bit by bit
    while (a > 0 || b > 0 || c > 0) {
        // Get the least significant bit (LSB) of a, b, and c
        let bitA = a & 1;
        let bitB = b & 1;
        let bitC = c & 1;
        
        // If the c bit is 0, both a and b bits need to be 0
        if (bitC === 0) {
            if (bitA === 1) flips++;
            if (bitB === 1) flips++;
        } else {
            // If the c bit is 1, at least one of a or b bits need to be 1
            if (bitA === 0 && bitB === 0) flips++;
        }
        
        // Right shift a, b, and c to handle the next bit
        a >>= 1;
        b >>= 1;
        c >>= 1;
    }
    
    return flips;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minFlips(2, 6, 5)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of bits in the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Given the nature of the problem, this will be at most O(32) for standard 32-bit integers, which simplifies to O(1) in practical terms.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the space used does not scale with the input size.

### Explanation

- By examining each bit position from least significant to most significant, we calculate the number of necessary flips directly.
- Shifting `a`, `b`, and `c` to the right in each iteration effectively moves us through each bit position.
- The bitwise operations are efficient, handling the checks and shifts in constant time for each bit.
