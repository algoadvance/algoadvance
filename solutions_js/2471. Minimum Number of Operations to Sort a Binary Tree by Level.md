[Leetcode 2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2471)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node in this tree has a distinct value from `1` to `n`.

In one operation, you can perform the following steps on the binary tree:

1. Select any two nodes at the same level and swap their values.

You need to return the minimum number of operations needed to make the tree sorted level by level, from left to right.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Characteristics**: Are the nodes guaranteed to have unique values ranging from `1` to `n`? 
   
   Yes, each node value is distinct and ranges from `1` to `n`.

2. **Depth of Tree**: How deep can the tree be?

   The depth can vary but the constraints will typically allow the solution to run in reasonable time for depth typical to binary trees.

3. **Regular or Perfect Binary Tree**: Is the tree complete or perfect, or can it also include irregular shapes?

   The tree can have any shape; it does not need to be complete or perfect.

## Strategy

1. **Level-Order Traversal**: Perform a level-order traversal to get the nodes for each level.
2. **Sorting Each Level**: For each level, sort the nodes in ascending order.
3. **Minimum Swaps Calculation**: Calculate the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array. This can be achieved by finding the cycle decomposition of the permutation of node values.

### Approach:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Store Levels**: Store the values of nodes at each level.
3. **Sort and Track Indexes**: For each level, sort the node values and use the sorted indexes to count the minimum swaps required.
4. **Swaps Calculation**: Use a helper function to calculate minimum swaps needed to sort the array representation of each level.

## Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes.
2. **Sorting each level**: O(m log m), where `m` is the number of nodes at that level. Summing over all levels typically gives the complexity close to O(n log n) in the worst case.
3. **Swap Calculation**: O(m) for each level, leading to O(n) overall.

Combining these, the overall time complexity should ideally be O(n log n).

## Code

```javascript
function minimumOperations(root) {
    // Function to perform level-order traversal and collect nodes at each level
    function levelOrderTraversal(root) {
        const levels = [];
        if (!root) return levels;
        
        const queue = [root];
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const levelSize = queue.length;
            const currentLevel = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                const node = queue.shift();
                currentLevel.push(node.val);
                if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
                if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
            }
            levels.push(currentLevel);
        }
        return levels;
    }

    // Function to find minimum swaps needed to sort the array
    function minSwapsToSort(arr) {
        const n = arr.length;
        const arrPos = arr.map((val, idx) => [val, idx]);
        arrPos.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

        const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
        let swaps = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i] || arrPos[i][1] === i) continue;
            let cycleSize = 0;
            let j = i;
            while (!visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                j = arrPos[j][1];
                cycleSize++;
            }
            if (cycleSize > 1) swaps += (cycleSize - 1);
        }

        return swaps;
    }

    const levels = levelOrderTraversal(root);
    let totalSwaps = 0;

    for (const level of levels) {
        totalSwaps += minSwapsToSort(level);
    }

    return totalSwaps;
}
```

This implementation performs the necessary level-order traversal, collects the nodes at each level, and then sorts each level using the minimum swaps required to bring the array into order.
