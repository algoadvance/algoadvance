[Leetcode 866. Prime Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l866)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `n`.

- A palindrome integer is an integer x for which `reverse(x) = x`. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
- An integer `x` is prime if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers `a` and `b` (i.e., `a * b = x`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the integer `n`? 
   - The constraints are typically provided, but I'll assume `1 <= n <= 10^8` based on typical problem constraints.
2. Should we consider `1` as a prime number?
   - By the usual definition, 1 is not considered a prime number.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Check if a number is a palindrome**: A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. **Check if a number is a prime**: A number is prime if it's greater than 1 and not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
3. **Generate palindromic numbers**: We can generate palindromic numbers starting from `n` and check if they are prime.

The steps in the strategy are:

1. Start from `n` and increment until you find the smallest number that is both a palindrome and prime.
2. For each candidate number, check if it is a palindrome.
3. If it is a palindrome, check if it is a prime number.
4. If both conditions are satisfied, return the number.

## Code

```javascript
function smallestPrimePalindrome(n) {
    function isPalindrome(x) {
        const s = x.toString();
        return s === s.split('').reverse().join('');
    }

    function isPrime(x) {
        if (x <= 1) return false;
        if (x === 2) return true;
        if (x % 2 === 0) return false;
        for (let i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(x); i += 2) {
            if (x % i === 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Handling known corner edge cases regarding the upper constraint
    if (8 <= n && n <= 11) return 11;
    
    let num = n;
    while (true) {
        if (isPalindrome(num) && isPrime(num)) {
            return num;
        }
        num++;
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(smallestPrimePalindrome(13));  // Output: 101
```

## Time Complexity

- **Palindrome Check (isPalindrome)**: This takes O(d) time where `d` is the number of digits in the number.
- **Prime Check (isPrime)**: This takes O(âˆšn) time in the worst case since we check divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Given that we incrementally check each number starting from `n`, the overall complexity will be dominated by the combined complexity of checking each number. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity can be quite large, especially since finding a palindrome that's also a prime may involve checking many numbers.

However, for practical limits (up to 10^8) and considering nature of prime palindromes, we need efficient checks to avoid excessive calculations. The provided solution efficiently handles the constraints but may need optimizations for extremely large `n` values within constraints.
