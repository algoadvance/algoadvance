[Leetcode 1486. XOR Operation in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1486)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and an integer `start`.

Define an array `nums` where `nums[i] = start + 2*i` (where `i` is a non-negative integer).

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of `nums`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: 
nums = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
Result = 0 XOR 2 XOR 4 XOR 6 XOR 8 = 8
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4, start = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 
nums = [3, 5, 7, 9]
Result = 3 XOR 5 XOR 7 XOR 9 = 8
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on n and start?**
   - Typically `n` will be between 1 and 10^4, and `start` will be a non-negative integer, up to 1000.

2. **Is there any constraint on the execution time?**
   - Solutions are expected to execute efficiently even for the upper limits of the constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Result**: Start with a variable `result` initialized to 0. This will hold the XOR of all elements.
2. **Loop Over n**: Use a loop to iterate over the range of `n` and calculate each element `nums[i] = start + 2*i`.
3. **XOR Operation**: Within the loop, keep updating the `result` with `result ^= nums[i]`.
4. **Return Result**: After completing the loop, return the `result`.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function xorOperation(n, start) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result ^= start + 2 * i;
    }
    return result;
}

// Testing the function
console.log(xorOperation(5, 0)); // Output: 8
console.log(xorOperation(4, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(xorOperation(1, 7)); // Output: 7
console.log(xorOperation(10, 5)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we iterate over the range `n` once and perform a constant-time operation within each iteration.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a fixed amount of extra space (for the `result` variable). The array `nums` is not explicitly created and stored in memory.
