[Leetcode 1250. Check If It Is a Good Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1250)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. You need to determine if you can obtain an array consisting of only ones by any sequence of the following operations:

1. Choose two different indices `i` and `j`, and set either `nums[i] = nums[i] % nums[j]` or `nums[j] = nums[j] % nums[i]` (repetitions allowed).

Output `true` if you can obtain an array of only ones. Otherwise, output `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - The array size is in the range [1, 10^5].
2. **What is the value range of the integers within `nums`?**
   - The values are positive integers and fit within standard integer ranges.
3. **Can the initial array `nums` contain the number 1?**
   - Yes, it can. If the array contains a 1, the array is already "good".
   
### Strategy
To decide whether we can transform the array `nums` into an array of all ones using the allowed operation, we need to apply some mathematical observation: 

- The key insight is based on the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).
- If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the array is 1, it means there exists a combination of operations that can reduce all numbers to 1.

Thus, the solution boils down to finding the GCD of the entire array and checking if it's 1.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript code to solve this problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

var isGoodArray = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    
    // Calculate the GCD for the entire array
    let currentGCD = nums[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, nums[i]);
        
        // Early exit if GCD becomes 1
        if (currentGCD === 1) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return currentGCD === 1;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity of the `gcd` function is `O(log(min(a, b)))`. Since we are iterating through the entire array to compute the GCD for all elements, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(m))`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the maximum value in `nums`.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently determines whether the given array can be turned into an array of ones using the allowed operations.
