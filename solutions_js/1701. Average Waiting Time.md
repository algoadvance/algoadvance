[Leetcode 1701. Average Waiting Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1701)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `customers`, where `customers[i] = [arrival_i, time_i]`:

- `arrival_i` is the arrival time of the i-th customer.
- `time_i` is the time needed to prepare the food for the i-th customer.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Waiting time is defined as the time a customer waits in the restaurant until they get their food. More formally, if the i-th customer arrives at `arrival_i` and the food for this customer takes `time_i` minutes to prepare, then they will have to wait `finish` for the food and the operation will complete at `finish = max(current_time, arrival_i) + time_i`, where `current_time` is the time at which the previous customer’s food preparation is completed. The average waiting time is computed as:
```
average_waiting_time = (sum of waiting times for all customers) / number of customers
```
and should be returned as a floating-point number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do customers have to wait if they arrive earlier even if the restaurant is idle?
2. Can two customers arrive at the same time?

## Strategy

1. Initialize `current_time` to 0, which tracks the time at which the last customer’s food is ready.
2. Initialize `total_waiting_time` to 0, which will accumulate the total waiting time for all customers.
3. Iterate through each customer in the `customers` array:
    - For the i-th customer, calculate their finish time as `finish = max(current_time, arrival_i) + time_i`.
    - The waiting time for this customer is `finish - arrival_i`.
    - Update the `total_waiting_time` by adding the waiting time for this customer.
    - Set `current_time` to this customer’s `finish` time.
4. After processing all customers, calculate the average waiting time as `total_waiting_time / num_customers`.
5. Return the average waiting time.

## Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of customers because we process each customer once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we are using a few extra variables that do not depend on the size of the input.

## Code

```javascript
function averageWaitingTime(customers) {
    let currentTime = 0;
    let totalWaitingTime = 0;

    for (let [arrival, time] of customers) {
        currentTime = Math.max(currentTime, arrival) + time;
        totalWaitingTime += currentTime - arrival;
    }

    return totalWaitingTime / customers.length;
}

// Example usage:
const customers = [[1, 2], [2, 5], [4, 3]];
console.log(averageWaitingTime(customers));  // Output: 5.0
```

This implementation iterates through each customer, calculates their respective waiting times, and then computes the average waiting time across all customers.
