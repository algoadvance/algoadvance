[Leetcode 1410. HTML Entity Parser](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1410)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1410: HTML Entity Parser

"HTML entity parser" is a program that replaces special characters with their corresponding HTML entities. Given a string `text`, you must implement a function that, for each HTML entity representation in the string (`&quot;`, `&apos;`, `&amp;`, `&gt;`, `&lt;`, and `&frasl;`), replaces it with its corresponding character (`"`, `'`, `&`, `>`, `<`, and `/`). 

You need to implement this functionality and return the transformed string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the HTML entities always valid and correctly formed in the input string?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume the HTML entities in the input string are correctly formed and valid.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - **A:** The length of the input string is not explicitly mentioned, but you can assume it fits within typical problem constraints in LeetCode (e.g., up to 10^4 characters).

3. **Q:** Should I handle other HTML entities that are not mentioned (like `&copy;`)?
   - **A:** No, you only need to handle the specific entities mentioned in the problem statement.

### Strategy

1. Use a mapping of HTML entity strings to their corresponding characters.
2. Traverse the input string and replace any found HTML entities with their corresponding characters using the map.
3. Use the substring method to identify and replace entities.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code that implements this strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} text
 * @return {string}
 */
var entityParser = function(text) {
    const entityMap = {
        '&quot;': '"',
        '&apos;': "'",
        '&amp;': '&',
        '&gt;': '>',
        '&lt;': '<',
        '&frasl;': '/'
    };

    let result = "";
    let i = 0;
    
    while (i < text.length) {
        if (text[i] === '&') {
            // Check if there is a matching entity in the subsequent characters
            let found = false;
            for (let [entity, char] of Object.entries(entityMap)) {
                if (text.startsWith(entity, i)) {
                    result += char;
                    i += entity.length;
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                // If no matching entity, just append the '&'
                result += text[i];
                i++;
            }
        } else {
            result += text[i];
            i++;
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case (O(n)):** The for loop only runs for n characters as string startsWith operations are O(K) where K is the average length of the matching key which is a constant factor since we are dealing with small fixed-length entities.
- **Worst Case (O(n*K)):** Where K is the length of the longest HTML entity (in this case, 7 for `&frasl;`). If each character is part of a valid entity prefix, this slows down marginally but in practice remains linear.

In conclusion, the function operates in linear time relative to the length of the input string, i.e., **O(n)**.
