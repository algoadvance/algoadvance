[Leetcode 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1222)
## Problem Statement

On a chessboard, each square is represented by a coordinate pair (x, y), where 1 <= x, y <= 8. You have a list of queens' positions and the position of a single king. You need to determine which queens can attack the king, using the standard rules of chess where queens can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
```

**Note:**
- The input list may include at most one queen on any given square.
- The list of queens is not sorted.
- The position of the king will be given and does not overlap with any queen's position.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the positions given in two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (8x8 chessboard) or in some other format?
   - **Answer**: The positions are given in two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (8x8 chessboard).
2. Can we expect valid input ranges (all coordinates between 0 and 7 inclusive)?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the input ranges will be valid.
3. Do we need to consider any special edge cases, like queens blocking each other?
   - **Answer**: Yes, queens can block each other based on their respective positions relative to the king.

## Strategy
We'll explore all potential attack directions from the king's position:
1. Horizontal and vertical directions: left, right, up, down.
2. Diagonal directions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.

We'll iterate in each direction from the king's position and check if we encounter any queen. If a queen is encountered, it's added to the result list, and we stop searching further in that direction because any further queen in the same direction would be blocked.

## Code
```javascript
function queensAttacktheKing(queens, king) {
    const directions = [
        [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0], // horizontal and vertical
        [1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1] // diagonal
    ];
    
    const result = [];
    const queenSet = new Set(queens.map(q => q.toString()));
    
    for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
        let x = king[0];
        let y = king[1];
        
        while (true) {
            x += dx;
            y += dy;
            
            if (x < 0 || x >= 8 || y < 0 || y >= 8) {
                break;
            }
            
            if (queenSet.has([x, y].toString())) {
                result.push([x, y]);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
const queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]];
const king = [0,0];
console.log(queensAttacktheKing(queens, king)); // Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
```

## Time Complexity
- Building the set of queens takes O(q), where q is the number of queens.
- Each direction is checked until the edge of the board is reached or a queen is encountered. In the worst case, this is O(8) per direction, with 8 directions total.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(q + 64) which simplifies to O(q).
