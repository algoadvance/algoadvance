[Leetcode 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1760)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` where the `i-th` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:
- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls in each bag.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag. 

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum number of balls in a bag after performing the operations.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3

Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that all input arrays are non-empty for the given constraints?
   - Yes.
2. Should the solution handle the largest possible inputs within reasonable time and space limits?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search:** The objective is to minimize the maximum number of balls in any bag using the allowed operations. We can use binary search on the possible maximum number of balls in a bag to find the minimum possible value.

2. **Feasibility Check:** For a given maximum value `x`, check if it's possible to ensure all bags have at most `x` balls using at most `maxOperations`. For each bag, if it contains `y` balls, we need `(y - 1) // x` operations to split it so that each part has at most `x` balls.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Define the search range; the minimum possible value is `1` and the maximum possible value is `max(nums)`.
   - Use the feasibility check in each iteration of the binary search to adjust the search range.
   
## Code Implementation

```javascript
function minimumSize(nums, maxOperations) {
    let left = 1;
    let right = Math.max(...nums);

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        // Determine if it's feasible to ensure max bag size is at most 'mid'
        let operations = 0;
        for (let num of nums) {
            operations += Math.floor((num - 1) / mid);
        }
        
        if (operations <= maxOperations) {
            right = mid; // try for a smaller maximum size
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // need a larger size
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}

// Example usage
console.log(minimumSize([9], 2)); // Output: 3
console.log(minimumSize([2, 4, 8, 2], 4)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Iterations:** The binary search will run in \(O(\log(\text{max}(nums)))\) iterations.
- **Feasibility Check:** For each midpoint, the feasibility check takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.

- **Overall Complexity:** \(O(n \log(\text{max}(nums)))\). Given the constraints, this is efficient and manageable.
