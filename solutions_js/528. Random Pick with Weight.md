## Problem Statement
---

**528. Random Pick with Weight**

You are given an array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the weight of `i`-th index (0-indexed). We need to implement a solution that will randomly pick an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`, inclusive, and it should return the index with probability proportional to its weight. 

For example, if `w = [1,3]`, the solution should return index `0` with a probability of `1/4` (since `1/(1+3)`) and index `1` with a probability of `3/4` (since `3/(1+3)`).

You need to implement a class `Solution`:

- `Solution(int[] w)` Initializes the object with the integer array `w`.
- `int pickIndex()` Returns a random index, chosen with probability proportional to the weight at that index.

## Clarifying Questions
---
1. Are the weights always positive integers?
   - Yes.
2. Can the input array `w` be empty?
   - No, the input array will contain at least one element.

## Strategy
---
1. **Preprocessing and Accumulation**:
   - First, we create a prefix sum array such that each element at index `i` in this prefix sum array is the sum of all weights from the start up to index `i`.
   - This helps in mapping the weights to ranges. The value of the prefix sum array at the last index will be equal to the total sum of the weights, which represents the entire range.

2. **Random Selection**:
   - We generate a random number in the range `[0, total sum of weights)`.
   - Using binary search, we find which range (index in the prefix sum array) this random number falls into.

Here is the implementation of this strategy:

## Code
---

```javascript
class Solution {
  constructor(w) {
    this.prefixSums = this.buildPrefixSums(w);
    this.totalSum = this.prefixSums[this.prefixSums.length - 1];
  }

  buildPrefixSums(w) {
    const prefixSums = new Array(w.length);
    prefixSums[0] = w[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < w.length; i++) {
      prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i - 1] + w[i];
    }
    return prefixSums;
  }

  pickIndex() {
    const target = Math.random() * this.totalSum;
    let low = 0;
    let high = this.prefixSums.length - 1;
    
    while (low < high) {
      const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
      if (this.prefixSums[mid] > target) {
        high = mid;
      } else {
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    return low;
  }
}
```

## Time Complexity
---
- **Constructor (`Solution` function)**:
  - Building the prefix sums array takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `w`.

- **Pick Index (`pickIndex` function)**:
  - Picking an index involves generating a random number in `O(1)` time and using binary search to find the corresponding index, which takes `O(log n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexities are:
- **Constructor**: `O(n)`
- **pickIndex**: `O(log n)`
