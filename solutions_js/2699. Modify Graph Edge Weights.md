[Leetcode 2699. Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2699)
## Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, represented as an edge list containing `m` edges with initially unknown weights. Each edge is represented as a triplet `(u, v, w)` where `u` and `v` are the nodes the edge connects, and `w` is the weight which is initially unknown and needs to be determined.

Additionally, you're given two nodes `src` and `dest` representing the source and destination nodes, respectively, and an integer `target` that denotes the desired shortest distance from `src` to `dest` after the edge weights have been assigned.

Your task is to determine the edge weights such that the shortest path from `src` to `dest` equals the given `target`. Return a modified edge list with assigned weights. If it's not possible to achieve the shortest path of exactly `target`, return an empty list.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the possible values of the weights?
   - The weights are positive integers.
   
2. Do we need to take care of cases where the graph is not connected?
   - Yes, if there is no path from `src` to `dest`, we return an empty list.

3. Can there be multiple solutions, and do we need to find all of them?
   - Only one valid solution is required. If there are multiple, returning any one valid solution is acceptable.

4. Is modifying the weights mandatory for all edges, or only when necessary to achieve the target?
   - You modify weights as necessary to ensure the shortest path from `src` to `dest` is equal to `target`.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Initial Check with BFS/Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Calculate the shortest path from `src` to `dest` with initially default weight settings (e.g., weight set to 1 for unknowns).
3. **Binary Search for Adjustment:** Use techniques like binary search or other heuristic methods to adjust the edge weights in such a way that the shortest path from `src` to `dest` equals the `target`.
4. **Validation Check:** Ensure that the modified weights work as expected by re-running the shortest path algorithm to confirm the desired path length.
5. **Edge Weights Update:** Finally, update the edge list with the computed weights and return it.

## Code

Here's a rough implementation considering our strategy:

```javascript
function modifyGraphEdgeWeights(n, edges, src, dest, target) {
  const adjList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  edges.forEach(([u, v, w], idx) => {
    adjList[u].push([v, w, idx]);
    adjList[v].push([u, w, idx]);
  });

  function dijkstra(source) {
    const distances = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    const priorityQueue = [[0, source]]; 
    distances[source] = 0;

    while (priorityQueue.length > 0) {
      priorityQueue.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
      const [currentDist, u] = priorityQueue.pop();

      if (currentDist > distances[u]) continue;

      for (const [v, weight, idx] of adjList[u]) {
        const newDist = currentDist + (weight === -1 ? 1 : weight); // default unknowns to 1
        if (newDist < distances[v]) {
          distances[v] = newDist;
          priorityQueue.push([newDist, v]);
        }
      }
    }
    return distances[dest];
  }

  let minCost = dijkstra(src);
  if (minCost > target) return []; // impossible to achieve

  edges.forEach(edge => {
    if (edge[2] === -1) edge[2] = 1; // set unknown weights to default minimum
  });

  const unknownEdges = edges.filter(edge => edge[2] === 1);
  let extraNeeded = target - minCost;

  for (const edge of unknownEdges) {
    if (extraNeeded <= 0) break;
    const extraProvided = Math.min(extraNeeded, target); // adjust to provide necessary extra weight
    edge[2] += extraProvided;
    extraNeeded -= extraProvided;
  }

  if (dijkstra(src) !== target) return []; // final check
  return edges.map(edge => [edge[0], edge[1], edge[2]]);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Representation:** \(O(m)\)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** \(O((m + n) \log n)\)
- **Weight Adjustment:** Roughly \(O(k \log k)\) where \(k\) is the number of unknown edges.

Thus, the approximate overall time complexity is \(O(m \log n)\) considering common scenarios often dominated by shortest path calculations.

This solution accomplishes the task by attempting to set the weights effectively and validating the result using shortest path techniques. Adjustments may be required for particular edge cases and large inputs.
