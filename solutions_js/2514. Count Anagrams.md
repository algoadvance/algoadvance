[Leetcode 2514. Count Anagrams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2514)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to count the number of distinct anagrams for each substring of `s` and return the total count. 

An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint on the string `s`?**
   - There are no specific constraints given, but you may assume it can be large enough to consider efficient algorithms for the solution.

2. **What should be the output if `s` is empty?**
   - If `s` is empty, the total count of anagrams is `0`.

3. **Is the input string limited to lowercase English letters only?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, we will assume that the input string contains only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Understand Anagrams:**
   - An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a string.
   - Two substrings are anagrams if their character counts are the same.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - We need to generate all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
   - For each substring, track its character count.
   - Use a data structure to store these character counts to verify anagrams quickly.

3. **Efficient Checking:**
   - Rather than checking and storing each substring, we can use a hashing technique with sorted tuples or frequency maps to keep track of character counts.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Use a nested loop to generate all possible substrings.
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each "character count map" which represents anagrams.
   - Sum counts from the dictionary to get the total number of anagrammatic pairs.

### Code

Here is the potential JavaScript solution for the given problem:

```javascript
function countAnagrams(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let totalCount = 0;
    
    // Dictionary to store character maps
    let anagramCounts = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Initialize character count for the current starting point
        let charCount = Array(26).fill(0);
        
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            // Increment the count for the current character
            charCount[s.charCodeAt(j) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
            
            // Create a string representation of the character count array
            let charCountStr = charCount.join('#');
            
            // Update the anagram dictionary
            if (anagramCounts.has(charCountStr)) {
                anagramCounts.set(charCountStr, anagramCounts.get(charCountStr) + 1);
            } else {
                anagramCounts.set(charCountStr, 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Total anagrams count is the sum of all counts from the map
    totalCount = Array.from(anagramCounts.values()).reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
    
    return totalCount;
}

// Example usage:
let s = "abcba";
console.log(countAnagrams(s)); // Example output
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating Substrings:** The nested loop generates `O(n^2)` substrings.
- **Character Counting:** For each substring, character counting requires `O(26)` time (constant time), which simplifies to `O(1)` for fixed character sets (i.e., English alphabet).
- **Overall Complexity:** The solution has an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which is efficient for practical values of `n`.

### Summary

- The problem of counting distinct anagrams can be efficiently solved by leveraging character counts using hashing.
- This approach ensures that instead of explicitly generating each anagram, we use character frequency vectors to validate and count them.
- The provided algorithm efficiently computes the total count of anagrammatic substrings in `O(n^2)` time.
