[Leetcode 2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2610)
## Problem Statement:

Given a one-dimensional array of integers, convert it into a 2D array with the following conditions:
1. Each element of the 2D array must not be empty.
2. Each subarray should contain only unique elements.
3. The order of elements in the input array must be preserved in the 2D output array.
4. Minimize the number of subarrays.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Characteristics**:
    - Can the input array contain negative numbers?
    - Can the input array contain zero or be empty?
  
2. **Output Structure**:
    - Can the subarrays be of different lengths?

3. **Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of the input array?
    
Assuming general constraints:
- The input array can have any integer.
- The input array can be empty.
- There are no strict bounds on the length of the input array, but typical cases involve `n` up to 10^5.

## Strategy:

To minimize the number of subarrays and maintain sequence order, we can process the array element by element, adding each element to the current subarray if it is unique within that subarray. If it is a duplicate, start a new subarray.

Steps:
1. Initialize an array `result` to hold subarrays.
2. Initialize an empty subarray `currentSubarray` and an empty Set `seen` to track unique elements in the current subarray.
3. Iterate through each element in the input array.
   - If the element is not in `seen`, add it to `currentSubarray` and `seen`.
   - If the element is already in `seen`, push `currentSubarray` to `result`, reset `currentSubarray` to start a new subarray, and reset `seen`.
   - Add the element to the new `currentSubarray` and `seen`.
4. Add the last `currentSubarray` to `result` after the loop.

## Code:

```javascript
function convertTo2DArray(arr) {
    let result = [];
    let currentSubarray = [];
    let seen = new Set();

    for (let num of arr) {
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            result.push(currentSubarray);
            currentSubarray = [];
            seen.clear();
        }
        currentSubarray.push(num);
        seen.add(num);
    }

    if (currentSubarray.length > 0) {
        result.push(currentSubarray);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the input array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the storage requirement for the `result` array and the `seen` Set.

This approach ensures that the conditions are met while keeping the extra space allocation minimal and in linear time.
