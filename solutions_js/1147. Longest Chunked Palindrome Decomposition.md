[Leetcode 1147. Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1147)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `text`, you should split it into as many parts as possible so that every part is a non-empty substring and each part is a palindrome. The goal is to determine the maximum number of chunks such that the sum of the lengths of these chunks equals the length of the string and that each chunk is a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string contain special characters or spaces?**
   - For simplicity, assume the string only contains lowercase English letters.
   
2. **What is the range of string length?**
   - The length of the string can vary from 1 to 1000.

3. **How should overlapping chunks be handled?**
   - Chunks should not overlap. Each part must be a distinct substring of the input string.

4. **Are single-character chunks considered palindromes?**
   - Yes, single-character strings are trivially palindromes.

### Strategy

The problem requires finding a method to decompose the given string `text` into the maximum number of palindromic chunks. This problem can be approached using a greedy strategy:

1. We progressively check from the leftmost and rightmost parts of the string to find matching palindromic chunks.
2. When a matching chunk is found from both ends, we can consider it a valid palindromic part and move inward.
3. Repeat this process until no more matching pairs can be found.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function longestDecomposition(text) {
    const n = text.length;

    function helper(l, r) {
        // When there is no character left
        if (l > r) return 0;
        
        // When there is only one character
        if (l === r) return 1;
        
        for (let i = 1; i <= (r - l + 1) / 2; i++) {
            // Check if there's a matching chunk from the left and right
            if (text.slice(l, l + i) === text.slice(r - i + 1, r + 1)) {
                // Recursively check the inner string
                return 2 + helper(l + i, r - i);
            }
        }

        // If no chunk matches, it means we have to consider the whole string as 1 chunk
        return 1;
    }

    return helper(0, n - 1);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestDecomposition("ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi")); // Output: 7
console.log(longestDecomposition("merchant")); // Output: 1
console.log(longestDecomposition("antaprezatepzapreanta")); // Output: 11
console.log(longestDecomposition("aaa")); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed as follows:
- The `helper` function might check each pair of characters only once, resulting in a complexity roughly proportional to the length of the string.
- Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n^2)` in the worst case due to the slicing operations inside the loop for each recursive call.
  
In practice, most checks terminate early, making the algorithm more efficient than the worst-case bound might suggest.

By following this greedy strategy, we maximize the number of palindromic chunks efficiently.
