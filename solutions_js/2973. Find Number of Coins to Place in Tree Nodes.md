[Leetcode 2973. Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2973)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary tree with `n` nodes, each node is either empty (-1) or contains a certain number of coins (positive integer). Your task is to make each node in the tree have exactly one coin by performing the following operations: 
1. You can remove one coin from a node that has more than one coin and place it in an empty node.
2. You can also perform the reverse operation: take one coin from an empty node (which will become empty again) and place it in a node with fewer than one coin.

Write a function `findMoves(root)` that will return the minimum number of moves required to make each node have exactly one coin.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the structure of the tree node?**
   The tree nodes are represented using a class `TreeNode` where each node has an integer value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
2. **Can a node have 0 coins?**
   Yes, nodes can either be empty (-1 meaning zero coins) or have a positive integer representing the number of coins.
3. **Do empty nodes (nodes with -1) at the beginning become eligible for a coin after receiving one from another node?**
   Yes, an empty node can receive a coin and hence require another move to distribute the coin to another empty node.

### Strategy
The goal is to ensure each node has exactly one coin with the minimum number of moves. This means balancing out the surplus and deficit of coins.

**Steps:**
1. Perform a post-order traversal of the binary tree to calculate the surplus or deficit of coins from the leaf nodes to the root.
2. For each node, determine the number of moves required for balancing it and propagate this surplus/deficit to its parent node.
3. Sum up all the moves required during the traversal.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once during the post-order traversal.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function findMoves(root) {
  let moves = 0;

  function dfs(node) {
    if (node === null) return 0;
    
    const leftBalance = dfs(node.left);
    const rightBalance = dfs(node.right);
    
    // Calculate the current balance of coins at this node:
    // node.val (-1 means 0 coins, so we normalize it to 0)
    const totalBalance = (node.val === -1 ? 0 : node.val) + leftBalance + rightBalance - 1;
    
    // The moves are the absolute total balance required to move coins to/from this node.
    moves += Math.abs(totalBalance);
    
    // Return the balance of coins to the parent node, that is how much coins need to be moved.
    return totalBalance;
  }

  dfs(root);
  return moves;
}

// Example Usage:
// Construct a tree:
//       1
//      / \
//     0   0
// let root = new TreeNode(1);
// root.left = new TreeNode(0);
// root.right = new TreeNode(0);
// console.log(findMoves(root)); // Output: 1

//       1
//      / \
//     3   0
// let root = new TreeNode(1);
// root.left = new TreeNode(3);
// root.right = new TreeNode(0);
// console.log(findMoves(root)); // Output: 3
```

This code implements a `findMoves` function, using a helper function `dfs` to perform a depth-first traversal, balancing the nodes, and counting the number of moves required to achieve the balance where each node has exactly one coin.
