[Leetcode 1492. The kth Factor of n](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1492)
## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, return the `k`-th factor of `n`. A factor of `n` is defined as an integer `i` where `n % i == 0`. If `n` has less than `k` factors, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `n` and `k`?**
    - The constraints typically imply `1 <= n, k <= 1000` unless otherwise specified.
2. **What should be returned if `n` has fewer than `k` factors?**
    - Return `-1`.
3. **Are `n` and `k` always positive integers?**
    - Yes, the problem states they are positive integers.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We start with an empty list to store factors.
2. **Factor Identification**: Loop through numbers from `1` to `n`. If a number divides `n` without leaving a remainder, it is a factor.
3. **Count Factors**: Keep track of factors as we find them.
4. **Check Length**: After finding factors, check if we have at least `k` factors.
5. **Return Result**: Return the `k`-th factor if it exists, otherwise return `-1`.

## Code

Here's a step-by-step implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
function kthFactor(n, k) {
    let factors = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            factors.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    if (factors.length < k) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    return factors[k - 1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
    - In the worst case, the loop runs from `1` to `n`, which makes the time complexity linear in terms of `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(d)\)
    - Where `d` is the number of factors of `n`. In the worst case, this could be `n` if all numbers from `1` to `n` are factors, which is very rare.

The code efficiently calculates the kth factor of `n` where the primary work is done in a single loop over `[1, n]`.
