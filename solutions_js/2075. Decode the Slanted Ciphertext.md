[Leetcode 2075. Decode the Slanted Ciphertext](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2075)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a `slanted ciphertext` written in a rectangular matrix of size `n x m` (i.e., `n` rows and `m` columns) with the following properties:

1. Each row contains exactly `m` characters.
2. Each row is a contiguous substring of the original string and consecutive rows are added one after the other.
3. The encoded string can contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, or special characters.

To decode the slanted ciphertext, you need to read the matrix diagonally from the top-left.

For example, if you have the encoded matrix:

```
W 1  3
A O  L
D M  N
2 E  X
5 %  B
```

The order of characters you read is: `W, A, 1, D, O, M, 3, 2, L, 5, E, N, %, X, B`.

Write a function `decodeCiphertext` that takes the slanted encrypted ciphertext as input, with the number of `n` and `m`, and returns the decoded message as the decrypted string in a straight line (i.e., no spaces between characters).

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Format:**
    - Is the input given as a 2D array or a single string with dimensions `n` and `m`?
    
    *Assumption: The input is given as a 2D array of characters.*

2. **Output Format:**
    - Should the decoded string maintain all characters exactly as they appear?
    
    *Yes, the decoded message should include all characters exactly as they appear in the read order without any additional characters like spaces.*

3. **Handling Special Characters:**
    - How should the function handle special characters?
    
    *All characters including special characters should be part of the decoded message.*

## Strategy:

1. Initialize an empty result array to store characters as they are read diagonally.
2. Iterate over the array diagonally, starting from each column of the first row.
3. For each diagonal starting from `(0, col)`, iterate as long as you are within the bounds of the matrix.
4. Append each character encountered to the result array.
5. Convert the result array to a string and return it.

## Code:

```javascript
function decodeCiphertext(matrix, n, m) {
    if (!n || !m) return "";
    let result = [];
    
    // Iterate over each column of the first row
    for (let col = 0; col < m; col++) {
        let i = 0, j = col;
        // Traverse diagonally
        while (i < n && j < m) {
            result.push(matrix[i][j]);
            i++;
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    // Convert array to string and return
    return result.join('');
}

// Example usage:
const exampleMatrix = [
    ['W', '1', '3'],
    ['A', 'O', 'L'],
    ['D', 'M', 'N'],
    ['2', 'E', 'X'],
    ['5', '%', 'B']
];
console.log(decodeCiphertext(exampleMatrix, 5, 3)); // WA1DOM32L5EN%XB
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution is `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. This results from the necessity to visit each element of the matrix once while reading diagonally.

This should efficiently handle the decoding of the slanted ciphertext.
