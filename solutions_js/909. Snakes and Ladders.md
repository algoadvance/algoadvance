[Leetcode 909. Snakes and Ladders](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l909)
## Problem Statement
The problem is sourced from LeetCode (Problem number 909, "Snakes and Ladders").

You are given an `n x n` board, where cell numbers are labeled from 1 to `n^2` in a reverse Boustrophedon (zigzag) order. Snakes and ladders are also present on this board, represented by a list of lists.

Each cell contains either:
- A positive integer: indicating the destination of a ladder or a snake that starts from that cell.
- Or `-1`: indicating normal cell with no ladder or snake.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of moves required to reach from cell `1` to cell `n^2`. If it's not possible to reach the final cell, return `-1`.

**Example:**

Given the board below:
```
[
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
 [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
 [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]
]
```
The answer is `4` (1 -> 2 -> 15 -> 35 -> 36).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Board Boundaries:** Can the board be non-square or does it have to be `n x n`?
   - The board will always be `n x n`.
2. **Board Size Limits:** What is the maximum size for `n`?
   - We can assume `2 <= n <= 20`.
3. **Cell Values:** Can cells contain any value other than `-1` and a valid destination number?
   - No, cells will only have `-1` or a destination cell number.
4. **Movement Limits:** Can we assume standard dice roll limits (1 to 6)?
   - Yes, dice rolls will always be between 1 and 6.

## Code

```javascript
function snakesAndLadders(board) {
    const n = board.length;
    const getBoardValue = (num) => {
        let r = Math.floor((num - 1) / n);
        let c = (num - 1) % n;
        if (r % 2 === 1) c = n - 1 - c;
        r = n - 1 - r;
        return board[r][c];
    };

    let visited = new Array(n * n + 1).fill(false);
    let queue = [[1, 0]];
    visited[1] = true;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [curr, moves] = queue.shift();
        if (curr === n * n) return moves;

        for (let i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            let next = curr + i;
            if (next > n * n) break;
            let boardValue = getBoardValue(next);
            if (boardValue !== -1) next = boardValue;
            if (!visited[next]) {
                visited[next] = true;
                queue.push([next, moves + 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Convert Board Coordinates:**
   - Convert a 1D cell number to 2D board coordinates taking care of "zigzag" pattern.
2. **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**
   - Use BFS to explore the shortest path from cell `1` to cell `n^2`.
   - Track moves made using a queue where each entry is `[cellNumber, moves]`.
   - For each cell, attempt to move from 1 to 6 cells forward.
   - If the destination cell is a snake/ladder, move directly to the target cell.
   - If the final cell is reached, return the count of moves.
   - If the queue becomes empty without reaching the final cell, return `-1`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^2)**:
- The while-loop runs at most `n^2` times where `n` is the size of the board.
- Each iteration processes at most 6 moves, leading to a constant factor.

The space complexity is also **O(n^2)** due to:
- The queue and visited array storing up to `n^2` elements.
