[Leetcode 1923. Longest Common Subpath](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1923)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and an array composed of `n` lists of integers, all of different sizes. Your task is to find the length of the longest common subpath that exists in every one of the given lists.

For example:
```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2,3,4], [4,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5]]
Output: 2
```
The longest common subpath is `[2, 3]` or `[3, 4]`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into coding, here are a few questions that could help:
1. What is the maximum length of each path provided in the input?
2. Are there any constraints on the integers within the paths?
3. Should the subpath be contiguous in nature?
4. What should be done if there are multiple subpaths of the same maximum length?

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search on Length of Subpath:** Since we want the longest common subpath, we can use binary search on the length of the subpath to find the maximum possible length.
  
2. **Rolling Hash:** To efficiently check if a subpath of a certain length exists in all paths, employ the Rolling Hash technique.
  
3. **Intersection:** For each possible subpath length, compute all hashes in each path and find their intersection. If the intersection is not empty, then this length is possible.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how to implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the length of the longest common subpath in all given paths.
 * @param {number} n - The number of paths.
 * @param {number[][]} paths - The array of paths.
 * @return {number} - The length of the longest common subpath.
 */
const longestCommonSubpath = (n, paths) => {
    const MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7;
    const base = 257;

    const getHashes = (path, length) => {
        const n = path.length;
        if (n < length) return new Set();
        
        let hash = 0;
        let baseL = 1;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
          hash = (hash * base + path[i]) % MOD;
          baseL = (baseL * base) % MOD;
        }

        const hashes = new Set();
        hashes.add(hash);
        for (let i = length; i < n; ++i) {
          hash = (hash * base - path[i - length] * baseL % MOD + MOD) % MOD;
          hash = (hash + path[i]) % MOD;
          hashes.add(hash);
        }

        return hashes;
    };
    
    const valid = (length) => {
        let common = getHashes(paths[0], length);
        for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            const curHashes = getHashes(paths[i], length);
            const newCommon = new Set();
            for (const hash of common) {
                if (curHashes.has(hash)) {
                    newCommon.add(hash);
                }
            }
            if (newCommon.size === 0) return false;
            common = newCommon;
        }
        return common.size > 0;
    };

    let lo = 0, hi = Math.min(...paths.map(path => path.length));
    while (lo < hi) {
        const mid = Math.ceil((lo + hi) / 2);
        if (valid(mid)) {
            lo = mid;
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return lo;
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search on Length:** We perform a binary search from length 0 to the length of the smallest path \( O(\log \text{minLength}) \).

2. **Rolling Hash Computation:** For each length `L`, computing the rolling hash for a path takes \( O(n) \), and there are `n` paths, so it is \( O(n * m) \) where `m` is the average length of the paths.

3. **Intersection:** Intersecting sets takes \( O(p) \), where `p` is the number of hashes, which can be approximated to `m`.

Combining these, the final complexity is \( O(m * n * \log m) \), where `m` is the length of the smallest path and `n` is the number of paths.
