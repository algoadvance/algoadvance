[Leetcode 1343. Number of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1343)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of sub-arrays of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values for `arr`, `k`, and `threshold`?
    - Can `k` be larger than the length of `arr`?
    - Is there any constraint on the length of `arr`?

2. **Output**:
    - Should we return the count of sub-arrays meeting the condition, or do we also need to return the sub-arrays themselves?

Assuming the following based on typical problem constraints:
- The length of `arr` is between 1 and 10^5
- The values in `arr` are between -10^4 and 10^4
- `k` is a positive integer that does not exceed the length of the array

### Code

```javascript
function numOfSubarrays(arr, k, threshold) {
    const targetSum = k * threshold;
    let currentSum = 0;
    let count = 0;
  
    // Calculate the initial window's sum of the first k elements
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
    }
  
    // Check if the initial sum meets the threshold
    if (currentSum >= targetSum) {
        count++;
    }
  
    // Sliding window technique
    for (let i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        currentSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]; // slide the window right by adding new element and removing the old one
        if (currentSum >= targetSum) {
            count++;
        }
    }
  
    return count;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
    - Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements of the array.
    - This will be the sum for our initial sub-array.

2. **Threshold Comparison**:
    - Define the target sum as `k * threshold`.
    - Check if the initial sum meets or exceeds this target. If it does, increment the count.

3. **Sliding Window**:
    - Iterate through the array starting from the `k`th element.
    - For each new element, update the sum by adding the new element and subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window (i.e., `arr[i - k]`).
    - After updating the sum, check if it meets or exceeds the target. If it does, increment the count.

4. **Return**:
    - Finally, return the count of sub-arrays that meet the criteria.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Calculating the sum of the first `k` elements takes O(k).
- **Sliding Window**: Each window slide operation involves a constant time update of the sum (add one element and subtract one element), resulting in O(n-k) where `n` is the length of the array.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
