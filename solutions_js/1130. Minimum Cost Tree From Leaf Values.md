[Leetcode 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1130)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- Leaf nodes are the elements of the array;
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, we have to find the minimum possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node in these trees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the size of the array?**
   - `2 <= arr.length <= 40`
   
2. **Range of values in the array?**
   - `1 <= arr[i] <= 15`

3. **Can array elements be repeated?**
   - Yes, array elements can be repeated.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to split the array `arr` into two parts recursively and find the minimum cost required to compute the non-leaf nodes for each split. We'll use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum cost to compute the tree from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a `dp` array of size n x n (`n` being the length of the input array `arr`), where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum cost to compute the non-leaf nodes for the subtree formed by `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.
   - Create another helper 2D array `maxLeaf` to store the maximum leaf value in the subarray `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.

2. **Filling maxLeaf array:**
   - Iterate over all possible subarrays `[i, j]` and fill `maxLeaf[i][j]` with the maximum value in the subarray `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming to Fill dp array:**
   - Iterate over all possible subarrays lengths.
   - For each subarray `[i, j]`, calculate the minimum cost by trying every possible split point `k` (`i <= k < j`).
   - The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the minimum of `dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + maxLeaf[i][k] * maxLeaf[k+1][j]`.

4. **Result:**
   - The value `dp[0][n-1]` will give the minimum cost to compute the non-leaf nodes for the entire array.

### Code

```javascript
function mctFromLeafValues(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    // dp[i][j]: minimum cost to build tree from arr[i] to arr[j]
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    // maxLeaf[i][j]: maximum leaf value in arr[i] to arr[j]
    const maxLeaf = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Initialize maxLeaf
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxLeaf[i][i] = arr[i];
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            maxLeaf[i][j] = Math.max(maxLeaf[i][j-1], arr[j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Fill dp array
    for (let length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i + length - 1 < n; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            if (i == j) {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            } else {
                for (let k = i; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 
                                        dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + maxLeaf[i][k] * maxLeaf[k + 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n - 1];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(mctFromLeafValues([6, 2, 4])); // Output: 32
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing maxLeaf:** `O(n^2)` time complexity since we need to calculate the maximum value for every subarray.
- **Filling dp array:** `O(n^3)` time complexity because for each subarray `[i, j]`, we try all possible split points `k`. There are `O(n^2)` subarrays, and for each subarray, the checking of split points takes `O(n)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^3)`. For `n` up to 40, this should be efficient enough.
