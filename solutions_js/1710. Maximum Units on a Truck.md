[Leetcode 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1710)
### Problem Statement

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where:
- `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes(i), numberOfUnitsPerBox(i)]`.

- `numberOfBoxes(i)` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBox(i)` is the number of units in each box of type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You need to maximize the total number of units that can be put on the truck.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type with 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type with 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type with 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be:
1 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the approach if there are multiple ways to fill the truck?**
   - The approach should aim to maximize the total number of units.

2. **Is it possible for `boxTypes` to be empty or `truckSize` to be zero?**
   - No, `boxTypes` will contain at least one box type and `truckSize` will be positive.

3. **Are the number of units per box always positive? Can they be zero?**
   - The number of units per box will be positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the `boxTypes` array based on the number of units per box in descending order**. This helps in picking boxes with the highest units first.
2. **Iterate through the sorted array**, adding boxes to the truck in a greedy manner until the truck is full or the box types are exhausted.
3. **Keep track of the total units loaded onto the truck.**

### Code

```javascript
var maximumUnits = function(boxTypes, truckSize) {
    // Sort boxTypes based on the units per box in descending order
    boxTypes.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
    
    let totalUnits = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < boxTypes.length; i++) {
        let numberOfBoxes = boxTypes[i][0];
        let unitsPerBox = boxTypes[i][1];
        
        if (truckSize >= numberOfBoxes) {
            // If we can take all boxes of the current type
            totalUnits += numberOfBoxes * unitsPerBox;
            truckSize -= numberOfBoxes;
        } else {
            // If we can only take part of the boxes of the current type
            totalUnits += truckSize * unitsPerBox;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return totalUnits;
};

// Example usage:
// console.log(maximumUnits([[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1]], 4)); // Output: 8
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of types of boxes.
- **Iterating through the list**: The iteration step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
