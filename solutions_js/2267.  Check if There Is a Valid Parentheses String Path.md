[Leetcode 2267.  Check if There Is a Valid Parentheses String Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2267)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` grid of parentheses `grid`. A valid parentheses string path is a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner such that:
1. The number of opening parentheses `'('` matches the number of closing parentheses `')'` at every point.
2. The parentheses string formed by the cells visited along the way forms a valid parentheses string.

Return `true` if there exists a valid parentheses string path, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Dimensions:** Can the grid be non-square (i.e., `m` â‰  `n`)? 
   - Yes, `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns) can be different.
2. **Grid Content:** Are there any other characters in the grid other than `'('` and `')'`?
   - No, the grid contains only characters `'('` and `')'`.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming with DFS/Backtracking:** Use a DFS or backtracking approach combined with memoization to traverse the grid while maintaining the balance of parentheses.
2. **State Representation:** A state can be represented by `(i, j, balance)`, where 
   - `i` and `j` are coordinates in the grid,
   - `balance` represents the number of `'('` minus the number of `')'` up to that point.
3. **Base Conditions:**
   - If at any point the balance becomes negative, the path cannot be valid.
   - If the balance is non-zero after reaching the bottom-right corner, the path is invalid.
4. **Memoization:** Store results of intermediate states to avoid re-computation and reduce time complexity.

### Code
Here's how we can implement the solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} grid
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasValidPath = function(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let memo = {};

    function dfs(row, col, balance) {
        // If the balance ever goes negative, it's invalid
        if (balance < 0) return false;

        // If we have reached the bottom-right corner
        if (row === rows - 1 && col === cols - 1) {
            return balance === 0;
        }

        // Memoization key
        const key = `${row},${col},${balance}`;
        if (key in memo) return memo[key];

        // Explore the next positions (right and down)
        let valid = false;
        if (row + 1 < rows) {  // Move down
            valid = valid || dfs(row + 1, col, balance + (grid[row + 1][col] === '(' ? 1 : -1));
        }
        if (col + 1 < cols) {  // Move right
            valid = valid || dfs(row, col + 1, balance + (grid[row][col + 1] === '(' ? 1 : -1));
        }

        // Memoize the result for this state
        memo[key] = valid;
        return valid;
    }

    // Start DFS from the top-left corner and initial balance
    // Initial balance: 1 if it's '(', -1 if it's ')' (returns false immediately if top-left is ')')
    if (grid[0][0] === ')') return false;
    return dfs(0, 0, 1);
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- There are `O(m * n)` cells in the grid.
- Each cell can be visited with a unique `balance`.
- In the worst case, the balance can range from `-m * n` to `m * n`.

Thus, the complexity is `O(m * n * (m * n))` considering memoization.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is:
- `O(m * n * (m * n))` for the memoization storage.
- `O(m + n)` for the recursion stack, which is the max depth of recursive calls (worst case).

This makes the overall space complexity `O(m * n * (m * n))`.
