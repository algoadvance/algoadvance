[Leetcode 2497. Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2497)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by a list of edges and a list of node values. Calculate the maximum star sum of any node in the graph. 

A star is defined as one central node and all nodes directly connected to it (its neighbors). The star sum is the sum of the values of the central node and all its neighbors.

- The edges list consists of pairs of integers representing connections between nodes.
- The node values list consists of integers representing the values of each node.

You need to return the highest star sum for any of the nodes in the graph.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there negative values in node values?
   - Yes, values can be negative.
   
2. Is the graph always connected?
   - No, the graph may have disconnected components.
   
3. Are self-loops (edges connecting a node to itself) possible?
   - Assume no self-loops unless specified otherwise.

4. Are there constraints on the number of edges or the number of nodes?
   - This would generally be specified in more detail in the problem description.

## Strategy

1. **Build the Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph from the given edges.

2. **Calculate Star Sums:**
   - For each node, calculate the star sum by summing the value of the node and the values of all its neighbors.

3. **Track the Maximum Star Sum:**
   - Iterate through each node, compute its star sum, and track the maximum encountered star sum.

## Code

```javascript
function maxStarSum(edges, values) {
    // Initialize adjacency list
    const adjList = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        adjList[i] = [];
    }

    // Fill adjacency list from edges
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push(v);
        adjList[v].push(u);
    }

    let maxStarSum = -Infinity;

    // Compute the maximum star sum
    for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
        let starSum = values[i];

        for (const neighbor of adjList[i]) {
            starSum += values[neighbor];
        }

        maxStarSum = Math.max(maxStarSum, starSum);
    }

    return maxStarSum;
}

// Example Usage:
// Edges: [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
// Values: [1, 2, 3]
// Nodes: 0, 1, 2 form a triangle. The star sums will be 6, 6, and 6 respectively.
// Expected output: 6

const edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]];
const values = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(maxStarSum(edges, values)); // Outputs: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Adjacency List:** O(E) where E is the number of edges.
- **Calculating Star Sums:** O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices/nodes (Each node's neighbors are processed once).

Overall, the time complexity is O(V + E), which is efficient for typical graph problems.
