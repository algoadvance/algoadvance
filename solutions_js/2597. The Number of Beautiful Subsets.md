[Leetcode 2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2597)
Certainly! Let's tackle this problem together.

### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers and a positive integer `k`, you need to find the number of non-empty beautiful subsets. A subset is considered beautiful if there are no two distinct elements `i` and `j` in the subset such that `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`.

Return the number of beautiful subsets of the array.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: nums = [2, 4, 6], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The beautiful subsets are [2], [4], [6], and [2, 6].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the subset required to be of any specific length?**
   - No, subsets can be of any length, as long as they are non-empty.

2. **Can nums have duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the problem doesn't restrict the input array from having duplicate elements.

3. **Are the elements of the array sorted?**
   - Not necessarily. We need to handle the general case where the input array might not be sorted.

4. **Is the input size constrained?**
   - The constraints have not been specified in the example, so let's assume typical LeetCode constraints where the array length could be relatively large, and optimize accordingly.

### Strategy

1. **Subset Generation:** 
   - We need to generate all possible non-empty subsets of the array.
   
2. **Check Subset Validity:** 
   - For each subset, check if it satisfies the beautiful condition (`|nums[i] - nums[j]| != k`).
   
3. **Count Valid Subsets:** 
   - Count and return the number of valid subsets.

4. **Optimization:** 
   - Since generating all possible subsets (which is `2^n - 1` non-empty subsets for an array of length `n`) and then checking each subset's validity can be slow for larger `n`, we might need to consider smarter ways to prune the search space.

### Solution Code

```javascript
const beautifulSubsets = (nums, k) => {
  let count = 0;
  
  // Helper function to generate subsets recursively
  const generateSubsets = (index, currentSubset) => {
    // For all non-empty subsets
    if (currentSubset.length > 0) {
      if (isBeautiful(currentSubset, k)) {
        count++;
      }
    }
    
    for (let i = index; i < nums.length; i++) {
      currentSubset.push(nums[i]);
      generateSubsets(i + 1, currentSubset);
      currentSubset.pop();
    }
  };

  // Helper function to check is a subset is beautiful
  const isBeautiful = (subset, k) => {
    const set = new Set(subset);
    for (let num of subset) {
      if (set.has(num - k) || set.has(num + k)) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  };

  // Initialize recursive generation of subsets
  generateSubsets(0, []);

  return count;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 4, 6];
const k = 2;
console.log(beautifulSubsets(nums, k));  // Expected Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The approach here involves generating all subsets of the array. For an array of length `n`, there are `2^n` subsets:

1. **Subset Generation:** `O(2^n)`
2. **Subset Validation:** Each validation can take `O(n)` in the worst case.
3. **Overall Time Complexity:** 
   - Since each subset can take `O(n)` time to validate and there are `2^n` subsets, the total time complexity is `O(n * 2^n)`.

This solution may not be the most efficient for large arrays due to the exponential complexity, but it is straightforward and correct.

If the input size constraints require more efficiency, we would need to delve deeper into optimizations or dynamic programming approaches to prune the search space.
