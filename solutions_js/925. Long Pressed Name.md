[Leetcode 925. Long Pressed Name](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l925)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with validating whether a string `name` can be considered as a "long-pressed" version of a given string. A string is considered as long-pressed if characters are repeated a number of times in sequence due to long presses on the keyboard.

#### Example:

```plaintext
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: True

Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: False
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `typed` have fewer characters than `name`?
2. Are all characters in `name` and `typed` lowercase letters?
3. Should we consider `typed` to always be a valid long-pressed form or could there be cases where the input might be invalid due to other reasons like extra characters?

Assumption: 
- `typed` cannot be shorter than `name`.
- Both `name` and `typed` consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

We'll use two pointers to solve this problem efficiently:

1. Create two pointers, `i` for iterating through `name`, and `j` for iterating through `typed`.
2. Navigate `typed` and `name` while ensuring characters match and dealing with the long-pressed characters.
3. If the current characters of `name` and `typed` match, increment both pointers.
4. If the current character of `typed` matches the previous character in `name` (thus covering a long-pressed key), increment only the `typed` pointer.
5. If neither condition holds, return `False`.
6. After the loop, check if all characters in `name` were checked (`i` should be equal to `name.length`).

### Code

```javascript
function isLongPressedName(name, typed) {
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (j < typed.length) {
        if (i < name.length && name[i] === typed[j]) {
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (j > 0 && typed[j] === typed[j - 1]) {
            j++;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return i === name.length;
}

// Test the function with some example cases
console.log(isLongPressedName("alex", "aaleex")); // Output: true
console.log(isLongPressedName("saeed", "ssaaedd")); // Output: false
console.log(isLongPressedName("leelee", "lleeelee")); // Output: true
console.log(isLongPressedName("laiden", "laidena")); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `name` and `m` is the length of `typed`. Each character from both strings is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently validate the string `typed` being a long-pressed version of `name` using minimal resources.
