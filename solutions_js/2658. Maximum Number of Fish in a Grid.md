[Leetcode 2658. Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2658)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an `m x n` grid representing an ocean. The grid contains integer values where:
- A value represents the quantity of fish in that cell, and specifically,
  - `0` signifies water with no fish.
  - Any positive integer signifies the count of fish in that cell.
- You can start at any cell and move to other cells in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right). You cannot move to a cell with a value of `0`.

Your task is to find the maximum number of fish you can collect when moving starting from any cell in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can we move diagonally?
   - No, movement is restricted to up, down, left, and right.
   
2. Are there any negative values in the grid?
   - No, the grid only contains non-negative integers where `0` signifies no fish.

3. Does traversal stop if moving to cells with value 0?
   - Yes, you can't move to cells with a value of `0`.

With these clarifications, let's proceed to solving the problem.

### Strategy:

1. **Traversal and Collection**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore and collect fish from all connected cells starting from any cell with fish.
   - Sum up the fish while traversing and keep track of the maximum fish collected from any DFS traversal.
   
2. **Implementation**:
   - For each cell in the grid, if it has fish (`> 0`), start a DFS.
   - During DFS, mark visited cells to avoid revisiting and sum up the fish count in the connected component.
   - Keep updating the maximum fish collected during each traversal.

3. **Base Conditions**:
   - Check boundaries to ensure you're within the grid.
   - Stop if a cell has been visited or contains `0`.

### Time Complexity:
- Each cell is visited once in the worst case, making the time complexity O(m*n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

### Code:

```javascript
function maxFish(grid) {
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];  // right, down, left, up
    let m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    let maxFish = 0;

    function dfs(x, y, visited) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] === 0 || visited[x][y]) {
            return 0;
        }

        visited[x][y] = true;  // mark the cell as visited
        let fishCount = grid[x][y];  // fish in the current cell

        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            let newX = x + dx, newY = y + dy;
            fishCount += dfs(newX, newY, visited);
        }

        return fishCount;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                let visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
                maxFish = Math.max(maxFish, dfs(i, j, visited));
            }
        }
    }

    return maxFish;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    [0, 2, 1],
    [3, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 0]
];
console.log(maxFish(grid));  // Output should be the max number of fish collected.
```

This approach ensures all connected components of fish are explored, and the maximum fish count is tracked and returned. This method effectively and efficiently handles the problem within the defined constraints.
