[Leetcode 1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1769)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` is '0' if the `i-th` box is empty and '1' if it contains a ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box (i.e., from box `i` to box `i+1` or from box `i` to box `i-1`). The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to move all balls to each box and return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `i-th` box.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be several balls in a single box, or is it strictly one ball per box where there is a `1`?
   - Only binary values are allowed; hence it is one ball per box where there is a `1`.

2. Is the number of boxes (length of the string) within a specific size limit?
   - The problem does not specify explicit limits, but for constraint purposes, assume it fits within typical LeetCode constraints (e.g., up to `10^4`).

### Strategy

1. **Initial Thought**: For each box, consider each other box, compute the distance, and sum these values. This brute-force solution involves a nested loop.
   
2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Precompute the cumulative distances from the left and the right for all boxes containing balls.
   - Use two accumulators:
     - `left_to_right_ops`: Number of operations to move all balls from the start till the current index (left to right).
     - `right_to_left_ops`: Number of operations to move all balls from the end till the current index (right to left).

3. **Steps**:
   - Traverse from left to right accumulating distances.
   - Traverse from right to left accumulating distances.
   - Combine results to get the minimum operations for each box.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} boxes
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var minOperations = function(boxes) {
    const n = boxes.length;
    const answer = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Left pass
    let ops = 0;
    let balls = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        answer[i] += ops;
        if (boxes[i] === '1') {
            balls++;
        }
        ops += balls;
    }

    // Right pass
    ops = 0;
    balls = 0;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        answer[i] += ops;
        if (boxes[i] === '1') {
            balls++;
        }
        ops += balls;
    }
    
    return answer;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Each pass (left-to-right and right-to-left) is O(n).
  - Combining the results is O(n).

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The `answer` array uses O(n) additional space.

This approach ensures we calculate the minimum operations efficiently, staying within linear time complexity relative to the number of boxes, which is suitable for large inputs up to `10^4`.
