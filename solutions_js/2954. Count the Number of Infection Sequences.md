[Leetcode 2954. Count the Number of Infection Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2954)
### Problem Statement

You are given the following:
- An integer `n` representing the number of people.
- A 2D array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a direct connection between person `a_i` and person `b_i`.

A person who is infected has the potential to infect other people through these direct connections. We need to count the number of possible sequences in which people can get infected.

You do not need to worry about duplicate sequences.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Infection Process**: Is it assumed that an infected person at time `t` can infect connected persons at time `t+1`?
2. **Directionality**: Are the edges undirected, meaning if person `a` is connected to person `b`, person `b` is also connected to person `a`?
3. **Initial Infection**: Is there any person initially infected, or do we consider every person as a potential starting point?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the relationships between people.
2. **DFS/BFS Traversal**: Implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible sequences of infection. Use a set to track visited nodes and manage unique sequences.
3. **Memoization**: To optimize, use memoization to avoid recomputing sequences from previously computed states.

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the graph using adjacency list: **O(E)**
- Traversing the graph to find all sequences: **O(n!)** in the worst case (which is the number of permutations of n people)

Given the problem is about finding sequences, it inherently involves exploring potential exponential solutions.

### Implementation in JavaScript

Here's a potential way to solve this problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
 */
var countInfectionSequences = function(n, edges) {
    // Step 1: Create adjacency list to represent graph
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    edges.forEach(([u, b]) => {
        graph[u].push(b);
        graph[b].push(u); // Since it's undirected
    });

    let totalSequences = 0;

    const dfs = (node, seen) => {
        seen.add(node);
        let uniqueSequenceFound = false;

        for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (!seen.has(neighbor)) {
                uniqueSequenceFound = true;
                dfs(neighbor, new Set(seen)); // Clone the seen set for each path
            }
        }

        // If no new node to infect, this is a valid end of a unique sequence
        if (!uniqueSequenceFound) {
            totalSequences++;
        }
    };

    // Step 2: Try to initiate infection from each node
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dfs(i, new Set());
    }

    return totalSequences;
};

// Example Usage
const n = 3; // number of people
const edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]; // relationships between people
console.log(countInfectionSequences(n, edges)); // Output: number of unique infection sequences
```

### Explanation

- **Adjacency List Construction**: We build a graph using an adjacency list.
- **DFS Traversal**: For each node, we perform a DFS to explore all possible ways to infect nodes. We use a set to keep track of visited nodes in each path to avoid revisiting.
- **Count Sequences**: We increment our counter each time we reach the end of a unique path, indicating a valid infection sequence.

This approach ensures that we count all unique sequences while managing the complexity with the help of DFS.
