[Leetcode 347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l347)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array include negative integers?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Is it possible for `k` to be greater than the number of unique elements in the array?**
   - No, `0 < k <= the number of unique elements`.

3. **Can we assume that the input data fits into memory?**
   - Yes.

4. **Can elements have the same frequency?**
   - Yes, there can be multiple elements with the same frequency, but we only need to return exactly `k` elements.

### Example
```javascript
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

### Code

```javascript
function topKFrequent(nums, k) {
    // Step 1: Create a frequency map
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (freqMap.has(num)) {
            freqMap.set(num, freqMap.get(num) + 1);
        } else {
            freqMap.set(num, 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Create an array of the frequency map's keys sorted by their frequency
    const sortedByFrequency = Array.from(freqMap.keys()).sort((a, b) => freqMap.get(b) - freqMap.get(a));
    
    // Step 3: Get the top k elements
    return sortedByFrequency.slice(0, k);
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Map Creation**:
    - Traverse through the array `nums` and create a frequency map to count the occurrences of each element. This step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.

2. **Sorting the Frequency Map Keys**:
    - Convert the keys of the frequency map into an array and sort it based on their frequency in descending order. Sorting has a time complexity of \(O(m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique elements in `nums`.

3. **Extracting the Top K Frequent Elements**:
    - Extract the first `k` elements from the sorted array. This step has a time complexity of \(O(k)\).

Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\), where \(m \leq n\).

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Frequency Map Creation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Sorting the Frequency Map Keys**: \(O(m \log m)\)
- **Extracting Top K Elements**: \(O(k)\)

Hence, the total time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\), which should be efficient for most input sizes typically seen in interview problems.
