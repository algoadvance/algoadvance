[Leetcode 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l847)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected, connected graph with \( n \) nodes labeled from 0 to \( n-1 \). The graph is given as an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph be disconnected?**
   - No, the graph is connected as stated in the problem.
2. **Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between nodes?**
   - The problem states that it is a simple graph, so there are no self-loops or multiple edges between two nodes.
3. **Can the graph be empty?**
   - No, since there's always at least one node (`n` is at least 1).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach in combination with bit masking to keep track of the visited nodes efficiently. Here's the plan:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a queue for BFS which stores tuples of (current_node, visited_mask, current_length).
   - `visited_mask` is a bitmask where the ith bit is set if the ith node has been visited.
   - `current_length` keeps track of the number of edges taken so far.

2. **BFS Execution:**
   - Iterate through the queue, expanding the search from each currently visited node to its neighbors while updating the `visited_mask`.
   - If all nodes have been visited (i.e., `visited_mask` equals `(1 << n) - 1`), return the `current_length` since it represents the shortest path that visits all nodes.

3. **Avoid Cycles:**
   - Use a set to store the state as (current_node, visited_mask) to avoid revisiting the same state and create infinite loops.

### Code

```javascript
function shortestPathLength(graph) {
    const n = graph.length;
    const final_state = (1 << n) - 1;
    const queue = [];
    const seen = new Set();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const state = (1 << i);
        queue.push([i, state, 0]);
        seen.add(`${i}-${state}`);
    }
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [node, state, length] = queue.shift();
        
        if (state === final_state) {
            return length;
        }
        
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            const nextState = state | (1 << neighbor);
            const nextStr = `${neighbor}-${nextState}`;
            
            if (!seen.has(nextStr)) {
                queue.push([neighbor, nextState, length + 1]);
                seen.add(nextStr);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \cdot 2^n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes.
  - This is because there are \( n \) possible starting nodes and \( 2^n \) possible states for each node in the worst case.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n \cdot 2^n) \) for storing the queue and the seen set. Each state can be stored for up to \( n \) nodes with \( 2^n \) different masks.
