[Leetcode 650. 2 Keys Keyboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l650)
### Problem Statement
Write a function to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly `n` 'A' characters on the notepad, starting with one 'A'. You can perform only two operations:

1. Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
2. Paste: You can paste the characters copied last time.

#### Example:
```text
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Initially, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All.
In step 2, we use Paste to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste again to get 'AAA'.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be less than or equal to zero?**
    - No, `n` will always be a positive integer.
2. **Are there any constraints on `n`?**
    - The value of n will be within the range `[1, 1000]` as per typical constraint sizes in such problems.

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using the concept of finding factors:

1. For any target `n`, the goal is to make the number by copying smaller chunks multiple times. Hence, we'll need to break down `n` into smaller operations involving fewer copies and pastes.
2. We can find how many smaller steps are required by examining the divisors of `n`. For example, if `n` can be divided into parts where you can simply paste multiple times after copying, then the sum of these operations will give us a minimal number of steps.
3. The key is to break down `n` using its factors starting from the smallest factor > 1.

### Code
Hereâ€™s an implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var minSteps = function(n) {
    // To store number of operations needed
    let operations = 0;
    
    // Start checking from the smallest prime factor
    for (let factor = 2; factor <= n; factor++) {
        while (n % factor === 0) {
            operations += factor;
            n = n / factor;
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
};
```

### Explanation
1. We initialize `operations` to 0, which will count the total operations needed.
2. We start from the smallest possible factor (2). For every factor, if `n` is divisible by that factor, we repeatedly divide `n` by the factor and add the factor to our operations count.
3. The loop runs until `factor` is less than or equal to `n`:
    - If `n` is divisible by `factor`, it means you can `paste` that factor number of `"A"`s multiple times and achieve the total `n`.
4. Finally, the function returns the total number of operations needed.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(sqrt(n))` because we are iterating up to the square root of `n` due to reducing `n` by its factors repeatedly. The function is efficient even for larger values of `n` within the constraints (1 <= n <= 1000).
