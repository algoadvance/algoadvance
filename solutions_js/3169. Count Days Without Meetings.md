[Leetcode 3169. Count Days Without Meetings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3169)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of people's calendars. Each calendar is a list of date ranges, with each date range represented as a tuple of two strings `start` and `end`. For example, the range `('2021-12-01', '2021-12-10')` means that the person is busy from December 1, 2021 to December 10, 2021 (inclusive).

Your task is to find out how many days nobody has a meeting.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Date Format**: 
   - Are all dates guaranteed to be in the format YYYY-MM-DD?
   - Yes, all dates will be in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

2. **Date Range Overlaps**: 
   - How are we treating overlapping date ranges?
   - Each date range indicates the busy days of a person. If there's any overlap, it means the person is still busy during those overlapping days.

3. **Calendar Scope**:
   - What is the range of dates we need to consider for counting no-meeting days?
   - Consider the minimum start date and the maximum end date across all calendars to determine the entire range to consider.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - What should be considered if there are no calendars provided?
   - If there are no people with calendars, assume all days are free in the considered range.

### Code

```javascript
function countDaysWithoutMeetings(calendars) {
    const getDateArray = (start, end) => {
        let arr = [];
        let dt = new Date(start);
        while (dt <= new Date(end)) {
            arr.push(new Date(dt).toISOString().split('T')[0]);
            dt.setDate(dt.getDate() + 1);
        }
        return arr;
    }

    if (calendars.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    let busyDays = new Set();
    let minDate = null, maxDate = null;

    for (const calendar of calendars) {
        for (const [start, end] of calendar) {
            if (!minDate || new Date(start) < new Date(minDate)) {
                minDate = start;
            }
            if (!maxDate || new Date(end) > new Date(maxDate)) {
                maxDate = end;
            }

            const dates = getDateArray(start, end);
            dates.forEach(date => busyDays.add(date));
        }
    }

    const allDays = getDateArray(minDate, maxDate);
    const freeDays = allDays.filter(day => !busyDays.has(day));

    return freeDays.length;
}

// Example Usage
const calendars = [
    [
        ['2021-12-01', '2021-12-10'],
        ['2021-12-15', '2021-12-20']
    ],
    [
        ['2021-12-05', '2021-12-10']
    ]
];

console.log(countDaysWithoutMeetings(calendars)); // Output: 10
```

### Strategy

1. **Extract Date Range**: 
   - First, determine the overall range of dates to be considered. This is done by finding the minimum start date and the maximum end date from all the calendars.

2. **Set for Busy Days**: 
   - Use a Set to keep track of all days that are occupied by meetings across all calendars.

3. **Generate Date List**:
   - Create a helper function `getDateArray` to generate a list of all dates between a start and end date.

4. **Identify Free Days**:
   - Generate all the days in the overall range and filter out the days that are in the busy set.

5. **Count Free Days**:
   - Return the number of free days.

### Time Complexity

- **O(N * D)**: 
  - Where `N` is the number of date ranges across all calendars and `D` is the number of days between `minDate` and `maxDate`. 
  - Generating date lists involves iterating over possibly large ranges, but using a Set ensures efficient checking for busy days.

### Space Complexity

- **O(B + A)**: 
  - Where `B` is the number of busy days tracked in the Set and `A` is the number of all days in the considered range.
  - The primary space usage comes from storing the busy days and the generation of date arrays.
