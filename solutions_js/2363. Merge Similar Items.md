[Leetcode 2363. Merge Similar Items](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2363)
### Problem Statement
- **Description:**
  You are given two 2D integer arrays `items1` and `items2` representing items, where each array represents a collection of items, and each item is represented as a pair of integers `[value, weight]`.
  - Items with the same value should be merged, and the weights of those items should be summed up.
- **Requirements:**
  - Return a 2D array `result` where each element is a pair `[value, totalWeight]` that represents the merged value and total weight of items with the same value.
  - The `result` array should be sorted in increasing order based on the value.

**Example:**
```js
Input: items1 = [[1,1], [4,5], [3,8]], items2 = [[3,1], [1,5]]
Output: [[1, 6], [3, 9], [4, 5]]
Explanation: 
- The items with value 1 have a total weight of 6 (1 from items1 and 5 from items2).
- The items with value 3 have a total weight of 9 (8 from items1 and 1 from items2).
- The item with value 4 has a total weight of 5 (only from items1).
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the number of items in `items1` and `items2`?
   - What are the constraints on the values and weights of the items?
2. **Output Order:**
   - Can we assume the values in the output should be sorted in ascending order as specified?

### Strategy
1. **Data Structuring:**
   - Use a JavaScript object (or Map) to accumulate the weights of items where the key is the item’s value and the value is the sum of the weights.
2. **Merging Items:**
   - Traverse both `items1` and `items2`, and for each item update the corresponding entry in the map.
3. **Sorting and Constructing Result:**
   - Convert the map’s entries back into an array of `[value, totalWeight]` pairs.
   - Sort the array based on the values.

### Code
```javascript
function mergeSimilarItems(items1, items2) {
    const weightMap = new Map();

    // Helper function to add items to the map
    function addItemToMap(items) {
        for (const [value, weight] of items) {
            if (weightMap.has(value)) {
                weightMap.set(value, weightMap.get(value) + weight);
            } else {
                weightMap.set(value, weight);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Populate the map with items1 and items2
    addItemToMap(items1);
    addItemToMap(items2);

    // Create the resulting array
    const result = [];
    for (const [value, totalWeight] of weightMap.entries()) {
        result.push([value, totalWeight]);
    }

    // Sort the result by the value
    result.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Merging items:** O(n + m) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `items1` and `items2` respectively.
- **Sorting the result:** O(k log k) where `k` is the number of unique item values, derived from the operation on the map.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **Overall:** O(n + m + k log k) where `k` is the number of unique values after merging.

This approach efficiently handles merging and sorting tasks within the constraints typically expected in these scenarios.
