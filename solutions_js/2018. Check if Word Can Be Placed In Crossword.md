[Leetcode 2018. Check if Word Can Be Placed In Crossword](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2018)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board`, representing a crossword puzzle. The crossword contains lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'), blank spaces represented by `' '`, and blocked cells represented by `'#'`.

You are also given a string `word`, which needs to be placed either horizontally or vertically on the board. The word must be placed in a sequence of contiguous blank spaces or those that exactly match the characters in the word. Cells marked with '#' cannot be used.

Return `true` if the word can be placed on the crossword, and `false` otherwise.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: board = [["#"," ","#"],[" "," ","#"],["#","c"," "]], word = "abc"
Output: false

Input: board = [["#"," ","#"],[" ","c"," "],["#"," ","#"]], word = "cbc"
Output: true
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the board have words already present besides just blocks and spaces?
    - From the problem description, it seems like it will only have blocks, blank spaces, or single letters.
2. Can the word be placed both horizontally and vertically?
    - Yes, the word can be placed either horizontally or vertically.
3. Are there any specific constraints on the dimensions of the board or length of the word?
    - No specific constraints given beyond typical input constraints, likely within reasonable limits for a coding problem (e.g., no more than 1000x1000 for the board size).

## Strategy

1. **Traversal**: Iterate through each cell in the board:
    - For each cell, try to place the `word` horizontally and vertically.
2. **Validation**:
    - Check if placing the word starting from the current cell either horizontally or vertically doesn't overflow the board boundary.
    - Ensure each character in the board at the position of the character in the word is either a blank space `' '` or matches the word character exactly.
3. If any position in the board allows placing the word, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Time Complexity

- **Traversal**: O(m * n) for scanning each cell.
- **Validation**: O(L) for each word validation where L is the length of the word.
- **Overall**: O(m * n * L).

## Code

Here is the complete solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var placeWordInCrossword = function(board, word) {
    const m = board.length;
    const n = board[0].length;
    const wordLength = word.length;

    const canPlaceHorizontally = (row, col) => {
        if (col + wordLength > n) return false;
        if (col > 0 && board[row][col - 1] !== '#') return false;
        if (col + wordLength < n && board[row][col + wordLength] !== '#') return false;

        for (let i = 0; i < wordLength; i++) {
            if (board[row][col + i] !== ' ' && board[row][col + i] !== word.charAt(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    const canPlaceVertically = (row, col) => {
        if (row + wordLength > m) return false;
        if (row > 0 && board[row - 1][col] !== '#') return false;
        if (row + wordLength < m && board[row + wordLength][col] !== '#') return false;

        for (let i = 0; i < wordLength; i++) {
            if (board[row + i][col] !== ' ' && board[row + i][col] !== word.charAt(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === ' ' || board[i][j] === word.charAt(0)) {
                if (canPlaceHorizontally(i, j) || canPlaceVertically(i, j)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};
```

This implementation ensures that the word is tested for potential placement in every possible starting cell, both horizontally and vertically.
