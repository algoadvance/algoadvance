[Leetcode 2611. Mice and Cheese](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2611)
### Problem Statement

2611. Mice and Cheese

There are two mice and n different types of cheese, each type of cheese has a certain value. You are given a list `cheese_values` where `cheese_values[i]` represents the value of the i-th type of cheese. The n types of cheese are arranged in a row, and the mice start from opposite ends of the row. The first mouse can only eat the cheese from the left end of the row, and the second mouse can only eat the cheese from the right end of the row. 

The two mice will eat one type of cheese each in turn, starting from the left by the first mouse and from the right by the second mouse, and they will move towards each other.

You need to find the maximum sum of values of cheese that both mice can eat in this manner.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of the `cheese_values` array?
    - Are there any negative values in `cheese_values`?

2. **Behavioral Questions**:
    - Should we consider the scenario where both mice eat all the cheese?
    - Are the mice allowed to skip a cheese if it's of lower value?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can employ a two-pointer technique. We will place one pointer at the beginning of the array (left side) and another pointer at the end of the array (right side). These pointers will simulate the movement of the two mice.

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize left pointer at the start (`left = 0`) and right pointer at the end (`right = n - 1`).
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum sum of cheese values that both mice can eat.
3. Iterate through the cheese values while `left <= right`.
    - Add the value at the left pointer to the sum.
    - Add the value at the right pointer to the sum.
    - Move the left pointer to the right (`left++`) and the right pointer to the left (`right--`).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of types of cheese. This is because we only need to traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Code

```javascript
function maxCheeseValue(cheese_values) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = cheese_values.length - 1;
    let sum = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        if (left === right) {
            sum += cheese_values[left];
        } else {
            sum += cheese_values[left];
            sum += cheese_values[right];
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
const cheeseValues = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
console.log(maxCheeseValue(cheeseValues));  // Outputs: 30
```

The above code correctly calculates the maximum sum of cheese values that both mice can eat starting from opposite ends and moving towards each other. The while loop ensures that both mice alternately pick cheeses from each end. When they meet in the middle (when `left === right`), only one value is added once to the sum.
