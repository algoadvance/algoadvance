[Leetcode 2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2022)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array `original`, as well as two integers, `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all the elements from `original`.

The elements should be filled row-wise. More formally, the 2D array should have the structure: 
   * result[i][j] = original[i * n + j]

If it is not possible to construct such a 2D array, return an empty 2D array.

### Example:
#### Example 1:
- Input: `original = [1,2,3,4]`, `m = 2`, `n = 2`
- Output: `[[1,2],[3,4]]`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `original = [1,2,3]`, `m = 1`, `n = 3`
- Output: `[[1,2,3]]`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `original = [1,2]`, `m = 1`, `n = 1`
- Output: `[]`
  - Explanation: The number of elements in the original array does not match the required matrix dimensions.

## Strategy
1. **Verify Input Dimensions**: Check if the length of `original` equals `m * n`. If not, return an empty 2D array.
2. **Initialize the 2D Array**: Create a new array with `m` rows and `n` columns.
3. **Fill the 2D Array**: Iterate over the `original` array and populate the 2D array row by row.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `original` array contain negative numbers?
2. What is the expected behavior if `m` or `n` are zero or negative? (Assume m, n are positive integers based on the problem)
3. Should the solution handle cases where `m` or `n` are not integers?

## Code

```javascript
function convert1DArrayTo2DArray(original, m, n) {
    // Check if it's possible to reshape the original array
    if (original.length !== m * n) {
        return [];
    }
    
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        const row = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            row.push(original[i * n + j]);
        }
        result.push(row);
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(convert1DArrayTo2DArray([1,2,3,4], 2, 2)); // [[1,2],[3,4]]
console.log(convert1DArrayTo2DArray([1,2,3], 1, 3)); // [[1,2,3]]
console.log(convert1DArrayTo2DArray([1,2], 1, 1)); // []
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate over each element exactly once.

- The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** for storing the resulting 2D array.
