[Leetcode 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l865)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree. A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree. The subtree that contains all the deepest nodes should be the smallest such subtree that contains all these deepest nodes.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a subtree?**
   A subtree of a tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.

2. **What properties does the input tree possess?**
   The binary tree can have any configuration, including being skewed, balanced, etc. 

3. **Can the tree be empty?**
   The problem statement does not clarify, so we assume the input tree has at least one node.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the depth of each node and identify the deepest nodes. We can then determine the smallest subtree containing all these deepest nodes. The steps are:

1. Perform a DFS to determine the depth of each node.
2. During the DFS, track the maximum depth encountered.
3. Traverse the tree again to identify all nodes with the maximum depth.
4. Determine the smallest common ancestor for these nodes, which will be our answer.

## Code

Hereâ€™s a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

const subtreeWithAllDeepest = (root) => {
    let maxDepth = 0;
    let answer = null;

    const dfs = (node, depth) => {
        if (!node) return depth;
        
        const leftDepth = dfs(node.left, depth + 1);
        const rightDepth = dfs(node.right, depth + 1);
        
        const currentDepth = Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
        if (leftDepth === rightDepth && currentDepth >= maxDepth) {
            maxDepth = currentDepth;
            answer = node;
        }
        
        return currentDepth;
    };

    dfs(root, 0);
    return answer;
};

// Example usage:
// let root = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(1));
// console.log(subtreeWithAllDeepest(root));
```

## Time Complexity

- **Depth Calculation**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We perform a DFS to calculate the depth, which visits each node once.
- **Tracking Deepest Nodes**: O(N), during the DFS, we keep track of which node is the answer while calculating the depth.
- **Total**: O(N), since we are visiting every node in the tree a constant number of times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is linear, which is efficient for binary tree operations. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the recursion stack in the worst case of an unbalanced tree.
