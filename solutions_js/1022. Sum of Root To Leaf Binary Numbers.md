[Leetcode 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1022)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit. For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13` in decimal.

You need to compute the sum of these numbers for all root-to-leaf paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a root-to-leaf path?**
   A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root node and ending at any leaf node.
   
2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   Yes, the tree can be empty. In such a case, the result should be `0`.
   
3. **Do all leaf nodes need to be considered?**
   Yes, you need to calculate the binary numbers for all root-to-leaf paths.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We can use DFS to traverse from the root to the leaves.
2. **Binary Conversion on the Fly**: As we traverse, we keep a running sum that represents the current binary number.
3. **Leaf Check**: When we reach a leaf node, we add its corresponding binary number to our total sum.
4. **Node Value**: If we move left or right, we shift our current number left by 1 position (binary digit shift) and add the node value.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
function sumRootToLeaf(root) {
    // Helper function to perform DFS
    const dfs = (node, currentSum) => {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        // Update currentSum to include this node's value
        currentSum = (currentSum << 1) | node.val;

        // If it's a leaf node, return the currentSum
        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return currentSum;
        }

        // Otherwise, continue DFS for left and right subtrees
        return dfs(node.left, currentSum) + dfs(node.right, currentSum);
    }
    
    // Initialize DFS with root node and initial sum 0
    return dfs(root, 0);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This represents the space for the function call stack in a depth-first traversal. In the worst case, if the tree is completely unbalanced, this could be `O(N)`. In the average case for a balanced tree, it would be `O(log N)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the sum of all root-to-leaf binary numbers by leveraging depth-first search and bit manipulation.
