[Leetcode 1688. Count of Matches in Tournament](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1688)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, the number of teams in a tournament that uses the following rules:
1. If the number of teams is even, then each team gets paired with another team. A total of `n/2` matches are played, and `n/2` teams advance to the next round.
2. If the number of teams is odd, one team advances automatically, and the rest teams are paired with each other. A total of `(n - 1) / 2` matches are played, and `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance to the next round.

Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is `n` always greater than 1?
    - Yes, there will always be more than one team in the tournament.
  
2. What is the largest possible value for `n`?
    - The value of `n` can be up to \(10^9\).

3. Should we handle invalid inputs?
    - No, we can assume the input `n` is always a valid positive integer greater than 1.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves understanding that in each round:
- If the number of teams is even, the number of matches played is `n / 2`, and the same number of teams advance.
- If the number of teams is odd, the number of matches played is `(n - 1) / 2`, and one team advances automatically, then `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` teams advance.

We need to keep track of the total number of matches played until only one team remains.

1. Initialize `matches` to 0 to keep a tally of the total number of matches played.
2. While the number of teams `n` is greater than 1:
    - If `n` is even, calculate the number of matches as `n / 2` and add to `matches`; update `n` to `n / 2`.
    - If `n` is odd, calculate the number of matches as `(n - 1) / 2` and add to `matches`; update `n` to `(n - 1) / 2 + 1` (accounting for the team advancing automatically).
3. Return the total number of matches.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfMatches = function(n) {
    let matches = 0;
    while (n > 1) {
        if (n % 2 === 0) {
            matches += n / 2;
            n = n / 2;
        } else {
            matches += (n - 1) / 2;
            n = (n - 1) / 2 + 1;
        }
    }
    return matches;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\log n)\):
- Each iteration divides the number of teams `n` roughly in half.
- Therefore, the number of iterations required to reduce `n` to 1 is proportional to the logarithm (base 2) of `n`.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
