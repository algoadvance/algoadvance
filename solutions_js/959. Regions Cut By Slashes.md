[Leetcode 959. Regions Cut By Slashes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l959)
## Problem Statement

In a 2D grid of size `n x n`, each cell is either empty (denoted by a space `' '`), contains a forward slash (denoted by `'/'`), or contains a backslash (denoted by `'\'`). These slashes divide the square into regions. A region is a group of contiguous cells connected by the slashes.

Given such a grid, determine the number of regions.

**Example:**
```
Input:
grid = [
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem constraints will typically define the range. For now, we can assume `n` can be reasonably large, up to around 30.

2. **Can there be different sizes of input other than square grids?**
   - No, the problem specifies `n x n` grids.

3. **Are the slashes always valid within the grid bounds?**
   - Yes, they are always valid.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take the following approach:

- **Transform the grid**: Treat each cell as a 2x2 block to simplify working with the paths created by the slashes. Each 2x2 block can be represented as 4 different parts:
  - Index 0 (top-left)
  - Index 1 (top-right)
  - Index 2 (bottom-left)
  - Index 3 (bottom-right)

- **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage and merge these parts. Each slash will define connections in this 2x2 block:
  - A '/' creates two separate connections between Top-Right and Bottom-Left.
  - A '\' creates two separate connections between Top-Left and Bottom-Right.

- **Count Separate Regions**: Finally, use the Union-Find structure to count the number of different regions.

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
  constructor(size) {
    this.parent = Array(size).fill(0).map((_, index) => index);
    this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
  }

  find(x) {
    if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
      this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
    }
    return this.parent[x];
  }

  union(x, y) {
    const rootX = this.find(x);
    const rootY = this.find(y);

    if (rootX !== rootY) {
      if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
      } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
      } else {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        this.rank[rootX]++;
      }
    }
  }
}

var regionsBySlashes = function(grid) {
  const n = grid.length;
  const size = 4 * n * n;
  const uf = new UnionFind(size);

  for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
      const root = 4 * (r * n + c);
      const val = grid[r][c];

      // Connect internal parts of a single cell
      if (val === '/') {
        uf.union(root + 0, root + 3);
        uf.union(root + 1, root + 2);
      } else if (val === '\\') {
        uf.union(root + 0, root + 1);
        uf.union(root + 2, root + 3);
      } else {
        uf.union(root + 0, root + 1);
        uf.union(root + 1, root + 2);
        uf.union(root + 2, root + 3);
      }

      // Connect external parts to neighboring cells
      if (c < n - 1) { // right
        uf.union(root + 1, root + 4 + 3);
      }
      if (r < n - 1) { // below
        uf.union(root + 2, root + 4 * n + 0);
      }
    }
  }

  let regions = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (uf.find(i) === i) {
      regions++;
    }
  }

  return regions;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initial grid transformation and union setup**: O(n^2)
- **Union-Find operations (find and union)**: Nearly O(1) due to path compression and rank optimization, making it very efficient, almost O(n^2).

Overall, the complexity is **O(n^2)**, making this approach scalable for reasonably large values of `n`.
