[Leetcode 3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3102)
## Problem Statement

**3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances-out**

Given a `m x n` grid with the coordinates of `x` and `y` of a list of starting and ending points, determine the smallest possible Manhattan distance between any starting point to an ending point. The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is calculated as `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

The input will be:

1. `coords`: An array of coordinates, where each element is an object containing two properties:
  - `start`: Represents the starting coordinates, and is an array of two integers `[x, y]`.
  - `end`: Represents the ending coordinates, and is an array of two integers `[x, y]`.

Output the smallest possible Manhattan distance between any start and end point.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the coordinates guaranteed to be within the grid bounds?
2. Can there be multiple starting and ending points that are the same?
3. Will the input always be valid and non-empty?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `minDistance` to a large number (infinity).
2. Loop through each pair of starting and ending points.
3. Calculate the Manhattan distance for each pair using the formula `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.
4. Track the smallest distance in the `minDistance` variable.
5. Return the `minDistance`.

This approach ensures we check every possible start-end point pair and find the smallest Manhattan distance.

## Code

```javascript
function minimizeManhattanDistances(coords) {
    let minDistance = Infinity;

    coords.forEach(point => {
        const [x1, y1] = point.start;
        const [x2, y2] = point.end;
        const manhattanDistance = Math.abs(x1 - x2) + Math.abs(y1 - y2);
        minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, manhattanDistance);
    });

    return minDistance;
}

// Example usage:
const coordinates = [
    { start: [1, 2], end: [4, 6] },
    { start: [3, 4], end: [1, 2] }
];

console.log(minimizeManhattanDistances(coordinates)); // Output will be the smallest Manhattan distance
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of coordinate pairs in the input array. This is because we are iterating through each coordinate pair exactly once to calculate the Manhattan distance.
