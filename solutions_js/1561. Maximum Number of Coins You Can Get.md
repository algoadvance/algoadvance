[Leetcode 1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1561)
### Problem Statement
The problem is described as follows:

You have n piles of coins where n is divisible by 3, and you want to divide these coins among 3 people such that:
1. Each person gets an equal number of piles.
2. The "first" person gets the maximum number of coins possible.

You are given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the `i-th` pile.

To achieve the objective, you maximize the sum of coins obtained by the "first" person.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the values in the piles array be zero?**  
   Yes, there might be a pile with zero coins.

2. **Can the piles array be sorted initially?**  
   No, the array is not necessarily sorted initially; we might have to sort it during our solution.

3. **Is every element in the `piles` array a positive integer?**  
   Yes, each pile can contain a positive number of coins (including zero, if allowed).

4. **What is the range of `n`?**  
   This range will be clarified by constraints, but assume it is reasonably large and computationally feasible.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:
1. **Sort the piles array** in ascending order.
2. Since we want to maximize the coins for the "first" person, we need to be strategic about picking the largest possible values for them.
3. Once the array is sorted, to divide the piles:
   - The smallest third of the piles are irrelevant to the "first" person, so ignore these.
   - From the remaining piles (two-thirds of the array), alternately pick piles in such a way that the second person and the third person get the lower valued piles compared to the "first" person.
4. Specifically, starting from the second largest pile, take every second pile (reverse traverse).

### Code
```javascript
function maxCoins(piles) {
    // Sort the piles array
    piles.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let maxCoins = 0;
    let n = piles.length;
    
    // We take piles in groups of three, but we skip the smallest third.
    for (let i = n / 3; i < n; i += 2) {
        maxCoins += piles[i];
    }
    
    return maxCoins;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: We begin by sorting the array.
2. **Skipping smallest third**: Start iterating from `n / 3` which effectively skips the smallest third part of the array.
3. **Alternating picks**: Increase the index by 2 each time which ensures maximum coins are collected by the "first" person in every alternate selection from the bounds defined.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
- **Collecting coins**: `O(n/3)` simplifying to `O(n)` for the iteration over the second part of the array.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
