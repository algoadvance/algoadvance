[Leetcode 2527. Find Xor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2527)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array 'nums'. The `xor-beauty` of the array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all elements of the array with the bitwise XOR of all pairs of elements of the array with the bitwise XOR of all triplets of elements of the array. More formally, if 'nums' is the array, then the xor-beauty can be defined as follows:

$$ XorBeauty(nums) = ( \oplus nums[i] ) \oplus ( \oplus (nums[i] \oplus nums[j]) ) \oplus ( \oplus (nums[i] \oplus nums[j] \oplus nums[k]) ) $$

Where $\oplus$ is the XOR operation.

Implement the function to find the xor-beauty of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?**  
   No, it is guaranteed that the array has at least one element.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values of the elements?**  
   Yes, typical constraints to consider:
   - The length of the array can be up to \(10^5\).
   - Each element in the array can be between \(0\) and \(10^9\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's break down the XOR operations:

1. **Single Elements**: XOR of all elements directly in the array.
2. **Pairs of Elements**: XOR of all pairs $(nums[i] \oplus nums[j])$.
3. **Triplets of Elements**: XOR of all triplets $(nums[i] \oplus nums[j] \oplus nums[k])$.

Upon closer inspection of the XOR properties, we observe the following:
- Repeated XOR operations can neutralize elements (since \(a \oplus a = 0\)).
- Effectively, odd counts of repeated elements result in the element itself and even counts result in `0`.

Given these properties, the problem simplifies. As it turns out, the XOR of all elements can be computed directly without explicitly computing all pairs and triplets.

#### Main Insight:
The pairs and triplets of elements will effectively neutralize each other out, reducing the problem to the XOR of all individual elements.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function to compute the `xor-beauty` of the array:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var xorBeauty = function(nums) {
    let result = 0;
    
    // XOR all elements in the array
    for (let num of nums) {
        result ^= num;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we are performing a single pass over the array to compute the XOR.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

With this plan, the function efficiently computes the xor-beauty of the array in linear time.
