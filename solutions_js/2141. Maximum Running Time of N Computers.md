[Leetcode 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2141)
## Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 2141: Maximum Running Time of N Computers**

You have `n` computers and `m` battery packs. You are given an integer array `batteries` where the `i-th` battery can run a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You want to use these batteries to run all the `n` computers simultaneously.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that, you can replace any depleted battery with another battery from the battery pack. You would like to know the maximum number of minutes you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are all values in the `batteries` array positive integers?**
   - A: Yes, all battery timings are positive integers.
   
2. **Q: Can a battery be swapped between computers or once it is exhausted, it canâ€™t be used again?**
   - A: Once a battery is depleted, it cannot be used again, but you can use another battery from the pack.

3. **Q: Is it allowed to start with a computer running on multiple batteries arranged in sequence?**
   - A: No, each computer starts with only one battery and you can only replace batteries when they are depleted.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum amount of time `T` such that all `n` computers can run simultaneously for `T` minutes with the given batteries.

We can approach this problem using binary search to efficiently find the largest feasible running time.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate Initial Bounds for Binary Search:**
   - The lower bound (`left`) is `0` because the minimum time could be `0` minutes.
   - The upper bound (`right`) is the sum of all battery capacities divided by the number of computers (`n`), i.e., `sum(batteries) // n`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - We perform a binary search within the calculated bounds to determine the maximum running time `T`.
   - For a given midpoint (`mid`), we check if it is possible to run all `n` computers simultaneously for `mid` minutes.

3. **Validity Check for Each `T` Value:**
   - Sort the batteries in descending order and use the highest capacity batteries first.
   - Aggregate battery capacities and check if they can support the `n` computers running for `mid` minutes.

4. **Adjust Search Range:**
   - If running for `mid` minutes is possible, search the higher half (i.e., `left = mid + 1`).
   - If not, search the lower half (i.e., `right = mid - 1`).

## Code

```javascript
function maxRunTime(n, batteries) {
    let totalSum = batteries.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    let left = 0, right = Math.floor(totalSum / n);

    const canRunFor = (T) => {
        let timeNeeded = T * n;
        let currentPower = 0;

        for (let battery of batteries) {
            currentPower += Math.min(battery, T);
            if (currentPower >= timeNeeded) return true;
        }

        return currentPower >= timeNeeded;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right + 1) / 2);
        if (canRunFor(mid)) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the batteries:** `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of batteries.
- **Binary Search:** `O(log(sum(batteries)))`, which involves checking feasibility with a linear pass `O(m)` each time.
  
Thus, the total time complexity is `O(m log m + m log(sum(batteries)))`.

This efficient approach ensures that we can handle large inputs effectively.
