[Leetcode 2248. Intersection of Multiple Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2248)
## Problem Statement
Given a 2D array `nums` where `nums[i]` is a list of integers and represents a set of elements, return a list of all integers that appear in each set in `nums` sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [[3,1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,4],[3,4,5,6]]
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation: 
The only integers that are present in each of the lists are 3 and 4, hence the output is [3, 4].
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i][j] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all the integers in each subset unique, or could there be duplicates within a set?
   - Presumption: All integers in each subset are unique according to the problem statement's typical interpretation.
2. Is the output list required to be in any specific order?
   - Yes, the output list needs to be sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Assumptions:**
   - Each subset contains unique integers.
   - Every set is represented as an array.
   - The final output must be the sorted list of integers that appear in **all** subsets.

2. **Steps to Solve:**
   - Use an intersection approach, where we first take the set of the elements from the first list.
   - For each subsequent list, perform the intersection operation with the current result.
   - Continue this process until all lists in `nums` have been processed.
   - Convert the resultant set into a sorted array.

3. **Detailed Plan:**
   - Initialize a set with elements from the first array in `nums`.
   - Iterate through each subsequent array in `nums`:
     - Update the set to be the intersection of itself and the next array.
   - Convert the final set to a list and sort it in ascending order.
   - Return this sorted list.

## Code
```javascript
function intersection(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return [];
    
    // Initialize the intersection set with the first list
    let result = new Set(nums[0]);
    
    // Perform the intersection operation for each subsequent list
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        result = new Set(nums[i].filter(num => result.has(num)));
    }
    
    // Convert the set to an array and sort it
    return Array.from(result).sort((a, b) => a - b);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(intersection([[3,1,2,4,5], [1,2,3,4], [3,4,5,6]])); // Output: [3, 4]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:**
  - Creating the Set from `nums[0]` has a time complexity of O(N) where N is the length of the first array.
- **Intersection Calculation:**
  - For each array in `nums`, the filtering and set creation have a time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the current array.
  - Across K lists, the operation is O(K * N).
- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the final array has a time complexity of O(M log M), where M is the number of elements in the final intersection set.

Thus, the overall time complexity will typically be O(K * N + M log M).
