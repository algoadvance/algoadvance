[Leetcode 2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2294)
## Problem Statement

- We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`.
- Our task is to partition the array into several subarrays such that the maximum difference between any two elements in the subarray is at most `k`.
- We need to determine the minimum number of subarrays needed to achieve this condition.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**:
   - What are the limits on the size of the array `nums`? 
   - What are the limits on the values within `nums` and the value of `k`?
   - Are there any guarantees about the order of elements within `nums`?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Do the subarrays need to be contiguous in the original array?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should we return if `nums` is empty?
   - What if `k` is 0?
   
## Strategy
To solve this problem, a logical approach would be:

1. **Sort the Array**: This will help in grouping numbers together so that the difference between adjacent numbers is minimized.
2. **Greedy Segmentation**: We can initialize a count of subarrays and start iterating through the sorted array. For each number, check if it can be included in the current subarray such that the condition `max - min <= k` is met. If it can’t, increment the subarray count and start a new subarray.

## Code
Here’s the implementation outline in JavaScript:

```javascript
function partitionArray(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    
    // Sort the array first
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let count = 1;
    let minElement = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] - minElement > k) {
            // Start a new subarray
            count++;
            minElement = nums[i];
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Sort the Array**: `nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);` sorts the elements in ascending order.
2. **Initialize Counter and Minimum Element**: 
   - `let count = 1;` because we need at least one subarray.
   - `let minElement = nums[0];` starts with the first element.
3. **Iterate and Check Difference**:
   - For each element in the array from the second element onwards, check if the difference between the current element and the `minElement` exceeds `k`.
   - If it does, increment the `count` indicating the start of a new subarray and update `minElement` to the current element.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time.
- The subsequent iteration over the array is `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum number of subarrays needed by sorting and then performing a linear scan.
