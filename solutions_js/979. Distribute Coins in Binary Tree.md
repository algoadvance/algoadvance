[Leetcode 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l979)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `N` nodes, where each node in the tree has `node.val` coins. There are `N` coins in total throughout the whole tree. In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to the other. (A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.) Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

**Example:**

```
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is `N` (1 <= N <= 100).
- `0 <= Node.val <= N`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the tree be empty?
   - No, the tree has at least one node (as per constraint `N >= 1`).
   
2. Can the coin values be negative?
   - No, the coin value is always within the range `0 <= Node.val <= N`.

## Strategy:

1. Perform a postorder traversal to calculate the excess coins in each subtree:
   - For each node, determine how many excess coins it has or needs by the formula:
     \[
     \text{excess} = \text{node.val} + \text{left excess} + \text{right excess} - 1
     \]
   - The `-1` here represents the fact that each node needs exactly one coin for itself.
   - Accumulate the absolute value of the excess coins needed or to be given away to contribute to the total number of moves.

2. Return the accumulated value of moves required to balance the coins across the tree.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var distributeCoins = function(root) {
    let moves = 0;

    function postOrder(node) {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        const leftExcess = postOrder(node.left);
        const rightExcess = postOrder(node.right);
        
        const excess = node.val + leftExcess + rightExcess - 1;
        
        moves += Math.abs(excess);
        
        return excess;
    }
    
    postOrder(root);
    return moves;
};
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) — since we perform postorder traversal of the tree, visiting each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) — where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree like a linked list), it could be O(N). However, in a balanced tree, it is O(log N).

By following this strategy and code, we can efficiently determine the minimum number of moves required to distribute coins such that every node has exactly one coin.
