[Leetcode 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1638)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. Count the number of non-empty substrings in `s` that differ by exactly one character from some non-empty substring in `t`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `t`?**
   - \(1 \leq s.length, t.length \leq 100\)
   
2. **What characters do the strings `s` and `t` contain?**
   - The strings contain lowercase English letters.

3. **Is there any specific handling for edge cases like empty strings or strings of different lengths?**
   - No, the problem guarantees non-empty strings.

### Strategy

1. **Generate substrings:** We will generate all possible substrings of `s` and `t`.
2. **Count differing characters:** For each pair of substrings (one from `s` and one from `t`) of the same length, count the number of positions at which the characters differ.
3. **Check for exactly one difference:** If a pair of substrings has exactly one differing character, count this pair.

### Code

```javascript
function countSubstrings(s, t) {
    let count = 0;
    
    const countSubstringsWithOneDiff = (startS, startT, maxLen) => {
        let diff = 0;
        let length = 0;
        
        for (let k = 0; k < maxLen; k++) {
            if (s[startS + k] !== t[startT + k]) {
                diff++;
            }
            length++;
            
            if (diff > 1) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        
        return diff === 1 ? length : 0;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < t.length; j++) {
            let maxLength = Math.min(s.length - i, t.length - j);
            for (let k = 1; k <= maxLength; k++) {
                if (countSubstringsWithOneDiff(i, j, k)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countSubstrings('aba', 'baba')); // Output: 6
console.log(countSubstrings('ab', 'bb'));    // Output: 3
console.log(countSubstrings('a', 'a'));      // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Generating substrings:**
   - Loop through each starting position in `s` and `t`.
   - For each starting position, generate all substrings up to the maximum possible length.
   
2. **Checking differences:**
   - For each pair of substrings, verify the number of differing positions.

The nested loops result in a complexity of \(O(n^2 \cdot m^2)\), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. Each substring comparison runs in linear time with a maximum number of operations of \(O(nm)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O((n^2 \cdot m^2) + (nm \cdot min(n, m)))\), which simplifies to \(O(n^2 \cdot m^2)\) given the constraints.
