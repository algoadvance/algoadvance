[Leetcode 2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2389)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`. Your task is to find the length of the longest subsequence in `nums` such that the sum of elements in this subsequence is less than or equal to a given value in `queries`.

For each query, you need to return the maximum length of such a subsequence.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements in `nums` unique?**
   - No, elements in `nums` are not necessarily unique.
   
2. **What are the constraints on `n` and `m`?**
   - Typical constraints could be `1 <= n, m <= 1000` as a reasonable starting point for the algorithm, but the exact values should be verified from the problem statement.

3. **Can subsequences rearrange the elements?**
   - Yes, subsequences do not need to maintain the order of elements, so you can sort the `nums` if needed.

4. **Are negative numbers allowed in `nums`?**
   - Typically, for such problems, we assume non-negative numbers unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the `nums` array.**
   - Sorting helps to efficiently determine the longest subsequence whose sum of elements does not exceed the query value.
   
2. **Use a prefix sum array.**
   - Compute the prefix sums of the sorted `nums` array so that each prefix sum represents the sum of the smallest `i` elements of `nums`.

3. **For each query, find the maximum subsequence length.**
   - Use binary search (e.g., `upper_bound` equivalent in JavaScript) on the prefix sum array to quickly determine the longest subsequence for each query. 

### Code
Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} queries
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var answerQueries = function(nums, queries) {
    // Sort the nums array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Prefix sum array
    let prefixSums = Array(nums.length).fill(0);
    prefixSums[0] = nums[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }
    
    // Result array
    let result = [];
    
    // Process each query
    for (let query of queries) {
        // Binary search to find maximum length of subsequence
        let low = 0;
        let high = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (prefixSums[mid] <= query) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        // `low` is the number of elements we can include
        result.push(low);
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting `nums` array:** O(n log n)
2. **Constructing prefix sums:** O(n)
3. **Handling each query:** Each query involves a binary search over the prefix sums, which is O(log n). For `m` queries, it becomes O(m log n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n + m log n), which is efficient for reasonably large values of `n` and `m`.

### Explanation
1. **Sorting and prefix sums:**
   - Sorting the `nums` array allows us to build a cumulative sum array `prefixSums` where each entry `prefixSums[i]` is the sum of the smallest `i+1` elements.
   
2. **Binary search for each query:**
   - For each query value, use binary search on the `prefixSums` array to find the longest subsequence whose sum is less than or equal to the query value. The index found gives the number of elements that can be included in the subsequence.

By following the above approach, you can efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints.
