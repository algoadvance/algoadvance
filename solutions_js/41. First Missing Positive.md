[Leetcode 41. First Missing Positive](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l41)
## Problem Statement
Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant `O(1)` extra space.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the expected input range for `nums`? 
    - The array can include any integers, both negative and positive.
2. What should the function return if the array is empty?
    - Return 1, as it is the smallest positive integer.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
    - No specific constraints mentioned, but it should fit within typical memory limits for a modern computer.

## Strategy 
The main challenge of this problem is achieving `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Ignore non-positive numbers and numbers larger than `n`**:
    - Since the smallest missing positive integer must be between `1` and `n+1`, we can ignore numbers that are not within this range.
    
2. **Place each number in its "correct" index position:**
    - For the number `x` in the array, if `1 <= x <= n`, ideally `nums[x - 1]` should have the value `x`. We will attempt to place each number in its correct position through swapping.

3. **Identify the first position that does not have the correct number**:
    - After rearranging the numbers, the first index `i` where `nums[i] != i + 1` will be our answer `i + 1`.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var firstMissingPositive = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Ensure the number is in the right position
        while (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] !== nums[i]) {
            // Swap nums[i] with nums[nums[i] - 1]
            let temp = nums[i];
            nums[i] = nums[temp - 1];
            nums[temp - 1] = temp;
        }
    }

    // After rearranging, find the first index where nums[i] != i + 1
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] !== i + 1) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }

    // If all positions are correct, the missing number is n + 1
    return n + 1;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`. Each element will be placed in its correct position at most once, leading to linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The rearrangement is done in-place.
