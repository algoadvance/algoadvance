[Leetcode 2876. Count Visited Nodes in a Directed Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2876)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n-1`. The graph is defined by a list of edges where each edge is a pair of nodes `[u, v]` indicating a directed edge from node `u` to node `v`. You start at node `0` and traverse the nodes using the directions provided by the edges. 

The goal is to count how many unique nodes you can visit starting from node `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any cycles in the graph?**
    - Yes, there can be cycles in the graph.

2. **Can the graph be disconnected?**
    - The graph is directed, so it could be disconnected. However, we're only concerned with nodes reachable from the starting node `0`.

3. **What is the maximum number of nodes `n`?**
    - The problem statement does not specify this, but typically LeetCode problems handle graphs with hundreds to thousands of nodes.

4. **Can there be self-loops in the graph?**
    - Yes, nodes can have edges pointing to themselves.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS):

1. **Model the Graph:** First, represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Traversal:** Use either BFS or DFS to explore all reachable nodes starting from node `0`.
3. **Count Unique Nodes:** Maintain a set to keep track of all visited nodes to ensure they are unique.

We'll use BFS in the following solution for simplicity.

### Code

```javascript
function countVisitedNodes(n, edges) {
    // Create adjacency list for graph representation
    let graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
    }

    // BFS initialization
    let visited = new Set();
    let queue = [0];
    visited.add(0);

    // BFS to traverse the graph
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let node = queue.shift();

        for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                visited.add(neighbor);
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    return visited.size;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:** Creating the adjacency list takes \(O(E)\) time, where \(E\) is the number of edges.
2. **BFS Traversal:** The BFS traversal will visit each node at most once and look at each edge at most once, so it takes \(O(V + E)\) time, where \(V\) is the number of vertices (nodes) and \(E\) is the number of edges.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(V + E)\), which is efficient for typical graph problems.

### Space Complexity

1. **Adjacency List:** Storing the graph takes \(O(V + E)\) space.
2. **Visited Set:** Storing the visited nodes takes \(O(V)\) space.
3. **BFS Queue:** In the worst case, the queue can store \(O(V)\) nodes.

So the total space complexity is \(O(V + E)\).

This approach efficiently counts the unique nodes visited starting from node `0` in the directed graph.
