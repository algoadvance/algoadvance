[Leetcode 1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1877)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length `n`. You need to split `nums` into `n/2` pairs such that:

- Each element in `nums` is in exactly one pair.
- The maximum pair sum is minimized.

The pair sum of a pair (a, b) is `a + b`. Minimize the maximum pair sum of any pair.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constraints are given for the elements in `nums`?**
   - Elements in `nums` are integers and `nums.length` is even.
   
2. **Is there any constraint on the value of elements in `nums`?**
   - Typically, the problem will include constraints like `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5` but this often doesn't affect the strategy since the algorithm focuses on pairs and their sums.

3. **Are there any particular constraints on the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, `n` will be an even number, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Sort the array `nums`.
2. **Paring Strategy**: Pair the smallest and largest remaining numbers to minimize the maximum pair sum.
3. **Two-pointer technique**: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`left`) and one from the end (`right`) of the sorted array to form pairs.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript code implementing this strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimizeMaxPairSum = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let maxPairSum = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        maxPairSum = Math.max(maxPairSum, nums[left] + nums[right]);
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return maxPairSum;
};
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array in ascending order.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize `maxPairSum` to track the highest pair sum we encounter.
3. **Two-pointer traversal**: Use a `while` loop with `left` starting at `0` and `right` starting at `nums.length - 1`.
   - In each iteration, calculate the sum of the pairs `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`.
   - Update `maxPairSum` if the current pair sum is larger than the previously recorded maximum.
   - Move `left` pointer one step right and `right` pointer one step left.
4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `left` is no longer less than `right`, meaning all elements have been paired.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The array is sorted in `O(n log n)`.
- **Pairing**: Creating pairs and calculating sums is done in `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.
