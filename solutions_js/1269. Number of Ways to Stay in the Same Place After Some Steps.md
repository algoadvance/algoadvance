### Problem Statement

**1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps**

You have a pointer at position 0 on an infinite number line. There are `n` steps to be taken, where each step covers a unit distance. The goal is to return to position 0 after completing all `n` steps. However, you can only move either to the left or right by 1 unit distance at each step.

Implement a function `numWays` that calculates the number of ways to be at position 0 after `n` steps. Since the answers can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Example 1:**
Input: `n = 3`
Output: `2`
Explanation: There are two ways to return to position 0 in 3 steps:
1. Step right, step left, step right.
2. Step left, step right, step left.

**Example 2:**
Input: `n = 2`
Output: `1`
Explanation: There is only one way to return to position 0 in 2 steps.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 500`

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the number of steps `n`?
   - `1 <= n <= 500`.
2. Is it guaranteed that `n` will always be a positive integer?
   - Yes.
3. Do we need to consider positions other than 0?
   - No, we are only concerned about staying at position 0.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to reach position `j` after `i` steps. Our target is `dp[n][0]`.

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to be at position `j` after `i` steps.
2. Base case: `dp[0][0] = 1`, since there is exactly one way to be at position 0 with 0 stepsâ€”do nothing.
3. Transition: To compute `dp[i][j]`, we can come from `dp[i-1][j-1]` (if we step right from `j-1` to `j`) or from `dp[i-1][j+1]` (if we step left from `j+1` to `j`).
4. Iterate over steps from 1 to `n` and for each step iterate over all possible positions to fill up the `dp` array.
5. The constraint "stay in the same place" after `n` steps means we're interested in `dp[n][0]`.

### Code

```javascript
function numWays(n) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            if (j - 1 >= 0) dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
            if (j + 1 <= n) dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return dp[n][0];
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) as there is a nested loop where both outer and inner loops run up to `n`.

The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) due to the 2D `dp` array.
