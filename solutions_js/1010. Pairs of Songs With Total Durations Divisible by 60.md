[Leetcode 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1010)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds. Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the number of elements in the `time` array?
     - *Typical constraints are mentioned in the problem description; let's assume 1 <= time.length <= 10^4 for simplicity and `1 <= time[i] <= 500`.*

2. **Examples and Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output for empty or single-element arrays?
     - If there are no elements or just one song, the result will be `0` since no pairs can be formed.

With these clarifications in mind, we can move to the strategy to solve the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Modulo Operation Insight:**
   - For two durations `a` and `b`, `(a + b) % 60 == 0` if `a % 60` and `b % 60` sum to `60` or `0`.

2. **Using a Hash Map:**
   - We need to count occurrences of each possible remainder when `time[i]` is divided by 60. These remainders range from `0` to `59`. 
   - Iterate over the list, for each song with duration `time[i]`:
     - Calculate the remainder when `time[i]` is divided by 60.
     - If the remainder is `0`, we need to pair it with other songs where remainder is also `0`.
     - For a non-zero remainder `r`, it should be paired with a song having remainder `60 - r`.

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Use a dictionary to store counts of remainders.
   - For each song's remainder, add the count of its complement (i.e., `60 - remainder`) to the result before updating the dictionary.

### Code

```javascript
function numPairsDivisibleBy60(time) {
    let count = 0;
    const remainders = new Array(60).fill(0);
    
    for (let t of time) {
        const remainder = t % 60;
        const complement = (remainder === 0) ? 0 : 60 - remainder;
        count += remainders[complement];
        remainders[remainder]++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const time = [30, 20, 150, 100, 40];
console.log(numPairsDivisibleBy60(time)); // Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `time`. We iterate over the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the size of the `remainders` array is constant (60 elements).

This ensures that the solution is efficient and suitable for large input sizes up to 10,000 elements.
