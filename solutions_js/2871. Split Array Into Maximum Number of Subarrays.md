[Leetcode 2871. Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2871)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums`. We define a subarray of `nums` as a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements of `nums`. A subarray `nums[i:j]` is a partition of `nums` if and only if:

- The concatenation of the subarrays in the partition yields the original array.
- Each subarray has the maximum possible sum encountered while traversing the array.

Your goal is to determine the maximum number of subarrays into which you can split the array `nums` such that the sum of each subarray is as large as possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   Typically, the size should be considered within practical limits, e.g., up to 10^5 elements for reasonable performance.

2. **Can the array `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   Yes, `nums` might contain negative numbers which can affect the subarray sums.

3. **Can we assume that we always find at least one valid way to split the array into subarrays?**
   Yes, even if the entire array itself is considered a single subarray.

4. **What should be returned?**
   Return the maximum number of subarrays that satisfy the condition.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Maximum Sum:**
   - First, we need to determine the maximum sum for any subarray (prefix sum). This can be done by using the Kadane's algorithm.

2. **Split Based on Maximum Sum:**
   - Then, traverse the array and try to find subarray splits where the sum equals the maximum sum from step 1.

3. **Count the Splits:**
   - Count how many such subarray splits we can make.

### Code

```javascript
function maxNumOfSubarrays(nums) {
    // Step 1: Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's Algorithm
    let maxSum = -Infinity;
    let currentSum = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        currentSum = Math.max(num, currentSum + num);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Traverse the array to count the number of subarrays with sum maxSum
    let count = 0;
    currentSum = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        currentSum += num;
        if (currentSum == maxSum) {
            count++;
            currentSum = 0; // Reset for next subarray
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
// let nums = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5, 8, -1, 2];
// console.log(maxNumOfSubarrays(nums)); // Output depends on input array
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because:
1. Finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm takes `O(n)`.
2. Traversing the array to count the number of such maximum sum subarrays also takes `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear, `O(n)`.
