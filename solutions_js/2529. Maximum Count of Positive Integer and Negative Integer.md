[Leetcode 2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2529)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an array `nums` consisting of non-zero integers. Your task is to find the maximum count of positive integers and negative integers in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   - Can the array be very large (edge cases)?
   - Are the integers in `nums` only positive and negative or do we need to handle zeros?
   
2. **Expected Output:**
   - Should the output be the maximum count of either positive integers or negative integers?
   
3. **Is extra space allowed for storing counts?**

Assuming the array can be of any length but will fit in memory, and we have to determine the maximum count between positive and negative integers, the problem becomes straightforward.

## Strategy:
1. We will iterate through the array and keep two counters: `positiveCount` and `negativeCount`.
2. For each integer in `nums`, if it is positive, increment `positiveCount`; if it is negative, increment `negativeCount`.
3. Finally, return the maximum of `positiveCount` and `negativeCount`.

## Code:

```javascript
function maxCount(nums) {
  let positiveCount = 0;
  let negativeCount = 0;

  for (let num of nums) {
    if (num > 0) {
      positiveCount++;
    } else if (num < 0) {
      negativeCount++;
    }
  }

  return Math.max(positiveCount, negativeCount);
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We are iterating through the array once to count the positive and negative numbers, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity: O(1)**: We are using a constant amount of extra space for storing the counts.

This solution should handle the problem effectively for typical input sizes.
