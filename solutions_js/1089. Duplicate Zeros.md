[Leetcode 1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1089)
### Problem Statement
Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right. Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Modify the input array in place and do this with O(1) extra space.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 9

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider any specific array values other than integers between 0 and 9?
   - No, the values will always be between 0 and 9.
2. Do we need to return the modified array or just modify it in place?
   - You should modify the array in place.

### Strategy
1. **Count the Zeros**: First, count the zeros to determine how many zeros will be duplicated.
2. **Shift Elements**: Start from the end of the array and work backwards to shift the elements and duplicate zeros where necessary.
3. **Handle Overflow**: Elements that are shifted beyond the boundary of the array are discarded, and we do not need to worry about them.

By traversing the array from the end, we can effectively handle the in-place modification without needing extra space for temporary storage.

### Code
```javascript
function duplicateZeros(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let zeros = 0;
    
    // Count the number of zeros
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === 0) {
            zeros++;
        }
    }
    
    // We will use two pointers approach starting from the end
    let i = n - 1;
    let j = n + zeros - 1;
    
    // Adjusting elements from the back to the front
    while (i < j) {
        if (j < n) {
            arr[j] = arr[i];
        }
        
        if (arr[i] === 0) {
            j--;
            if (j < n) {
                arr[j] = 0;  // Duplicate zero
            }
        }
        
        i--;
        j--;
    }
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0];
duplicateZeros(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array to count zeros and then traverse it again to shift elements.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in place without using any extra storage apart from a few variables.
