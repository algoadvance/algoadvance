[Leetcode 1930. Unique Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1930)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Find the number of unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 in the given string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
     - The length of the string `s` will be between 1 and 1000.

2. **Character Specifics:**
   - Are there only lowercase English letters in the input string?
     - Yes, the input string consists of only lowercase English letters.

3. **Definition Clarification:**
   - What constitutes a unique palindromic subsequence of length 3?
     - A palindromic subsequence of length 3 is of the form `aba`, where `a` and `b` are lowercase English letters and `a != b`.

### Strategy:
1. Iterate through each letter from 'a' to 'z'.
2. For each letter, find the first and last occurrence positions in the string.
3. For a valid palindromic subsequence of length 3, ensure there is at least one character between these first and last occurrences.
4. Collect all unique characters that fall between these positions to form the middle character of the palindrome.
5. Use a set to store and count unique palindromic subsequences.

### Code:

```javascript
var countPalindromicSubsequence = function(s) {
    let uniquePalindromes = new Set();

    // Iterate through each letter from 'a' to 'z'
    for (let charCode = 97; charCode <= 122; charCode++) {
        let char = String.fromCharCode(charCode);
        let firstIndex = s.indexOf(char);
        let lastIndex = s.lastIndexOf(char);

        // Check if there is space for at least one character between first and last occurrence
        if (firstIndex < lastIndex) {
            // Collect unique characters in between as the middle character
            let middleCharacters = new Set(s.slice(firstIndex + 1, lastIndex));
            for (let middleChar of middleCharacters) {
                uniquePalindromes.add(char + middleChar + char);
            }
        }
    }

    return uniquePalindromes.size;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(26 * n)**: The outer loop runs 26 times (once for each letter from 'a' to 'z'). Within each iteration:
  - Finding first and last index takes O(n) each.
  - Extracting the substring and inserting characters into a set also takes at most O(n).
  
Given that this simplifies to O(26 * n), we can generalize this to O(n), as 26 is a constant factor.

### Explanation:
1. **Unique Characters in Range:** We gather unique characters between the first and last occurrence of each character.
2. **Set Usage:** Using a set ensures that only unique palindromic subsequences are counted.
3. **String Slicing:** Efficiently slices parts of the string to find middle characters for potential palindromic subsequence formation.

This approach efficiently ensures that we capture all valid and unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 in the input string.
