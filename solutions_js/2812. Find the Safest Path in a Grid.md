[Leetcode 2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2812)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid representing a maze, where each cell in the grid is either `0` (an empty cell) or `1` (a blocked cell). You start at the top-left corner (cell `(0, 0)`) and need to reach the bottom-right corner (cell `(m-1, n-1)`). The goal is to find the safest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

The safeness of a path is the maximum number of `1`s in any row or column of the path. We want to find the safe path which has the minimum safeness.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can you move only right and down, or are diagonal and other moves (left, up) allowed?**
   - Typically, grid pathfinding problems allow moves right or down unless specified otherwise.

2. **Is it guaranteed that there's always a path from the start to the end?**
   - Let's assume there could be cases where no path exists, so we need to handle that scenario.
  
3. **Should we return only the minimal safeness value, or the actual path as well?**
   - We need to return the minimal safeness value.

With these assumptions, let's move on to the coding part.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
function findSafestPath(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    if (grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[m-1][n-1] == 1) return -1;

    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0]];

    const safeness = Array.from(Array(m), () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    safeness[0][0] = grid[0][0] === 1 ? 1 : 0;

    const queue = [[0, 0]];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [x, y] = queue.shift();

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n) {
                let maxSafety = Math.max(safeness[x][y], grid[nx][ny]);
                if (maxSafety < safeness[nx][ny]) {
                    safeness[nx][ny] = maxSafety;
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return safeness[m-1][n-1] === Infinity ? -1 : safeness[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Create a `safeness` 2D array to track the maximum number of `1`s in any row or column up to each cell.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a queue to implement BFS for pathfinding, as BFS ensures that we evaluate nodes level by level, which is appropriate for finding shortest or optimal paths.

3. **Update Safeness**: For each cell, calculate the safeness based on the maximum safeness of the previous cell and the current cell's value. If the new safeness value is less than the previously recorded safeness, update it and add the position to the queue.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: If the start or end cell is blocked, return `-1` immediately. If no path is found, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns:
- Each cell is processed at most once by the BFS.
- Directions are limited to two (right and down), keeping the operations linear with respect to grid size.

This solution efficiently finds the safest path in the given grid with minimal safeness value.
