[Leetcode 541. Reverse String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l541)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to reverse every `2k` characters of the string. Specifically:
- Reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.
- If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them.
- If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Type**: What are the constraints on the input values for the string `s` and integer `k`?
   - `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
   - `1 <= k <= 10^4`
2. **Characters Included**: Does `s` contain only lower-case English letters?
   - Yes, `s` consists of lower-case English letters only.
3. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to consider any special edge cases?
   - Yes, handling cases where the string length is less than `k` or between `k` and `2k`.

### Strategy
1. **Traverse the String**: Iterate over the string in increments of `2k`.
2. **Reverse Segments**: For each segment of `2k` characters:
    - Reverse the first `k` characters.
    - Keep the next `k` characters as they are.
3. **Handle Remainder**: If characters left are fewer than `k` or between `k` and `2k`, implement the specific reversion rules mentioned.

### Code
```javascript
function reverseStr(s, k) {
    let n = s.length;
    let arr = s.split('');  // Convert the string to an array for easier manipulation
    
    for (let start = 0; start < n; start += 2 * k) { 
        let i = start;
        let j = Math.min(start + k - 1, n - 1); // Find the end index for the k characters to reverse

        // Reverse the first k characters in the current segment
        while (i < j) {
            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]]; // Swap characters
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
    
    return arr.join(''); // Convert the array back to a string
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed a limited number of times during the segment reversals.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in space due to the array representation of the string, but this can be considered as O(1) extra space beyond the input and output data if translating to in-place modifications.

This approach ensures that the function handles various edge cases and operates efficiently within the given constraints.
