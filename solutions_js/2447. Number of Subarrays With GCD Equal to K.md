[Leetcode 2447. Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2447)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a sequence of numbers is the largest positive integer that divides all the numbers in the sequence.

Return the number of subarrays of `nums` where the GCD of the subarray's elements is equal to `k`.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [9, 3, 1, 2, 6, 3], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays have gcd equal to 3 are:
   - [9, 3]
   - [3]
   - [3, 1, 2, 6, 3]
   - [6, 3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   A: The problem statement implies that we are dealing with positive numbers, typically GCD is discussed in the context of non-negative integers.

2. **Q: What is the size limit for `nums`?**
   A: Given this is a coding problem that is often constrained by practical execution limits on platforms like LeetCode, we can assume up to 10^5 elements in `nums`.

3. **Q: If all elements in `nums` are less than `k`, should we return 0?**
   A: Yes, if no subarray can have a GCD of `k`, the result should be 0.

4. **Q: Are single element subarrays valid?**
   A: Yes, single element subarrays are valid and should be considered in the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate over all subarrays**: We need to check all possible subarrays and compute the GCD.
2. **Check GCD**: For each subarray, calculate the GCD and compare it with `k`.
3. **Count matching subarrays**: Keep a count of how many subarrays match the GCD `k`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var subarrayGCD = function(nums, k) {
    const gcd = (a, b) => (b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b));
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let currentGcd = 0;
        for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            currentGcd = gcd(currentGcd, nums[j]);
            if (currentGcd === k) {
                count++;
            } else if (currentGcd < k) {
                break; // No need to continue if GCD has fallen below k
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2 \log M)\), where:

- \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- \(\log M\) is the time complexity of the `gcd` calculation for numbers \(a\) and \(b\), where both \(a\) and \(b\) are at most the largest number in `nums`.

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough for an array of up to \(10^5\) elements.
