[Leetcode 2518. Number of Great Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2518)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k`. The task is to count the number of valid subsets `S` such that the sum of the elements in `S` is at most `k`, and the sum of the elements of the complementary subset (which includes all elements in `nums` but not in `S`) is also at most `k`.

A partition of the array into subsets `S` and `complement(S)` is valid if both `sum(S) <= k` and `sum(complement(S)) <= k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array `nums` contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` can contain duplicate elements.
2. **What should be returned if there are no valid partitions?**
   - The function should return `0` if there are no valid partitions.
3. **How large can `nums` be?**
   - For performance considerations, assume `nums` can be up to `10^5` in length, and `k` can be as large as `10^4`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to accomplish the following steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.
2. If the total sum exceeds `2 * k`, it's immediately clear that no valid partition exists.
3. Use dynamic programming to count subsets with sums up to `k`.

Using a dynamic programming (DP) array, we can determine the number of ways to create subsets with sums up to `k`.
   
For simplicity, the DP array `dp[i]` will represent the number of subsets with a sum of `i`.

**Steps to Implement:**

1. **Initialize the DP Table:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`, since there is one way to create a subset with a sum of 0 (the empty subset).
2. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - For each number in `nums`, update the DP table from right to left to avoid overwriting values prematurely.
   - Iterate through possible sums from `k` down to the current number.

3. **Count Valid Subsets:**
   - Sum up all entries in the DP table up to `k`.

4. **Calculate the Total Possible Subsets:**
   - This is `2^n` where `n` is the length of `nums`.

5. **Return the Difference:**
   - Valid partitions are those where both subset sums are <= k.
   - Subtract the number of invalid complementary partitions from the total possible subsets.

### Code

```javascript
function countPartitions(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    
    if (totalSum > 2 * k) return 0;

    const dp = Array(k + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // There is one way to make a sum of 0 (empty subset)

    for (let num of nums) {
        for (let j = k; j >= num; j--) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - num];
        }
    }

    // All subsets, including those where sum(S) > k
    let validSubsets = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
        validSubsets += dp[i];
    }

    // Total possible subsets: 2^n
    const totalSubsets = 1 << n;

    // Subtracting invalid partitions
    const result = totalSubsets - 2 * validSubsets + (dp[0] * 2);

    return result;
}
```
### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization of DP Table**: \(O(k)\)
2. **Filling the DP Table**: \(O(n \times k)\)
3. **Summing up Valid Subsets**: \(O(k)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \times k)\). This is efficient enough given the constraints.

The space complexity is \(O(k)\) for the DP table.
