[Leetcode 2358. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2358)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `grades` where each element represents the grade of a student in a class. Your task is to divide the students into the maximum number of groups such that each group has more students than the previous one. Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: grades = [10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5]
Output: 3

Input: grades = [8, 8]
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a student belong to more than one group?**
   - No, each student can belong to only one group.
2. **Is the order of students important?**
   - No, the order in which students are picked does not matter.
3. **Can any grade values be negative or non-integer?**
   - It is implied that the grades are non-negative integers.
4. **Is the input size constrained?**
   - The constraints are typical for the problem, usually it won't exceed what can be handled by common algorithms effectively.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Grades**: While we don't necessarily need sorted values for the general concept, sorting helps in visualizing the groups.
2. **Greedy Group Formation**: Start forming groups from `1` student and keep incrementing the group size until you cannot form more groups. This can be implemented using a loop or by leveraging arithmetic properties to determine the largest possible value of `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` (sum of an arithmetic series).

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxGroups(grades) {
    grades.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0;
    let totalStudents = grades.length;
    let currentGroupSize = 1;

    while (totalStudents >= currentGroupSize) {
        count++;
        totalStudents -= currentGroupSize;
        currentGroupSize++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Examples
console.log(maxGroups([10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5])); // Output: 3
console.log(maxGroups([8, 8])); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting operation takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Greedy Group Formation**: It runs in `O(k)` where `k` is the maximum number of groups, but practically this loop will run `O(sqrt(n))` times in derived form.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`, because this is the dominant term due to sorting.

This solution ensures we have the maximum possible number of groups while retaining valid group formation.
