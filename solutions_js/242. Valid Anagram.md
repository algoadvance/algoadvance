[Leetcode 242. Valid Anagram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l242)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, write a function to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the strings contain any characters other than lowercase alphabets?**
   - A: No, it is mentioned that strings only contain lowercase alphabets.
   
2. **Q: Can the strings be of different lengths?**
   - A: If the lengths of the strings differ, they cannot be anagrams, because anagrams must consist of the same characters in the same counts.

3. **Q: Should we consider whitespace or special cases such as empty strings?**
   - A: The problem implies we only deal with lowercase alphabets; empty strings would trivially be anagrams of each other.

## Strategy
To determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`, we can take the following approach:
1. **Count Character Frequencies**: Use a hash map (or array of size 26 for lowercase alphabets) to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. **Compare Frequencies**: If both hash maps (or arrays) have the same character frequencies for all characters, then `t` is an anagram of `s`.

## Code
Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    let count = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        count[s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        count[t.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]--;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count[i] !== 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Length Check**: We first check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, return false.
2. **Count Array**: Initialize a `count` array of size 26 (one for each character from 'a' to 'z') initialized to zero.
3. **Traverse Strings**: Traverse each character of strings `s` and `t`. For each character in `s`, increment the corresponding index in `count`. For each character in `t`, decrement the corresponding index in `count`.
4. **Check Count Array**: Finally, check the `count` array. If all values are zero, it means `s` and `t` have the same character counts, and `t` is an anagram of `s`. Otherwise, return false.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse through the strings once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the `count` array size is constant (26).

This solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided (strings with only lowercase alphabets).
