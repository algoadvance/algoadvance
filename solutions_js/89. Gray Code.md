[Leetcode 89. Gray Code](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l89)
### Problem Statement

The **Gray code** is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer `n` representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of Gray code. A Gray code sequence must begin with 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum and maximum value of `n`?**
   - The minimum value is 0, and the maximum value is subject to the limits of the programming environment but typically, let's say less than 20 for practical purposes.
   
2. **Should the output be in list or array format?**
   - Yes, the output should be an array of integers representing the Gray code sequence.

3. **Is there any specific requirement for the way to generate the Gray code?**
   - No specific method is required. The goal is to ensure that the Gray code sequence is generated correctly according to the definition.

### Strategy

To generate the Gray code sequence for `n` bits, the idea can be broken down as follows:

1. **Base Case**: The sequence for 0 bits is `[0]`.
2. **Recurrence Relation**: For more bits:
   - Reflect the current sequence.
   - Prefix the original sequence with `0` and the reflected sequence with `1`.
  
3. **Steps**:
   - Start with the initial sequence `[0]`.
   - For each subsequent bit level, generate the new sequence by reflecting current sequence and adding appropriate prefixes.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Generates the Gray code sequence for `n` bits.
 * @param {number} n - Total number of bits.
 * @return {number[]} - The sequence of Gray code.
 */
function grayCode(n) {
    let result = [0];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const currentLength = result.length;
        const mask = 1 << i;
        
        // Reflect and add mask
        for (let j = currentLength - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            result.push(result[j] | mask);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(grayCode(2)); // Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the number of bits. As for each bit level, the sequence length doubles and we perform operations for each current length.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(2^n)` for storing the result sequence.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with the base case sequence `[0]`.
2. **Iteration for each bit level**:
   - Calculate the mask (`1 << i`) for the current bit.
   - Reflect the current sequence and OR each reflected value with the mask to ensure new high bit is accounted.
   - Append these new values to the result.

Each loop essentially builds upon the sequence from the previous level ensuring that each adjacent number in the result differs by exactly one bit.
