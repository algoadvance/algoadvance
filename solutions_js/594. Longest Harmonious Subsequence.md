[Leetcode 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l594)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 594: Longest Harmonious Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**:
   - What are the constraints on the array `nums`? (Max length and values)
   - Can the input array be empty?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - What should be returned if no harmonious subsequence exists?

3. **Example**:
   - For instance, if `nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7]`, is the expected output `5` because the longest harmonious subsequence is `[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]`?

Assuming standard constraints:
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
   - `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
   - If no harmonious subsequence exists, we return `0`.

### Strategy
1. We need to count the occurrences of each number in the array using a hash map.
2. For each unique number in the hash map, check if the number `+1` exists in the hash map.
3. Calculate the length of the subsequence formed by the current number and the current number `+1`.
4. Keep track of the maximum length found.

### Code
```javascript
var findLHS = function(nums) {
    let hashMap = {};
    
    // Count the frequency of each number in the array
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (!hashMap[num]) {
            hashMap[num] = 0;
        }
        hashMap[num]++;
    }
    
    let longest = 0;
    
    // Check for harmonious subsequences
    for (let num in hashMap) {
        let currentNum = parseInt(num);
        if (hashMap[currentNum + 1] !== undefined) {
            longest = Math.max(longest, hashMap[currentNum] + hashMap[currentNum + 1]);
        }
    }
    
    return longest;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7];
console.log(findLHS(nums)); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array to populate the hash map and then iterate through the keys of the hash map.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of unique elements in the array. The hash map stores the frequency of each unique element.
