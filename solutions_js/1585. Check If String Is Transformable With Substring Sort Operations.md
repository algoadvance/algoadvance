[Leetcode 1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1585)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, consisting of digits from 0 to 9, you need to determine if you can transform string `s` into string `t` by performing a series of operations. In each operation, you can choose any substring of `s` and sort it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the input strings `s` and `t` always be the same length and consist of only digits (0-9)?**
   - Yes.

2. **Is it necessary to preserve the order of characters in the substring during sorting operations?**
   - Yes, sorting a substring rearranges the characters within that range in ascending order.

### Strategy
The problem involves checking if string `s` can be transformed into string `t` by sorting substrings. To effectively determine if the transformation is possible:
1. We'll compare the positions of each digit in both `s` and `t`.
2. For each digit, verify that all previous digits (considering order '0' to '9') in `s` can be rearranged to match their position in `t` without violating sorting constraints.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:
1. Maintain a list of indices for each digit (0 to 9) in `s`.
2. Traverse each character in `t` and check if it can be obtained considering the indices of all previous 'smaller' digits. This helps ensure that ordering constraints are not violated.

### Code
```javascript
function isTransformable(s, t) {
    // Initialize array of queues for digits 0-9
    let positions = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => []);
    let n = s.length;

    // Populate the positions array with indices of each digit in s
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        positions[s[i]].push(i);
    }

    // Process each character in t
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let digit = t[i];
        
        // If there's no occurrence of the required digit in s, return false
        if (!positions[digit].length) return false;

        // Get the position of the first occurrence of digit in s
        let pos = positions[digit][0];

        // Ensure no smaller digit appears before current digit in s
        for (let j = 0; j < digit; j++) {
            if (positions[j].length && positions[j][0] < pos) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Remove the used position
        positions[digit].shift();
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: O(n). Populating the positions array involves a single pass through string `s`.
- **Transformation Check**: O(n * 10). For each character in `t`, checking the constraints involves at worst checking 10 digits.

Overall, this results in a linear complexity relative to the length of the string: **O(n)**, ensuring efficient checks even for longer strings.

By using this strategy, we can confirm whether string `s` can be transformed into string `t` with the allowed substring sort operations.
