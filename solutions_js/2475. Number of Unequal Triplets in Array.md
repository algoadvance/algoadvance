[Leetcode 2475. Number of Unequal Triplets in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2475)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers `nums`. Find the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` that meet the following conditions:

- `0 <= i < j < k < nums.length`
- `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` are all pairwise distinct.

In other words, `(nums[i] != nums[j])`, `(nums[i] != nums[k])`, and `(nums[j] != nums[k])`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no such triplets are found?**
   - Return `0` if there are no triplets that meet the condition.
   
2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The array `nums` will have at least 3 elements, and typically, constraints for such problems might have `nums.length` up to 10^3 or more.

4. **Can the elements be very large/small?**
   - The elements are positive integers and are within a reasonable range (typically within 1 to 10^3).

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Use a triple nested loop to check every possible triplet.
   - Count the number of triplets that satisfy the condition `(nums[i] != nums[j])`, `(nums[i] != nums[k])`, and `(nums[j] != nums[k])`.

2. **Complexity Consideration:**
   - The brute force method will have a time complexity of O(n^3), which may be acceptable given the constraints.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you could implement the brute force solution:

```javascript
function countUnequalTriplets(nums) {
  let count = 0;
  const n = nums.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
      for (let k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
        if (nums[i] !== nums[j] && nums[i] !== nums[k] && nums[j] !== nums[k]) {
          count++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return count;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [4, 4, 2, 4, 3];
console.log(countUnequalTriplets(nums));  // Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n^3), where n is the length of the array. This is because we use three nested loops each running up to n.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are using only a fixed amount of additional space that does not grow with input size.

If the performance is a concern, especially for larger arrays, you might want to consider alternative approaches that could potentially optimize this, but given typical constraints of such problems, the above solution should generally be sufficient.
