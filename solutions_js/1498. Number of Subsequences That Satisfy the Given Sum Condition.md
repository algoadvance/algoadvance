[Leetcode 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1498)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
   - `1 <= target <= 10^6`

2. **Can elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - No, all elements in `nums` are positive integers as per the constraint `1 <= nums[i]`.

3. **What if the array `nums` contains duplicates?**
   - Duplicates are allowed in `nums`.

4. **Is there a constraint on the size of each subsequence?**
   - No, there's no constraint on the size of the subsequence, but subsequences should be non-empty.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: Sort the array `nums` to enable efficient two-pointer traversal.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning and `right` starting from the end of the sorted array.
3. **Conditions**:
   - If the sum of the elements at `left` and `right` is less than or equal to `target`, then all subsequences that start at `left` and end within the range `[left, right]` are valid. There are \(2^{(right - left)}\) such subsequences (excluding the empty one).
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right to consider other possibilities.
   - If the sum of the elements at `left` and `right` is greater than `target`, move the `right` pointer to the left.
4. **Modulus**: Ensure that the result is always taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Code

```javascript
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var numSubseq = function(nums, target) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let result = 0;
    
    // Precompute powers of 2 up to the length of the array
    let powers = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        powers[i] = (powers[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
    }
    
    while (left <= right) {
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] <= target) {
            result = (result + powers[right - left]) % MOD;
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Two-Pointer Traversal**: `O(N)`, in the worst case, every element will be processed once by the `left` and `right` pointers.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(N log N)` due to sorting being the dominant factor.

### Space Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(1)` additional space if we ignore the input space as itâ€™s done in-place (considering the sort algorithm used by JavaScript).
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(N)` for storing powers of 2.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: `O(N)` due to the auxiliary space.
