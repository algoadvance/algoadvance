## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1759 - Count Number of Homogenous Substrings

Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.
"aa"  appears 1 time.
"b"   appears 2 times.
"bb"  appears 1 time.
"c"   appears 3 times.
"cc"  appears 2 times.
"ccc" appears 1 time.
3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "xy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "zzzzz"
Output: 15
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the expected output if the input string is empty?
   **A:** The output should be `0` as there are no substrings in an empty string.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the input string length?
   **A:** The problem generally follows typical constraints for competitive programming. The length of the string `s` will be between `1` and `10^5`.

3. **Q:** How efficient does the solution need to be?
   **A:** The solution should be linear, i.e., O(n) in time complexity, to handle the upper limit of input size efficiently.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** We need to initialize a counter to traverse the string and a variable to store the total count of homogeneous substrings. We also need a modulus value `MOD = 10^9 + 7` to handle the output.

2. **Iterate and Count:** Iterate through the string and count the number of contiguous homogeneous substrings by maintaining a current character and its count. For every segment of contiguous same characters with length `k`, the number of homogenous substrings is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

3. **Handling Large Numbers:** Use modulus operation at each addition step to prevent overflow and ensure the result stays within integer limits.

4. **Edge Handling:** Check edge cases like single-character strings or strings where no two characters are the same.

## Code

```javascript
function countHomogenous(s) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    let count = 0;
    let currentChar = '';
    let currentCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === currentChar) {
            currentCount += 1;
        } else {
            currentChar = s[i];
            currentCount = 1;
        }
        count = (count + currentCount) % MOD;
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countHomogenous("abbcccaa")); // Output: 13
console.log(countHomogenous("xy"));       // Output: 2
console.log(countHomogenous("zzzzz"));    // Output: 15
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, because it involves a single pass through the string.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few variables to keep track of counts, and not using any additional data structures that grow with input size.
