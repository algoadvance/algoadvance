[Leetcode 15. 3Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l15)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array contain duplicates?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain duplicates.
   
2. **Q:** Do we need to handle special cases like arrays with fewer than three elements?
   **A:** Yes, if the array has fewer than three elements, we should return an empty list since no triplet can be formed.

3. **Q:** How should the output be formatted?
   **A:** The output should be a list of lists, with each inner list representing a valid triplet.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting the input array helps to efficiently skip duplicates and apply the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate and Apply Two-Pointer Technique:** Use a for-loop to iterate through the array. For each element, fix it as a potential first element of the triplet, then use the two-pointer technique to find the other two elements that sum to zero.
3. **Skip Duplicates:** Carefully skip duplicate elements to avoid returning duplicate triplets.
4. **Handle Edge Cases:** Return an empty list if the array has fewer than three elements.

### Code
```javascript
function threeSum(nums) {
    const result = [];
    if (nums.length < 3) return result;
    
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        // Skip the duplicate elements for the fixed element
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
        
        let left = i + 1;
        let right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum === 0) {
                result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
                // Move left and right pointers to skip duplicates
                while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
                while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (sum < 0) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(threeSum([-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]));  // Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input array.
- **Two-pointer Technique:** For each element in the array, the two-pointer process takes \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\). This is because the initial for-loop runs \(O(n)\) times, and for each iteration, the two-pointer technique operates in \(O(n)\).
