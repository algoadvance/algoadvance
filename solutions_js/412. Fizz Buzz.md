[Leetcode 412. Fizz Buzz](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l412)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by 3.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by 5.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input size?**
   - The input is a single integer `n`.
   - Are there any constraints on `n`? For example, is `n` always positive?

2. **Expected output?**
   - A list of strings meeting above conditions for each integer from 1 to `n`.

3. **Edge cases?**
   - How should the function behave if `n = 0`? (Likely input will be `n >= 1` based on typical use.)

### Strategy
- Initialize an empty array `answer`.
- Create a loop that runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For each number:
  - Check its divisibility by 3 and 5 to append corresponding "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".
  - If the number is not divisible by either, append the number itself converted to a string.
- Return the array `answer`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var fizzBuzz = function(n) {
    let answer = [];
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            answer.push("FizzBuzz");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            answer.push("Fizz");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            answer.push("Buzz");
        } else {
            answer.push(i.toString());
        }
    }
    
    return answer;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** since we need to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the storage required for the `answer` array for `n` elements.

This should cover common scenarios and produce the correct result for typical values of `n`.
