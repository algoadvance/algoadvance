[Leetcode 3025. Find the Number of Ways to Place People I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3025)
### Problem Statement

(This is a hypothetical LeetCode problem since 3025 currently does not exist, but I will assume the problem closely resembles a combinatorial or arrangement-based question.)

You are given a list of `N` unique people and an integer `K`. You need to determine the number of ways to place these `N` people such that there are exactly `K` people standing in a straight line. 

Return the number of ways to arrange these `N` people with exactly `K` people standing in a straight line.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `N` and `K`?**
   - Typically `1 <= K <= N <= 12` might be reasonable constraints for combinatorial problems.

2. **Are we considering permutations or combinations?**
   - Given "ways to place people," it sounds like permutations of `K` out of `N` people are required.

3. **What does 'standing in a straight line' imply?**
   - It implies we need to consider the order of people, i.e., permutations are considered.

Let's assume the inputs are within reasonable constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of ways to choose `K` people out of `N`. This is given by combinations formula `C(N, K)`.
2. Arrange these `K` chosen people in a straight line. This is given by permutations formula `K!`.

Therefore, the result is `C(N, K) * K!` which can also be written as `N! / (N-K)!`.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate factorials up to `N`.
2. Use the formula `N! / (N-K)!` to get the number of arrangements.

### Code

```javascript
// Helper function to calculate factorial
function factorial(n) {
    let result = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

function numberOfWaysToPlacePeople(N, K) {
    if (K > N) return 0; // if K is greater than N, it's not possible to arrange

    // Calculate N! (N factorial)
    let numFactorial = factorial(N);
    
    // Calculate (N-K)! [(N-K) factorial]
    let denomFactorial = factorial(N - K);
    
    // Number of ways to arrange K out of N people
    const result = numFactorial / denomFactorial; // This is N! / (N-K)!
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfWaysToPlacePeople(5, 3)); // Output: 60
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the factorial of a number `N` takes `O(N)` time.
- Thus, the time complexity of this solution is `O(N)` for calculating both factorials involved.

By precomputing factorials up to `N`, we ensure efficient computation, making the solution optimal for the input constraints.
