[Leetcode 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l671)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' values. If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Type:**
   - Can we assume the tree is not empty? 
     - **Yes, the problem states a non-empty tree.**
   - What is the value range of the node values?
     - **The node values are non-negative integers.**

2. **Output:**
   - If all node values are the same, we should return `-1`?
     - **Yes.**

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The root node of the tree is guaranteed to contain the smallest value (by problem statement constraints).
   - Our task is to find the second minimum value in the tree.

2. **Approach:**
   - Traverse the tree and collect node values.
   - Use a set to automatically handle unique values.
   - If the set size is less than 2, return -1 since thereâ€™s no second minimum value.
   - Sort the set (or keep track of the smallest and the second smallest values directly) and return the second smallest.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Perform DFS (Depth First Search) to traverse all nodes.
   - Maintain the smallest and second smallest values.
   - Return the second smallest if found, otherwise return -1.

### Code

```javascript
function findSecondMinimumValue(root) {
    if (!root) return -1;
    
    let firstMin = root.val;
    let secondMin = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let found = false;
    
    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return;
        
        // Update secondMin if we find a new second smallest value
        if (node.val > firstMin && node.val < secondMin) {
            secondMin = node.val;
            found = true;
        }
        
        // Continue DFS traversal
        dfs(node.left);
        dfs(node.right);
    }
    
    dfs(root);
    return found ? secondMin : -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We potentially visit each node once in the DFS traversal.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(h)
  - Where h is the height of the binary tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack in the worst case. In the case of a completely unbalanced tree, the space complexity is O(n).

In summary, this approach ensures we efficiently find the second minimum value in a special binary tree using a depth-first traversal with a space complexity that depends on the height of the tree.
