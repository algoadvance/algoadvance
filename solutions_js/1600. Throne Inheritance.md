[Leetcode 1600. Throne Inheritance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1600)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a class to manage a simplified version of a royal family's throne inheritance system.

The main operations you need to support are:
1. Birth: Indicate that a new child has been born.
2. Death: Indicate that someone has died.
3. GetInheritanceOrder: Provide the current inheritance order, excluding deceased individuals.

Each person is represented by a name (`string`). A king (with a known name) initially occupies the throne. The following rules determine the inheritance:
- The king's children, followed by their children in the order of birth, inherit the throne in a depth-first manner.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Initial Throne Holder**: Who is the initial king? (This will be provided as an argument during initialization.)
2. **Unique Names**: Can names be repeated?
3. **Immediate Response**: Should the operations consider changes (e.g., deaths) immediately for the next responses?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are there any expected edge cases like multiple deaths or births in quick succession, multiple queries for the inheritance order, etc.?

### Code

```javascript
class ThroneInheritance {
    constructor(kingName) {
        this.king = kingName;
        this.parentMap = new Map();
        this.deathSet = new Set();
        this.childrenMap = new Map();
        
        // Initialize with the king
        this.childrenMap.set(kingName, []);
        this.parentMap.set(kingName, null);
    }
    
    birth(parentName, childName) {
        if (!this.childrenMap.has(parentName)) {
            this.childrenMap.set(parentName, []);
        }
        this.childrenMap.get(parentName).push(childName);
        this.childrenMap.set(childName, []);
        this.parentMap.set(childName, parentName);
    }
    
    death(name) {
        this.deathSet.add(name);
    }
    
    getInheritanceOrder() {
        let order = [];
        
        const dfs = (current) => {
            if (!this.deathSet.has(current)) {
                order.push(current);
            }
            if (this.childrenMap.has(current)) {
                for (let child of this.childrenMap.get(current)) {
                    dfs(child);
                }
            }
        };
        
        dfs(this.king);
        return order;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a map to keep track of parent-child relationships (`parentMap`).
    - Create a map to track children of each individual (`childrenMap`).
    - Maintain a set to track dead individuals (`deathSet`).

2. **Birth**:
    - When a child is born, add the child to the parent's children list in the `childrenMap`.
    - Add the child to `parentMap` with reference to its parent.

3. **Death**:
    - Add the individual to the `deathSet`.

4. **Get Inheritance Order**:
    - Perform a depth-first search starting from the king.
    - Skip any individuals present in the `deathSet`.
    - Recursively add children to the order list.

### Time Complexity

- **Birth Operation**: O(1) for map operations.
- **Death Operation**: O(1) for set operations.
- **Get Inheritance Order**:
    - Worst-case time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of individuals in the system. This is due to the depth-first traversal of all individuals to construct the inheritance order.

This implementation assumes that the depth-first traversal and handling of data structures like maps and sets are efficient for practical input sizes.
