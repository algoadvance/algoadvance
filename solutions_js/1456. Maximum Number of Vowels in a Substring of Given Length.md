[Leetcode 1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1456)
## Problem Statement

You're given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to calculate the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of length `k` within the string `s`.

Vowels in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

You need to write a function `maxVowels(s, k)` that returns this maximum number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if `k` is greater than the length of the string `s`?**
   - We assume that `1 <= k <= s.length`.

2. **What characters make up the input string?**
   - The string `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.

3. **Do we need to consider only contiguous substrings?**
   - Yes, the substrings considered for calculations are contiguous.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window approach to maintain a count of vowels in the current window of size `k`.
   - Initialize a window by counting the number of vowels in the first `k` characters.
   - Slide the window one character at a time towards the right. Remove the effect of the exiting character from the left and add the effect of the new entering character from the right.
   - Track the maximum count of vowels encountered during any of these windows.
   
2. **Edge cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to the length of `s`, then the result should be the number of vowels in the entire string.

## Code

```javascript
function isVowel(char) {
    return 'aeiou'.includes(char);
}

function maxVowels(s, k) {
    let maxCount = 0, currentCount = 0;

    // Initial count for the first window of size k
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (isVowel(s[i])) {
            currentCount++;
        }
    }
    
    maxCount = currentCount;

    // Slide the window one character at a time
    for (let i = k; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (isVowel(s[i - k])) {
            currentCount--;
        }
        if (isVowel(s[i])) {
            currentCount++;
        }
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);
    }

    return maxCount;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization and first window calculation**: `O(k)`
- **Sliding window across the string**: `O(n - k)`
  - Where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

Total time complexity is `O(n)`.

This solution effectively processes each character only a constant number of times, making it efficient for the problem constraints.
