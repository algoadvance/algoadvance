[Leetcode 2916. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2916)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subarray `sub[]` is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within the array. The sum of squares of a subarray is equal to the sum of the squares of each element in the subarray.

Return the sum of squares in all subarrays where each element in the subarray is distinct.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 14

The distinct subarrays and their sum of squares are:
- [1] -> 1^2 = 1
- [2] -> 2^2 = 4
- [3] -> 3^2 = 9
- [1, 2] -> 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
- [2, 3] -> 2^2 + 3^2 = 13

Total sum of all these is 1 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 13 = 32
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the numbers in the array guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   - No specific restrictions on array values are mentioned, but we assume they are valid integers according to problem constraints if any.

2. **Is the input size limited within certain bounds?**
   - Constraints usually given but assuming typical competitive programming constraints apply, we opt for an efficient solution.

## Strategy

1. Use a sliding window approach with two pointers to maintain the window of distinct elements.
2. Use a set to keep track of distinct elements in the current window.
3. For each subarray where all elements are distinct, calculate the sum of squares and add it to the total sum.
4. Ensure efficient operations to handle larger input sizes normally expected in such problems.

```javascript
function sumOfSquaresOfDistinctSubarrays(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;

    let totalSum = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let set = new Set();
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        while (set.has(nums[right])) {
            set.delete(nums[left]);
            left++;
        }
        set.add(nums[right]);

        // sum up the squares of current subarray nums[left:right+1]
        let subarraySum = 0;
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            subarraySum += nums[i] * nums[i];
        }
        totalSum += subarraySum;
    }
    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage
console.log(sumOfSquaresOfDistinctSubarrays([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 32
console.log(sumOfSquaresOfDistinctSubarrays([1, 2, 3, 2])); // Example with repetition
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is mainly driven by two pointer operation and set insert/remove operations:

1. Each element is inserted and removed from the set at most once which makes the overhead O(n).
2. Inner computation for sum of squares over a window leads to a time complexity of O(n^2) in worst cases involving complete recomputation in nested subarrays.

Thus overall worst-case complexity approximates to **O(n^2)**.

Feel free to adjust the implementation and conduct performance benchmarking on variations of input sets to tailor the solution for specific problem constraints.
