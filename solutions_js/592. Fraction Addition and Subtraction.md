[Leetcode 592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l592)
### Problem Statement
Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the result of this calculation in a simplified fraction. The result should be an irreducible fraction with positive numerator and denominator. If the fraction is positive, it should start with no "+" sign and if the fraction is negative, the denominator should always be positive. The input string only contains fractions separated by `'+'` or `'-'`.

**Example:**
```
Input: "-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"

Input: "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"

Input: "1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the input expression always be valid?
   - **Assumption**: Yes.
2. Can we assume that the denominators are not zero?
   - **Assumption**: Yes.
3. Are there any constraints on the range of the integers in the numerators and denominators?
   - **Assumption**: They will fit within the typical range for JavaScript integers.

### Strategy
1. **Parsing the Input:**
   - Break the input string into individual fraction components, taking into account both addition and subtraction operations.
2. **Common Denominator Method:**
   - Use a common denominator to handle the addition and subtraction of the fractions easily.
   - Keep track of the numerators collectively to simplify the final fraction.
3. **Simplification:**
   - Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) to simplify the resulting fraction.
4. **Handling Signs:**
   - Ensure the output format follows the positive numerator and denominator convention if the fraction is positive, and negative if the overall fraction is negative.

### Code
```javascript
function fractionAddition(expression) {
    // Function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor
    const gcd = (a, b) => b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    
    // Function to compute Least Common Multiple using GCD
    const lcm = (a, b) => (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    
    // Parsing the input expression into individual fractions
    let fractions = expression.match(/[+-]?\d+\/\d+/g);
    
    // Initialize numerator and denominator
    let numer = 0, denom = 1;
    
    // Adding/Subtracting fractions
    for (let fraction of fractions) {
        // Split the fraction into numerator and denominator
        let [num, den] = fraction.split('/').map(Number);
        
        // Find the Least Common Multiple of the current denominator and the new fraction's denominator
        let commonDenom = lcm(denom, den);
        
        // Adjust the numerators to the common denominator
        numer = numer * (commonDenom / denom) + num * (commonDenom / den);
        denom = commonDenom;
    }
    
    // Simplify the resultant fraction by dividing with the GCD
    let commonDivisor = gcd(Math.abs(numer), denom);
    numer /= commonDivisor;
    denom /= commonDivisor;
    
    // Ensure denominator is positive
    if (denom < 0) {
        numer = -numer;
        denom = -denom;
    }
    
    return `${numer}/${denom}`;
}

// Test cases
console.log(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2")); // Output: "0/1"
console.log(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2+1/3")); // Output: "1/3"
console.log(fractionAddition("1/3-1/2")); // Output: "-1/6"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Parsing the fractions** takes O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
- Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction) involves finding the LCM and GCD which takes O(log(min(a,b))).
- Overall complexity is dominated by the fraction operations, and thus it is O(n * log(min(a, b))), where `a` and `b` are the fractions' numerators and denominators.
