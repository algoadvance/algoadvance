[Leetcode 1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1525)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, we want to split it into two non-empty substrings `left` and `right` such that the number of distinct characters in `left` is equal to the number of distinct characters in `right`. Return the number of ways to split the string.

**Example:**
```
Input: "aacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: "aa|caba" and "aaca|ba" are the two good splits.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the length of string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and 10^5.

2. **Can the string `s` contain any special characters or only alphabets?**
   - It is safe to assume `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Do we need to consider any case sensitivity?**
   - No, since the string contains only lowercase letters.

4. **What should be the return value if no valid splits are found?**
   - Return 0 if no valid splits are possible.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two arrays: `leftDistinct` and `rightDistinct` each of size `n` (length of `s`). These will help us keep track of the count of distinct characters from the beginning till index `i` and from the end till index `i` respectively.
   
2. **Traverse the string:**
   - Traverse `s` from left to right to populate `leftDistinct`.
   - Traverse `s` from right to left to populate `rightDistinct`.
   
3. **Count Valid Splits:**
   - Iterate through the possible split points (from 1 to n-1) and count the number of positions where `leftDistinct[i] == rightDistinct[i + 1]`.

## Code
```javascript
var numSplits = function(s) {
    const leftCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const rightCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const leftDistinct = [];
    const rightDistinct = [];
    let distinctLeft = 0;
    let distinctRight = 0;

    // Populate the rightCount array first
    for (let char of s) {
        rightCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (leftCount[s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] === 0) {
            distinctLeft++;
        }
        leftCount[s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        leftDistinct[i] = distinctLeft;

        if (rightCount[s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] === 1) {
            distinctRight++;
        }
        rightCount[s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]--;

        rightDistinct[i] = distinctRight;
    }

    let result = 0;
    // Loop from first possible split to second last (n-1)
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
        if (leftDistinct[i] === rightDistinct[i + 1]) {
            result++;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Test Example
console.log(numSplits("aacaba")); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Preprocessing (counting characters):** O(n) - We traverse the string twice, once for initializing `rightCount` and once for filling `leftDistinct` and `rightDistinct`.
2. **Counting valid splits:** O(n) - We iterate over the possible splits.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the arrays used to keep track of distinct counts.
