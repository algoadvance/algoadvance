[Leetcode 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l714)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Your goal is to maximize your profit by choosing a day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock, repeatedly. The transaction fee is only charged once for each transaction (i.e. for each buy and sell pair).

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

**Example:**
```
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
    - Buying on day 1 (price = 1) and selling on day 4 (price = 8), profit = 8 - 1 - 2 = 5.
    - Buying on day 5 (price = 4) and selling on day 6 (price = 9), profit = 9 - 4 - 2 = 3.
    Total profit is 5 + 3 = 8.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the length of prices is at least 2?**
   Yes, the problem guarantees there is at least one buy and one sell.

2. **Is there a limit to the values of the prices array or the fee?**
   Generally, we can assume all values are within a reasonable range of positive integers.

### Strategy

We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The main idea is to keep track of two states:
- `cash`: The maximum profit if we do not own a stock.
- `hold`: The maximum profit if we own a stock.

We can update these values as follows:
1. If we do not own a stock, our profit could either remain the same as the previous day, or we could sell the stock we are holding.
2. If we own a stock, our profit could either remain the same as the previous day, or we could buy a new stock.

### Code

```javascript
function maxProfit(prices, fee) {
    let cash = 0;  // Maximum profit if we do not own a stock
    let hold = -prices[0];  // Maximum profit if we own a stock
    
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        // Transition from previous states: either keep the previous cash or sell the stock we are holding
        cash = Math.max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee);
        
        // Transition from previous states: either keep holding the previous stock or buy the new stock
        hold = Math.max(hold, cash - prices[i]);
    }
    
    return cash;  // The maximum profit will be in the cash state
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `prices` array. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once.

The space complexity is `O(1)`, as we are only using two extra variables (`cash` and `hold`) to keep track of our states.

By defining and updating the two states (`cash` and `hold`), we can efficiently compute the maximum profit we can achieve while accounting for the transaction fee.
