[Leetcode 1453. Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1453)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `r`. Return the maximum number of points that lie on or inside of a circular dartboard of radius `r`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before jumping to the solution, let’s clarify the problem with a few questions:
1. Are the points guaranteed to be within any specific bounds (e.g., within a certain range of coordinates)?
2. Can multiple points overlap at the same coordinates?
3. Is the radius `r` guaranteed to be positive?

For this problem, we will assume:
1. The coordinates of the points can vary widely.
2. Multiple points can indeed overlap.
3. The radius `r` is always positive.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using the following approach:

1. **Double Iteration with Distance Check:**
   - Iterate through each pair of points `(i, j)`.
   - For each pair, calculate the midpoint and the radius distance to determine if a circle can encompass a point.
   - Fine tune for all points around this circle center to determine the maximum number that fit within the circle.

2. **Circle Geometry:**
   - Use the midpoint and perpendicular bisector concepts to determine potential centers of circles that could cover the given points within radius `r`.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Use the Euclidean distance formula `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)` to check if a point lies within the circle.

### Code

Here’s how you can implement this algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
function numPoints(points, r) {
    const n = points.length;
    let maxPoints = 1;
    
    function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
        return Math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            const midX = (points[i][0] + points[j][0]) / 2;
            const midY = (points[i][1] + points[j][1]) / 2;
            const halfDist = distance(points[i][0], points[i][1], points[j][0], points[j][1]) / 2;

            if (halfDist <= r) {
                const dx = (points[i][0] - points[j][0]) / 2;
                const dy = (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) / 2;
                const h = Math.sqrt(r * r - halfDist * halfDist);
                const centers = [
                    [midX + h * dy, midY - h * dx],
                    [midX - h * dy, midY + h * dx]
                ];

                centers.forEach(center => {
                    const count = points.reduce((acc, point) => 
                        distance(center[0], center[1], point[0], point[1]) <= r ? acc + 1 : acc
                    , 0);
                    maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, count);
                });
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxPoints;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The above algorithm primarily consists of:
  - O(n^2) complexity for iterating through each pair of points.
  - O(n) complexity for the inner loop checking the distance of all points from potential circle centers.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^3).

This solution effectively identifies the centers of potential circles that can cover the most points through pair-wise evaluations and checks their distance to all points in the plane.
