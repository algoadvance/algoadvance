[Leetcode 473. Matchsticks to Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l473)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the `i`-th matchstick. You want to use all the matchsticks to make one square. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

Return true if you can make this square and false otherwise.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: matchsticks = [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square comes by linking two `1`s.

Input: matchsticks = [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot form a square with these matchsticks.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can matchsticks have a length of zero or negative? 
    - **No**, we assume lengths are positive integers.
2. Should the square sides be constructed in a particular order?
    - **No**, any order will do as long as the sides are equal in length.

### Strategy

1. **Check Sum Divisibility**: The sum of all matchsticks' lengths must be divisible by 4, as a square has four equal sides.
2. **Target Side Length**: If divisible, then the target side length for the square is the total sum divided by 4.
3. **DFS with Backtracking**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) combined with backtracking to attempt to construct four sides of the square with the matchsticks.

### Code

```javascript
function makesquare(matchsticks) {
    const sum = matchsticks.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    
    if (sum % 4 !== 0) return false;
    
    const target = sum / 4;
    matchsticks.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sorting in descending order
    
    const sides = new Array(4).fill(0);

    function dfs(index) {
        if (index === matchsticks.length) {
            return sides[0] === target && sides[1] === target && sides[2] === target && sides[3] === target;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if (sides[i] + matchsticks[index] <= target) {
                sides[i] += matchsticks[index];

                if (dfs(index + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }

                sides[i] -= matchsticks[index];
            }

            if (sides[i] === 0) {
                break; // Optimization to avoid redundant checks
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    return dfs(0);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(makesquare([1, 1, 2, 2, 2])); // Output: true
console.log(makesquare([3, 3, 3, 3, 4])); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the matchsticks takes \(O(N \log N)\) where \(N\) is the number of matchsticks.
- **DFS with Backtracking**: In the worst case, we explore all possible ways to partition the matchsticks into four groups, which might take \(O(4^N)\) time since each matchstick can potentially be part of any of the four sides.

Overall, the combined time complexity is \(O(N \log N) + O(4^N)\), which can be particularly intensive for larger inputs. However, the approach attempts to efficiently backtrack to minimize redundant checks.
