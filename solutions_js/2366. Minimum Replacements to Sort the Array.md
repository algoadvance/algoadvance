[Leetcode 2366. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2366)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace any element of the array with any two elements that sum to it.

- For example, consider `nums = [5, 6, 7]`. In one operation, we can replace `nums[1]` with `2` and `4` and convert `nums` to `[5, 2, 4, 7]`.

Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the least number of operations.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Operations definition**: Can we replace an element multiple times, and should the sum of the replacement elements always equal the original element?
    - Yes, any element can be replaced multiple times as long as the sum of the replacement elements equals the original element.

2. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the input array `nums`?
    - Let's assume typical constraints: `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9` and `1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`.

## Code

We'll utilize a greedy approach to solve this problem. We'll traverse the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring that each element is less than or equal to the next element by replacing it with multiple smaller elements if needed.

```javascript
var minimumReplacements = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let operations = 0;
    
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
            // Determine how many parts we should split nums[i] into
            let parts = Math.ceil(nums[i] / nums[i + 1]);
            operations += parts - 1;
            
            // The largest value of the parts
            nums[i] = Math.floor(nums[i] / parts);
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
};

// Example
console.log(minimumReplacements([5, 6, 7])); // Output: 0
console.log(minimumReplacements([5, 4, 3, 2])); // Example complex case
```

## Strategy

1. **Traversal from end to start**: Start traversing the array from the second to last element to the start.
2. **Identify when replacements are needed**: If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than the next element `nums[i + 1]`, replacements are needed.
3. **Calculate parts**: The number of parts we split `nums[i]` into is calculated using `Math.ceil(nums[i] / nums[i + 1])`.
4. **Increment operations**: Add `parts - 1` to our total number of operations because splitting into `parts` implies `parts - 1` replacements.
5. **Adjust element value**: Update `nums[i]` to the largest value of the parts, which is obtained by `Math.floor(nums[i] / parts)`.

This approach ensures we minimize the number of operations required to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n)
    - We traverse the list only once from end to start, performing constant-time operations per element.
- **Space complexity**: O(1)
    - We use only a few extra variables, and no additional data structures that scale with input size.
