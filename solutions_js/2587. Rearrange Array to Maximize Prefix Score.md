[Leetcode 2587. Rearrange Array to Maximize Prefix Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2587)
### Problem Statement

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, you have to rearrange the elements of `nums` to maximize the prefix score.

The prefix score of `nums` is defined by the sum of the prefix array. The prefix array `pi` of `nums` is defined as follows:
- `pi[0] = nums[0]`
- `pi[1] = nums[0] + nums[1]`
- `pi[2] = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`
- And so on...

Rearrange the `nums` to maximize the sum of the prefix array `pi`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input array allowed to have negative values?
   - Yes, input can include negative numbers.
2. What are the constraints on the size of the array?
   - The array length is in the range `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
3. How should we handle cases where there are multiple rearrangements that yield the same prefix score?
   - Any valid rearrangement that maximizes the prefix score is acceptable.

### Strategy

The key idea is to ensure that at every step while calculating the prefix score, we are adding the largest possible available value to the sum. This means sorting the array in non-increasing order (from largest to smallest) would give us the optimal arrangement.

1. Sort `nums` in descending order.
2. Return the sorted array.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var rearrangeArray = function(nums) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    return nums;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(rearrangeArray([1,2,3,4])); // Output: [4,3,2,1]
console.log(rearrangeArray([4,-1,3,2])); // Output: [4,3,2,-1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** The main computational task is sorting the array, which takes `O(n log n)` time complexity.
- **Returning the array:** This takes `O(1)` as it's just a simple return statement.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the function is **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is efficient given the constraints.
