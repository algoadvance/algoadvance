[Leetcode 633. Sum of Square Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l633)
## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = c \]

Return `true` if such pair exists, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `a` and `b` be negative?
   - No, by problem definition, we are dealing with non-negative integers.
2. What should be the returned result or exception for invalid inputs (like negative `c`)?
   - The problem states `c` is non-negative, hence this scenario doesn't need to be handled.
3. What is the maximum value of `c` we need to handle?
   - Assume `c` can be pretty large, even up to \(2^{31} - 1\).

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can utilize the following approach:

### Two-pointer Technique:
1. We will use two pointers, `a` starting from 0 and `b` starting from the integer closest to the square root of `c`.
2. We will repeatedly check if \(a^2 + b^2\) is equal to `c`.
3. If \(a^2 + b^2\) is less than `c`, increment `a`.
4. If \(a^2 + b^2\) is greater than `c`, decrement `b`.
5. Continue this process until `a` exceeds `b`.

This approach works because:
- By progressively increasing `a` and decreasing `b`, we can explore all potential pairs of squares efficiently.
- The maximum value for `b` starts at the integer closest to the square root of `c`, which optimizes the number of comparisons.

## Code
```javascript
function judgeSquareSum(c) {
    // Two pointers approach
    let a = 0;
    let b = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(c)); // b starts from the square root of c

    while (a <= b) {
        let sum = a * a + b * b;
        if (sum === c) {
            return true; // Found the pair
        } else if (sum < c) {
            a++; // Increment `a` to increase the sum
        } else {
            b--; // Decrement `b` to decrease the sum
        }
    }

    return false; // No valid pair found
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\sqrt{c})\)
  - The two pointers will traverse from 0 to the square root of `c`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We only use a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs efficiently without excessive computations.
