[Leetcode 1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1030)
### Problem Statement
Given the dimensions of a matrix `R` (rows) and `C` (columns), and the coordinates of a starting cell `(r0, c0)`, return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix sorted by their distance from `(r0, c0)` in increasing order. The distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is given by the Manhattan Distance formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2| \]

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Validity**: Are the provided dimensions (R and C) guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes.
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers representing the row and column of a cell?
   - Correct.
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like a matrix with only one cell?
   - Yes.

### Strategy
1. **Generate All Coordinates**: Generate all possible coordinates `(i, j)` for a matrix of dimensions `R x C`.
2. **Calculate Distances**: Calculate the Manhattan distance from the starting cell `(r0, c0)` for each generated coordinate.
3. **Sort the Coordinates**: Sort the list of coordinates based on the calculated distances.
4. **Return the Sorted List**: Return the sorted list of coordinates.

### Code
```javascript
function allCellsDistOrder(R, C, r0, c0) {
    const allCells = [];
    
    // Generate all coordinates
    for (let i = 0; i < R; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < C; j++) {
            allCells.push([i, j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Sort based on Manhattan distance from (r0, c0)
    allCells.sort((a, b) => {
        const distA = Math.abs(a[0] - r0) + Math.abs(a[1] - c0);
        const distB = Math.abs(b[0] - r0) + Math.abs(b[1] - c0);
        return distA - distB;
    });
    
    return allCells;
}

// Example usage:
// const R = 3, C = 3, r0 = 0, c0 = 0;
// console.log(allCellsDistOrder(R, C, r0, c0));
```

### Time Complexity
- **Generation Step**: Creating the list of all coordinates takes \(O(R \times C)\) time.
- **Sorting Step**: Sorting the list of coordinates based on their distances takes \(O((R \times C) \log(R \times C))\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(R \times C \log(R \times C)) \]

This solution ensures that all cells are sorted by their Manhattan distance from the starting cell in an efficient manner.
