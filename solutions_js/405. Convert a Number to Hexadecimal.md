[Leetcode 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l405)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode 405: Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative numbers, the hexadecimal representation should be in two's complement form, which implies addressing the 32 bits situation.

It should handle:
1. Positive integer inputs.
2. Negative integer inputs using twoâ€™s complement format for the representation of the negative number.
3. Zero case.
4. Requirements for the lowercase alphabets (a-f) for the values 10-15.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there a maximum limit to the input integer value?**
   - As per the problem, the integer should be within the 32-bit signed integer range (`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`).

2. **Should the hexadecimal string have any specific format?**
   - The answer should be lowercase without any leading `0x` prefix.

### Code
```javascript
function toHex(num) {
    if (num === 0) return "0";

    const hexChars = "0123456789abcdef";
    let result = '';
    
    // Handle two's complement for negative numbers by using 32-bit unsigned masking
    let n = num >>> 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        const hexDigit = hexChars[n & 15];
        result = hexDigit + result;
        n = n >>> 4; // shift right 4 bits
    }
  
    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(toHex(26));    // expected output: "1a"
console.log(toHex(-1));    // expected output: "ffffffff"
console.log(toHex(0));     // expected output: "0"
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialize**:
    - Create a string `hexChars` containing the characters `0-9` and `a-f`.
    - Create an empty result string.

2. **Special Case**: 
    - If the input number is `0`, return `"0"` immediately.

3. **Two's Complement Handling for Negative Numbers**:
    - Use zero-filled right shift (`>>> 0`) to handle the two's complement situation effectively. This converts negative numbers into their 32-bit unsigned representation.

4. **Hexadecimal Conversion**:
    - Loop through the number while it is greater than zero, extract the lower 4 bits (n & 15), get the corresponding hexadecimal character from `hexChars`, and prepend it to the result string.
    - Shift the number right by 4 bits (`n = n >>> 4`) and repeat.

5. **Return the Result**.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the conversion is O(log n) where n is the input number. Since the maximum number of bits we deal with is constant (32 bits for a 32-bit integer), this means the loop runs a constant number of times, making it effectively O(1) for practical purposes.
