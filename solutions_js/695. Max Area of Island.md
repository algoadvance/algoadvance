[Leetcode 695. Max Area of Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l695)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in the `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Will the input grid always be valid (non-empty and properly formatted)?
   - Yes, assume the input grid will always be a valid binary matrix.

2. **Range of Values**: What is the size limit for the grid `m` and `n`?
   - Typically, you can assume the size `m` and `n` to be within hundreds, but let's handle up to 50x50 grid size for practical purposes.

3. **Output Constraints**: Is the return value limited to non-negative integers?
   - Yes, the output (maximum area) will always be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy
1. **Traversal Technique**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore the islands. Alternatively, Breadth First Search (BFS) can also be used. Here we'll use DFS.
2. **Visitation Tracking**: Mark the cells as visited by modifying their values in the grid itself to avoid using extra space.
3. **Area Calculation**: For each unvisited land cell (`1`), initiate a DFS to calculate the area of the island and update the maximum area accordingly.
4. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure we stay within the grid boundaries while performing DFS.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxAreaOfIsland = function(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    let maxArea = 0;

    // Helper function for DFS
    function dfs(x, y) {
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n || grid[x][y] === 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Mark the cell as visited
        grid[x][y] = 0;

        // Initialize area for the current cell
        let area = 1;

        // Explore all 4 directions
        area += dfs(x + 1, y);
        area += dfs(x - 1, y);
        area += dfs(x, y + 1);
        area += dfs(x, y - 1);

        return area;
    }

    // Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                // If it's part of an island, compute its area using DFS
                const currentArea = dfs(i, j);
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Since we visit each cell at most once, this ensures we visit all cells in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) in the worst case due to the recursive call stack size in DFS. However, we do not use additional space for marking cells as visited, leveraging the input grid for this purpose.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the problem constraints effectively.
