[Leetcode 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l107)
## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

Example:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the expected output if the input is an empty tree (i.e., `root` is `null`)?
   - The output should be an empty list `[]`.

2. Can there be any duplicate values in the tree?
   - Yes, the tree can contain duplicate values.

3. Do we need to maintain the internal node ordering from left to right within each level?
   - Yes, we need to maintain the left-to-right order for nodes within the same level.

## Strategy

1. We'll perform a level order traversal (BFS - Breadth-First Search) of the tree.
2. Instead of collecting node values level by level from top to bottom, we will collect them from bottom to top.
3. We can achieve this by using a queue to facilitate level-by-level traversal and a stack (or simply prepend to a list) to collect the levels in reverse order.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var levelOrderBottom = function(root) {
    if (root === null) {
        return [];
    }
    
    const result = [];
    const queue = [];
    queue.push(root);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        const currentLevel = [];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const currentNode = queue.shift();
            currentLevel.push(currentNode.val);
            
            if (currentNode.left !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.left);
            }
            if (currentNode.right !== null) {
                queue.push(currentNode.right);
            }
        }
        
        result.unshift(currentLevel);  // add the current level at the beginning to get the reverse order
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is for the queue used in BFS and the result list. In the worst case, the queue will hold N/2 nodes (in case of a full binary tree) at the last level.

This ensures an efficient approach, handling the bottom-up level order traversal while maintaining the left-to-right order within each level.
