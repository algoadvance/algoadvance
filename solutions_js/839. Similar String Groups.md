[Leetcode 839. Similar String Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l839)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `strs`. Two strings are said to be similar if they can be obtained from one another by swapping any two characters exactly once. Additionally, two strings `A` and `B` are said to be connected if there is a sequence of similar strings that starts with `A` and ends with `B`.

Return the number of groups of similar strings in `strs`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the length of each string in `strs`?
2. What is the maximum number of strings in `strs`?
3. Are all strings in `strs` guaranteed to have the same length?
4. Can we assume input strings consist of only lowercase English letters?

Assuming typical constraints:
- Length of each string (`n`): 1 <= `n` <= 100
- Number of strings (`m`): 1 <= `m` <= 300
- All strings have the same length.
- Strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Similarity:** Two strings are similar if they can be made identical by swapping two characters.
2. **Union-Find Data Structure:** To manage grouping, we can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set) structure. Each time two strings are identified as similar, they will be in the same group (or subset).
3. **Traverse Pairs:** For each pair of strings, check if they are similar. If they are, union their sets.
4. **Count Unique Groups:** After processing all pairs, count the number of unique sets to determine the number of groups.

Similar function definition:
- `areSimilar(s1, s2)` - Returns true if strings `s1` and `s2` are similar.

## Code
```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

function areSimilar(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
    
    let pairs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; ++i) {
        if (s1[i] !== s2[i]) {
            pairs.push([s1[i], s2[i]]);
            if (pairs.length > 2) return false;
        }
    }
    return pairs.length === 0 || (pairs.length === 2 && pairs[0][0] === pairs[1][1] && pairs[0][1] === pairs[1][0]);
}

var numSimilarGroups = function(strs) {
    const n = strs.length;
    const uf = new UnionFind(n);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (areSimilar(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                uf.union(i, j);
            }
        }
    }

    let groups = new Set();
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        groups.add(uf.find(i));
    }
    
    return groups.size;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The `areSimilar` function runs in `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of the strings.
- The nested loops to compare each pair of strings run in `O(m^2)` where `m` is the number of strings.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m^2 * n)`, with `m` being the number of strings, and `n` being the length of each string. The Union-Find operations are essentially `O(1)` due to path compression and union by rank.

This approach should be efficient given reasonable constraints on input sizes.
