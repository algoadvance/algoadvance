[Leetcode 1385. Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1385)
## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and an integer `d`, return the distance value between the two arrays.

The distance value is defined as the number of elements `arr1[i]` such that there is not any element `arr2[j]` where `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d`.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```javascript
Input: arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
For arr1[0]=4, there is no arr2[j] such that |4-10|<=2, |4-9|<=2, |4-1|<=2, |4-8|<=2.
For arr1[1]=5, there is no arr2[j] such that |5-10|<=2, |5-9|<=2, |5-1|<=2, |5-8|<=2.
For arr1[2]=8, arr2[3]=8 since |8-8|<=2.
```

**Example 2:**
```javascript
Input: arr1 = [1,4,2,3], arr2 = [10,9,8,7], d = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**
```javascript
Input: arr1 = [2,1,100,3], arr2 = [-5,-2,10,-3,7], d = 6
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the arrays contain duplicate elements?
2. Is it guaranteed that both arrays contain at least one element?
3. Are the integer values within a specific range?
4. Can the value of `d` be negative? (assuming it can't be since it's a distance)

## Strategy
To find the distance value between two arrays:
1. Iterate through each element of `arr1`.
2. For each element in `arr1`, check if there exists any element in `arr2` such that the absolute difference `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d`.
3. Use a flag to determine if such an element exists. If not, increment the distance value count.

## Code

```javascript
function findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) {
    let distanceValue = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        let isValid = true;
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(arr1[i] - arr2[j]) <= d) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isValid) {
            distanceValue++;
        }
    }

    return distanceValue;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findTheDistanceValue([4,5,8], [10,9,1,8], 2));  // Expected output: 2
console.log(findTheDistanceValue([1,4,2,3], [10,9,8,7], 4)); // Expected output: 2
console.log(findTheDistanceValue([2,1,100,3], [-5,-2,10,-3,7], 6)); // Expected output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above code is O(n * m) where `n` is the length of `arr1` and `m` is the length of `arr2` because we are using nested loops to compare each element of `arr1` with each element of `arr2`. This straightforward approach may be optimized, but it ensures clarity and correctness.

If needed, we can sort `arr2` and use binary search to try and reduce the complexity of finding an element within distance `d`, but that would add complexity to the solution.
