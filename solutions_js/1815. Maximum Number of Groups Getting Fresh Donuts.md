[Leetcode 1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1815)
### Problem Statement
You are given a group whose size is a multiple of `batchSize`. Each group needs to be divided to maximize the number of complete groups that can get fresh donuts.

The task is to find the maximum number of groups you can get fresh donuts if every group size is a multiple of `batchSize`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints for this problem? 
   - Constraints usually specify the range of the input values.
2. Can we assume that `batchSize` is always a positive integer?
3. Are there any upper limits on the size of groups or the number of people?

Assuming typical constraints, let's write out our strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Residue Analysis**: Since donuts are given in `batchSize`, it is crucial to group the sizes based on their mod values with respect to `batchSize`.
2. **Count Residues**: Create an array to count occurrences of each residue.
3. **Pairing Residues**: Look for pairs of residues that together add up to form a complete batch (i.e., their sum modulo `batchSize` is zero).
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to maximize the number of groups.
   - Using a memoization approach to store previously computed states to avoid recomputation.

### Code

```javascript
var maxHappyGroups = function(batchSize, groups) {
    const n = groups.length;
    let freq = new Array(batchSize).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        freq[groups[i] % batchSize]++;
    }

    // Special case for remainder 0, these can always form happy groups
    let res = freq[0];
    
    let memo = new Map();
    function dfs(stateBitmask) {
        if (memo.has(stateBitmask)) return memo.get(stateBitmask);
        
        let sumRemainder = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < batchSize; i++) {
            if (stateBitmask & (1 << i)) {
                sumRemainder = (sumRemainder + i) % batchSize;
            }
        }
        
        let maxGroups = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < batchSize; i++) {
            if (stateBitmask & (1 << i)) {
                // If this batch count of remainder i can be decreased
                let nextState = stateBitmask ^ (1 << i);
                let addedGroups = (sumRemainder === 0) ? 1 : 0;
                maxGroups = Math.max(maxGroups, addedGroups + dfs(nextState));
            }
        }
        
        memo.set(stateBitmask, maxGroups);
        return maxGroups;
    }
    
    let initialBitmask = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < batchSize; i++) {
        if (freq[i] > 0) {
            initialBitmask |= (1 << i);
        }
    }
    
    res += dfs(initialBitmask);
    return res;
};

// Example usage:
let batchSize = 3;
let groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
console.log(maxHappyGroups(batchSize, groups));  // Output the maximum number of happy groups
```

### Explanation
1. **Frequency Array**: We calculate the count of each residue when divided by `batchSize`.
2. **Initial Groups**: Groups with a remainder of 0 are automatically happy groups.
3. **Memoization with Bit Masking**: We use a bitmask to represent subsets of remainder counts. This helps in reducing the problem complexity by keeping track of the remainder sums efficiently.
4. **Recursive DP Function**: `dfs` function performs the depth-first search to calculate the maximum number of happy groups using memoized values. 

### Time Complexity
- **O(2^batchSize * batchSize)**: Due to bitmasking and memoization for each state, the complexity involves considering each subset of sizes optimally. With memoization, checking each state is efficient.
  
This solution leverages dynamic programming with recursive state tracking, ensuring efficient computation while maximizing groups getting fresh donuts.
