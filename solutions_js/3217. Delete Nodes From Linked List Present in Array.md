[Leetcode 3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3217)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list and an array of integers `arr` containing distinct values. You need to delete the nodes from the linked list whose values appear in the array `arr`.

Your task is to implement a function `deleteNodes(head, arr)` that performs the necessary deletions and returns the head of the modified linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q1:** What should be returned if the list is empty?
  - **A1:** An empty list (i.e., return `null`).
  
- **Q2:** What should be done if `arr` contains values not in the linked list?
  - **A2:** Those values should be ignored; only nodes present in the linked list and `arr` need to be deleted.

- **Q3:** Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list or the array?
  - **A3:** No specific constraints provided, but the usual constraints for typical LeetCode problems apply.

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Convert array `arr` into a Set for O(1) average time complexity checks.

2. **Pointer Initialization:**
   - Create a dummy node pointing to the head of the list for easier manipulation of the head node.
   - Use two pointers, `prev` starting at the dummy node and `current` starting at the head of the list.

3. **Traversal and Deletion:**
   - Iterate through the list using the `current` pointer.
   - For each node, check if its value is in the Set.
       - If yes, adjust the `next` pointer of `prev` to skip the current node.
       - If no, move the `prev` pointer to the current node.
   - Move the `current` pointer to the next node.

4. **Return:**
   - Return the node pointed to by the dummy node's `next` pointer.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function deleteNodes(head, arr) {
    // Step 1: Convert array `arr` to a Set for faster look-up.
    const valueSet = new Set(arr);
    
    // Step 2: Initialize a dummy node
    const dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    
    let prev = dummy;
    let current = head;
    
    // Step 3: Traverse the linked list and delete nodes.
    while (current !== null) {
        if (valueSet.has(current.val)) {
            // Skip the current node
            prev.next = current.next;
        } else {
            // Move the prev pointer
            prev = current;
        }
        // Move the current pointer
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // Step 4: Return the modified list starting with dummy.next
    return dummy.next;
}

// Helper function to print linked list
function printList(head) {
    let current = head;
    while (current !== null) {
        process.stdout.write(current.val + " -> ");
        current = current.next;
    }
    console.log("null");
}

// Example Usage
let list = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4))));
let arr = [2, 3];

list = deleteNodes(list, arr);
printList(list); // Output should be: 1 -> 4 -> null
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** O(k) to convert array `arr` with `k` elements to a Set.
- **Traversal and Deletion:** O(n) to traverse the linked list with `n` nodes.

The overall time complexity is O(n + k).
