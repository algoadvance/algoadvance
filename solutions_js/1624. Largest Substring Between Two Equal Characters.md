[Leetcode 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1624)
## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1624: Find the length of the largest substring between two equal characters, excluding the characters themselves.

**Constraints:**
1. The string will contain only lowercase English letters.

**Example:**
- Input: "abca"
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The largest substring is "bc" with length 2.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Does the string contain only alphabetic characters?
   - A: Yes, the string contains only lowercase English letters.
2. Q: What if there are multiple pairs of equal characters?
   - A: You need to find the maximum length between the characters.

## Strategy
1. Use a map to store the first occurrence index of each character.
2. Traverse the string: 
   - If we encounter a character for the first time, store its index.
   - If we encounter it again, calculate the length of the substring between the first and current occurrences and update the maximum length.
3. Continue till the end of the string.
4. Return the maximum length found.

## Code
```javascript
function maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(s) {
    let charIndexMap = new Map();
    let maxLength = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (charIndexMap.has(s[i])) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - charIndexMap.get(s[i]) - 1);
        } else {
            charIndexMap.set(s[i], i);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Sample Test Case
console.log(maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters("abca"));  // Output: 2
console.log(maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters("cbzxy"));  // Output: -1
console.log(maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters("cabbac"));  // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, since we are traversing the string once.
- The space complexity is O(1) in the best case (all characters are unique) and O(n) in the worst case (all characters are the same).
