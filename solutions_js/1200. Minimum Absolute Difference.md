[Leetcode 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1200)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. Return a list of pairs in ascending order (with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows:
- `a, b` are from `arr`
- `a < b`
- `b - a` equals the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a list of lists. Each list contains two integers `[a, b]` such that the difference between `a` and `b` is minimal and they are in ascending order both within the pair and within the entire list of pairs.

2. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array or the range of numbers?**
   - The array `arr` will contain between `2` and `10^5` integers. Each integer in the array will be between `-10^6` and `10^6`.

3. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - No, the array contains distinct integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the array:** Sorting the array will help in finding the minimum absolute difference efficiently.
2. **Find the minimum absolute difference:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array, and calculate the difference between each consecutive pair.
   - Track the minimum difference found.
3. **Collect pairs with the minimum difference:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array again, and collect all pairs that have the minimum difference.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumAbsDifference(arr) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let minDiff = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    const result = [];

    // Find the minimum absolute difference
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        const diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
        }
    }

    // Collect all pairs with the minimum absolute difference
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] === minDiff) {
            result.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array:** The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time where \(n\) is the number of elements in `arr`.
2. **Finding the Minimum Difference:** The first loop runs in \(O(n)\) to find the minimum difference.
3. **Collecting the Pairs:** The second loop also runs in \(O(n)\) to collect all pairs with the minimum difference.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Example

```javascript
// Example Usage
const arr = [4, 2, 1, 3];
console.log(minimumAbsDifference(arr));
// Output: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
```
