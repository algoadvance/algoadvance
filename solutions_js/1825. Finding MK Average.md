[Leetcode 1825. Finding MK Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1825)
### Problem Statement
You have a stream of integers. You need to implement the `MKAverage` class:

- `MKAverage(int m, int k)` Initializes the `MKAverage` object with two integers `m` and `k`.
- `void addElement(int num)` Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.
- `int calculateMKAverage()` Returns the MKAverage of the last `m` elements of the stream. The MKAverage is calculated as follows:
  - Consider the last `m` elements.
  - Remove the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements.
  - Calculate the average of the remaining `m - 2 * k` elements and return it rounded down to the nearest integer.

If the number of elements in the stream is less than `m`, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the elements in the stream be processed in the order they arrive?
2. Since the question involves a stream of integers, how frequently will the `addElement` and `calculateMKAverage` methods be called compared to each other?
3. What are the constraints on `m` and `k`?

Assume we have enough context to proceed with the implementation.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**: Use a deque or list to maintain the last `m` elements. Use multiple heaps or sorted collections (e.g., `SortedList`) to manage the smallest `k`, largest `k`, and middle elements for efficient removal and addition.
2. **Insertion**: When a new element is inserted:
   - If the total number of elements exceeds `m`, remove the oldest element.
   - Ensure all data structures are kept updated with the new and potentially removed element.
3. **Calculation**: To calculate the MKAverage:
   - If there are fewer than `m` elements, return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, use the pre-maintained collections to remove the smallest `k` and largest `k` elements, then compute the average of the remaining elements.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class MKAverage {
  constructor(m, k) {
    this.m = m;
    this.k = k;
    this.stream = [];
    this.sortedStream = [];
  }

  // Function to add a new element into the stream
  addElement(num) {
    this.stream.push(num);
    
    // Selective insertion to keep by using binary search pattern for sorted array
    let index = this.binarySearch(this.sortedStream, num);
    this.sortedStream.splice(index, 0, num);

    if (this.stream.length > this.m) {
      const oldest = this.stream.shift();
      const oldestIndex = this.binarySearch(this.sortedStream, oldest);
      this.sortedStream.splice(oldestIndex, 1);
    }
  }

  // Function to calculate the MKAverage
  calculateMKAverage() {
    if (this.stream.length < this.m) {
      return -1;
    }

    const slice = this.sortedStream.slice(this.k, this.m - this.k);
    const sum = slice.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    return Math.floor(sum / slice.length);
  }

  // Helper function to find the insertion point for binary search
  binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0, right = arr.length;
    while (left < right) {
      const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
      if (arr[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid;
      }
    }
    return left;
  }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Insertion (`addElement`)**: 
   - Inserting into the stream array - O(1)
   - Finding the position to insert in the sorted array - O(log m)
   - Inserting into the sorted array - O(m), but amortized for binary insertion it's O(log m)
   - So total: O(m + log m)

2. **MKAverage Calculation (`calculateMKAverage`)**:
   - If elements are fewer than `m` - O(1)
   - Slicing the array - O(m)
   - Summing the sliced array - O(m)
   - So total: O(m)

The provided implementation is intended to balance ease of understanding and performance. There may be further optimizations possible by leveraging more advanced data structures such as balanced BSTs or custom heaps for further optimization.
