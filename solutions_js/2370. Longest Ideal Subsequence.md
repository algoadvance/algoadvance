[Leetcode 2370. Longest Ideal Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2370)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a **k-ideal subsequence** is a subsequence of `s` where the absolute difference between the ASCII values of any two consecutive characters is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the length of the longest k-ideal subsequence.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest k-ideal subsequence is "acfd".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest k-ideal subsequence is "abcd".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the subsequence need to maintain the order of characters as in the original string `s`?
   - Yes, a subsequence maintains the order of characters.

2. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s` and the value of `k`?
   - Usually, detailed constraints would be given, but let's assume constraints according to typical LeetCode problem descriptions (e.g., `1 <= s.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 25`).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, dynamic programming (DP) is an appropriate approach:

1. We will maintain a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest k-ideal subsequence ending with character `'a' + i`.
2. Iterate over each character in the string `s`.
3. For each character, update the DP array considering potential k-ideal characters that can precede it.
4. The result will be the maximum value in the DP array because any of these could be the end of the longest k-ideal subsequence.

## Code

```javascript
function longestIdealString(s, k) {
    const dp = new Array(26).fill(0);

    for (let char of s) {
        const index = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        let maxLen = 0;

        for (let i = Math.max(0, index - k); i <= Math.min(25, index + k); i++) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp[i]);
        }
        
        dp[index] = maxLen + 1;
    }

    return Math.max(...dp);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestIdealString("acfgbd", 2)); // Output: 4
console.log(longestIdealString("abcd", 3));   // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed as follows:

- The outer loop iterates through each character in the string `s`, making it `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- The inner loop iterates over a range of at most `2k+1` (for each character in the substring defined by `k`), making it `O(k)`.

Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(n * k)`.

This approach is efficient and should work within the typical constraint limits on LeetCode.
