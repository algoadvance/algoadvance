[Leetcode 3165. Maximum Sum of Subsequence With Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3165)
### Problem Statement

You need to determine the maximum sum of a subsequence in a given list of integers where no two elements of the subsequence are adjacent in the original array. This is a well-known problem commonly referred to as the "House Robber" problem.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array?**
   - Typically, arrays can range from a few elements to millions, but specific constraints would help.

2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, this could affect the strategy as negative numbers may reduce the sum.

3. **What should be the output if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, the maximum sum should be 0.

4. **Is it sufficient to return the maximum sum or should we also return the actual subsequence?**
   - Usually, returning the maximum sum suffices, but confirm as needed.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use dynamic programming where we'll keep track of two scenarios:
        1. **Include the current element**: If we include the current element, then the previous element cannot be included.
        2. **Exclude the current element**: If we exclude the current element, then we take the maximum sum up to the previous element.

2. **Transition Formula:**
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum sum we can achieve up to the `i-th` element without taking two consecutive elements.
   - The state transition can be defined as:
     - `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + (dp[i-2] if i > 1 else 0))`

3. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = arr[0]` since the maximum sum of a single element list is the element itself.
   - `dp[1] = max(arr[0], arr[1])` for the second element.

4. **Compute the result iteratively:**
   - Traverse the array and apply the transition formula.

### Code

```javascript
function maxNonAdjacentSum(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

    let n = nums.length;
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Initialize base cases
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2]);
    }

    return dp[n-1];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxNonAdjacentSum([3, 2, 5, 10, 7])); // Outputs: 15 (3 + 10 + 2)
console.log(maxNonAdjacentSum([])); // Outputs: 0
console.log(maxNonAdjacentSum([-2, 1, 3, -4, 5])); // Outputs: 8 (1 + 3 + 5)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We simply traverse through the array once.

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We use an array `dp` to store the maximum sum up to each element.
  - It can be optimized to \( O(1) \) by using two variables to store the last two states, but the current solution is straightforward and clear.
