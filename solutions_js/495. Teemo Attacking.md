[Leetcode 495. Teemo Attacking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l495)
### Problem Statement:

495. Teemo Attacking

In the game, a character named Teemo attacks an enemy with poisonous darts. When Teemo attacks the enemy, the enemyâ€™s health drops immediately by some points and remains down for a certain duration known as poisoning time. 

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes the time of the i-th attack, and an integer `duration` that represents the poisoning time after a Teemo attack. 

Return the total time that the enemy is in a poisoned condition.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the array always sorted in non-decreasing order?**
   - Yes, the array `timeSeries` is always given in non-decreasing order.

2. **Will `timeSeries` always have at least one attack time?**
   - Yes, `timeSeries` will have at least one element.

3. **What should be returned if `duration` is 0?**
   - If `duration` is 0, the enemy is never poisoned, so the total poisoned time should be 0.

4. **How should overlapping durations be handled?**
   - If an attack occurs during an already active poison duration, only the overlapping part should count once.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialize the total poisoned time:** Start with a variable to keep track of the total poisoned duration.
  
2. **Iterate through the `timeSeries` array:** 
   - For each attack time, calculate the end of the poisoning duration.
   - If the current attack happens before the previous poison duration ends, only count the non-overlapping duration.
   - Otherwise, add the full duration of the poisoning.

3. **Edge Cases:** 
   - Single attack (only one duration count).
   - When all attacks are spaced out such that no overlapping occurs.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `timeSeries`, as we are iterating through the array only once.

### Code:

```javascript
function findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries, duration) {
  if (duration === 0) return 0;

  let totalPoisonedDuration = 0;
  let endOfPreviousPoison = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < timeSeries.length; i++) {
    const currentAttackTime = timeSeries[i];

    if (currentAttackTime < endOfPreviousPoison) {
      totalPoisonedDuration += currentAttackTime + duration - endOfPreviousPoison;
    } else {
      totalPoisonedDuration += duration;
    }

    endOfPreviousPoison = currentAttackTime + duration;
  }

  return totalPoisonedDuration;
}

// Example Usage:
const timeSeries = [1, 4, 5]; 
const duration = 2;
console.log(findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries, duration)); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - `totalPoisonedDuration` keeps track of the total duration for which the enemy is poisoned.
   - `endOfPreviousPoison` is the time when the last poisoning period ends.

2. **Iterate through `timeSeries`:**
   - If the current attack occurs before the previous poison ends, add only the additional duration to the total poisoned time (`currentAttackTime + duration - endOfPreviousPoison`).
   - If it occurs after the previous poison ends, add the full duration (`duration`).

3. **Updating `endOfPreviousPoison`:** 
   - Each iteration updates the end time of the poison to account for the most recent attack.

This ensures that overlapping durations are handled efficiently and accurately.
