[Leetcode 2815. Max Pair Sum in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2815)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to find the maximum possible sum of a pair of numbers in the array. A pair consists of two different elements at different positions in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What if the array has fewer than two elements?**
   - We'll assume that the input will always have at least two elements.
2. **Can the elements in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements can be negative, positive, or zero.
3. **Should we consider pairs with the same elements or only distinct pairs?**
   - We can consider pairs of distinct elements at different positions.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sorting the array will allow us to quickly find the largest two numbers.
2. **Find the Two Largest Elements**:
   - After sorting the array, the two largest elements will be the last two elements in the sorted array.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxPairSum(nums) {
    // Sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // The maximum pair sum will be the sum of the last two elements in the sorted array
    let n = nums.length;
    return nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxPairSum([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: 7
console.log(maxPairSum([-1, -2, -3, -4])); // Output: -3
console.log(maxPairSum([5, 3, 1, 7, 2])); // Output: 12
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
- Accessing the last two elements of the sorted array is `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n log n)`. This is efficient for most input sizes you would typically encounter in interview scenarios.
