[Leetcode 902. Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l902)
## Problem Statement

We are given a sorted array of digits `D` (which are strings representing digits from 1-9) and a positive integer `N`. We need to return the number of positive integers that can be written using the digits from `D` that are less than or equal to `N`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value of `N` and size of `D`?**
   - Typically, constraints such as `N <= 10^9` and `|D| <= 9` are given.

2. **Can `D` contain duplicates?**
   - No, `D` is given to be a sorted array without duplicates.

3. **Are the digits in `D` guaranteed to be non-zero?**
   - Yes, `D` contains digits from 1-9, so no zero is present.

## Strategy

1. **Length Comparison**:
    - To start, let's determine how many numbers we can form that have fewer digits than `N`. For example, if `N` has 3 digits, we can form 1-digit and 2-digit numbers freely with the digits in `D`.

2. **Same Length Numbers**:
    - For numbers with the same number of digits as `N`, we need to be more cautious:
        - We compare digit by digit, and based on the comparison, decide how many valid numbers can be formed.

3. **Counting**:
    - Count the numbers that can be formed for each digit length from 1 to the length of `N`.
    - Use a recursive function or dynamic programming to handle the numbers of the same length as `N`.

## Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation based on the described strategy:

```javascript
function atMostNGivenDigitSet(D, N) {
    const digits = D.map(Number);
    const nStr = N.toString();
    const nLength = nStr.length;
    let count = 0;

    // Count numbers with fewer digits than N
    for (let i = 1; i < nLength; ++i) {
        count += Math.pow(digits.length, i);
    }

    // Count numbers with the same length as N
    function countSameLength(idx) {
        if (idx >= nStr.length) return 1;

        let currentDigit = parseInt(nStr[idx]);
        let result = 0;

        for (let d of digits) {
            if (d < currentDigit) {
                result += Math.pow(digits.length, nStr.length - idx - 1);
            } else if (d === currentDigit) {
                result += countSameLength(idx + 1);
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    count += countSameLength(0);
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Length Comparison for All Lesser Digit Numbers**: This uses a loop from 1 to `log10(N)`, and computes powers `Math.pow(digits.length, k)`. This is efficient and runs in \(O(\log N)\).
- **Handling Same Length Numbers**: This involves potentially exploring each digit position in `N`. In the worst case, where `N` has `d` digits and each digit branch can lead to `digits.length` subproblems, it may take \(O(d \cdot |D|)\). Given practical constraints, this is manageable.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log N \cdot |D|)\).
