[Leetcode 2059. Minimum Operations to Convert Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2059)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing distinct numbers, an integer start, and an integer goal. 

There is an integer x initially set to start, and you want to perform operations on x such that it becomes equal to goal. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any number from nums and add it to x (i.e., perform `x = x + num`).
- Pick any number from nums and subtract it from x (i.e., perform `x = x - num`).
- Pick any number from nums and XOR it with x (i.e., perform `x = x ^ num`).

Your task is to return the minimum number of operations needed for x to become equal to goal, or -1 if it is not possible.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 4, 12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 2 → 2 + 12 = 14 → 14 ^ 2 = 12. We used 2 operations.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range and constraints:** What are the constraints on the values in the `nums` array and the values of `start` and `goal`?
   
2. **Range of operations:** Can operations lead to negative or very large positive values? Do we need to account for integer overflow or underflow?
   
3. **Termination condition:** Should we stop exploring a path if it already overshoots the goal? Or is there no such bound and we must explore all possible paths?

## Strategy

Given that each number from `nums` can be used in three different ways (add, subtract, XOR), this problem can effectively be seen as navigating a state space graph. Breadth-first Search (BFS) is a suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which makes it apt for our purposes here.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize:** Use a queue to track each state `(current_value, operations_count)`.
2. **Visited Set:** Use a set to record visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.
3. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Dequeue a state and apply each possible operation using numbers from `nums`.
   - Check if the resultant value matches `goal`.
   - For each resultant value, if it hasn't been visited, enqueue it with incremented operation count.
4. **Termination:** Return the operation count immediately when `goal` is reached, or return -1 if the queue is exhausted without finding the goal.

### Time Complexity

Since each state can potentially generate three new states and BFS ensures that we process each level of the state space fully before moving to the next:

- **State Space:** Each unique value `x` produces up to `3 * len(nums)` new values.
- **Overall Complexity:** Highly dependent on the specific scenario, but BFS ensures minimal operations and visits each value optimally.

## Code

```javascript
function minimumOperations(nums, start, goal) {
    const queue = [[start, 0]];
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(start);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [current, steps] = queue.shift();
        
        if (current === goal) {
            return steps;
        }
        
        for (let num of nums) {
            const operations = [current + num, current - num, current ^ num];
            for (let next of operations) {
                if (next === goal) {
                    return steps + 1;
                }
                if (next >= 0 && next <= 1000 && !visited.has(next)) {
                    visited.add(next);
                    queue.push([next, steps + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Queue and Visited Set:** Initialize the BFS queue with the starting value and mark it as visited.
2. **BFS Loop:** Process nodes by dequeuing and examining each possible operation result.
3. **Boundary Checks:** Ensure the next values are within the acceptable bounds and not previously visited.
4. **Goal Check:** Return the current step count when the goal is reached directly.

This approach guarantees finding the minimum number of operations needed to transform `start` to `goal`.
