[Leetcode 1883. Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1883)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers `dist` and two integers `speed` and `hoursBefore`. The `dist` array represents the distances between successive checkpoints. The speed is your constant speed while traveling, and `hoursBefore` indicates the time you have to arrive at the destination from the starting point.

Each distance must be traveled completely before moving on to the next, and for each checkpoint except for the last one, the time taken will be rounded up to the next whole number (i.e., `Math.ceil(time)`).

The task is to determine the minimum number of skips needed to arrive at the final checkpoint within the given time. A skip means you ignore the rounding up at one checkpoint, moving directly to the next.

If it is not possible to reach the destination within the given time, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of elements in the `dist` array?
2. What is the maximum length of the `dist` array?
3. Is the `speed` always a positive integer?
4. Can `hoursBefore` be a non-integer?
5. Are there any constraints on `dist` such as all positive numbers?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming (DP). We will maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum time taken to reach the `i`-th checkpoint with exactly `j` skips. We aim to fill this table and find the smallest `j` such that `dp[n][j] <= hoursBefore`, where `n` is the number of checkpoints.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize the DP Table**: Create a table where `dp[i][j]` starts with a high value (representing infeasibility).
2. **Iterate Over Each Checkpoint**: For each checkpoint `i` and each possible number of skips `j`.
3. **Calculate Time Without Skip**: Update the table value by considering the time taken without any skip.
4. **Calculate Time With Skip**: Also, update the table value by considering the time taken with a skip if applicable.
5. **Determine the Minimum Skips**: Find the minimum `j` such that the total travel time is within `hoursBefore`.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} dist
 * @param {number} speed
 * @param {number} hoursBefore
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSkips = function(dist, speed, hoursBefore) {
    const n = dist.length;
    const inf = 1e9;
    const timeLimit = hoursBefore * speed;
    
    // dp[i][j] means the minimum time used to reach checkpoint i with exactly j skips
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(inf));
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        const t = dist[i - 1];
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            // If we don't skip 
            if (j < i) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], Math.ceil(dp[i - 1][j] / speed) * speed + t);
            }
            // If we skip
            if (j > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + t);
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
        if (dp[n][j] <= timeLimit) {
            return j;
        }
    }
    return -1;
};

// Example usage:
// console.log(minSkips([1,3,2], 4, 2));  // Expected Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n^2), where `n` is the number of distances in the `dist` array. We iterate over each checkpoint and, for each checkpoint, over each possible number of skips.
- The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the DP table.

This approach ensures we efficiently calculate the minimum number of skips needed to arrive on time, using dynamic programming to explore all possible paths systematically.
