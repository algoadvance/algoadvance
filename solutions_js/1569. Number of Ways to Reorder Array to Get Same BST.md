[Leetcode 1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1569)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` that represents a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`, we need to determine the number of ways to reorder the array such that the Binary Search Tree (BST) constructed from this reordered array is identical to the BST built from the original array `nums`.

A BST is constructed using the following process:
1. Initialize the BST with the root as `nums[0]`.
2. Insert subsequent elements into the BST one by one.

Two binary trees are considered identical if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

We need to return the result **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums`?
   - The size of the array `nums` can be up to 1000.

2. **Value Range**: Are the values in the array guaranteed to be unique and within a certain range?
   - Yes, the values are unique and are a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

3. **Modulo Requirement**: Explicitly confirm that the result needs to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - Yes, the result must be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy
1. **BST Construction**: Since we are interested in maintaining the same BST, we need to ensure that the relative ordering of elements (left and right children of each node) in any new permutation matches the original BST.
2. **Combinatorics**: Constructing the new permutations will require combinatorial logic. Specifically, for any node, we have to combine the ways to permute its left and right children subtrees.
3. **Recursive Approach**: Use recursion to divide the problem into subproblems where we calculate the number of ways to reorder left and right subtrees and then combine these results.
4. **Precompute Combinations**: Given the constraint of up to 1000 elements, precompute combinations (`n choose k`) for efficient look-up during recursive calls.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
let comb;

function initializeCombination(n) {
    comb = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        comb[i][0] = comb[i][i] = 1;
        for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            comb[i][j] = (comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j]) % MOD;
        }
    }
}

function numOfWays(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    initializeCombination(n + 1);
    return (countWays(nums) - 1 + MOD) % MOD;
}

function countWays(nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 2) return 1;
    
    const root = nums[0];
    const left = nums.filter(num => num < root);
    const right = nums.filter(num => num > root);

    const leftWays = countWays(left);
    const rightWays = countWays(right);

    return (comb[left.length + right.length][left.length] * leftWays % MOD * rightWays % MOD) % MOD;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numOfWays([2, 1, 3])); // Expected output: 1
console.log(numOfWays([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])); // Expected output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Function Call**: Each recursive call creates a partition and processes left and right subtrees independently.
2. **Combination Precomputation**: The combination table is precomputed in `O(n^2)` time.
3. **Overall Recursive Process**: Each call on an array of size `n` results in left and right subcalls, leading to approximately `O(n log n)` behaviour, dominated by partitioning and combining results.

Hence, the overall time complexity is effectively managed to `O(n^2)` due to precomputation and recursive structure.

This solution ensures efficiency and correctness by leveraging combinatorial precomputation and recursive structure for solving the problem as described.
