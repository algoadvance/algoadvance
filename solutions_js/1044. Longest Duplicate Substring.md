[Leetcode 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1044)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the longest substring that appears at least twice. Note that your output can be any of them. If no such substring exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` can be up to `3 * 10^4`.

2. **What characters are present in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **What should be returned if no duplicate substring exists?**
   - Return an empty string.

4. **What are the performance constraints?**
   - Efficient solutions should be favored, preferably better than `O(n^2)` time complexity.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Length:**
   - Use binary search to determine the length of the longest duplicate substring. The search space for lengths will be between 1 and `n-1`.

2. **Rabin-Karp for Duplicate Detection:**
   - For each length determined by binary search, use the Rabin-Karp algorithm to check for duplicate substrings. This involves:
     - Hashing each substring of the current length.
     - Using a rolling hash to efficiently update the hash when sliding the window to the next substring.
     - Using a hash set to track previously seen hashes to detect duplicates.

### Code

Here's an implementation:

```javascript
function longestDupSubstring(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const MOD = 2**63 - 1;

    // Utility function for Rabin-Karp's rolling hash
    function rabinKarp(len) {
        const base = 256;
        let hash = 0;
        let baseL = 1; // base^len % MOD
        for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            hash = (hash * base + s.charCodeAt(i)) % MOD;
            if (i < len - 1) {
                baseL = (baseL * base) % MOD;
            }
        }
        const seen = new Set();
        seen.add(hash);
        for (let i = len; i < n; i++) {
            hash = (hash * base + s.charCodeAt(i) - s.charCodeAt(i - len) * baseL) % MOD;
            if (hash < 0) { 
                hash += MOD;
            }
            if (seen.has(hash)) {
                return i - len + 1;
            }
            seen.add(hash);
        }
        return -1;
    }

    let low = 1, high = n - 1;
    let start = -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        const idx = rabinKarp(mid);
        if (idx != -1) {
            start = idx;
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return start == -1 ? '' : s.substring(start, start + low - 1);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** `O(log n)`
- **Rabin-Karp Hashing:**
  - Each substring of length `L` takes `O(L)` to compute initial hash and `O(1)` for rolling hash updates.
  - There are `O(n-L)` substrings to hash, hence `O(n)`.
- Overall time complexity involves binary search and hashing steps combined: `O(n log n)`.

This solution leverages efficiency through a combination of binary search and Rabin-Karp algorithm to find the longest duplicate substring in the input string.
