[Leetcode 3096. Minimum Levels to Gain More Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3096)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `levels`, where each `levels[i] = [enemy_i, point_i]`. `enemy_i` indicates the number of enemies in the i-th level, and `point_i` indicates the number of points you can gain after completing the i-th level.

Initially, you have `initialPoints` points. You need at least the given number of points to start each level. If you do not have enough points to start a certain level, you skip it.

Return the minimum number of levels you must complete to reach or exceed `requiredPoints`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: levels = [[5, 10], [3, 5], [10, 20]], initialPoints = 10, requiredPoints = 20
Output: 2
Explanation: You can complete the first and second levels to get at least 20 points.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can levels be completed in any order?
2. Is there a guarantee that all levels are unique by enemy and points?
3. Is it guaranteed that it is always possible to reach the requiredPoints using the provided levels?

Once we've clarified these questions, we can proceed to strategy and code.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting Levels**: As we need to reach a minimum required points efficiently, it might make sense to sort levels based on the points you get for the required points to start them.
2. **Greedy Completion**: Attempt to complete as many levels as possible starting from the highest point yield to efficiently reach the `requiredPoints`.

### Plan
1. Sort the levels based on `point_i` in descending order.
2. Initialize `currentPoints` with `initialPoints`.
3. Traverse through the sorted levels and complete the level if `currentPoints` are greater than or equal to `enemy_i`.
4. Track and return the count of levels completed once we reach or exceed the `requiredPoints`.

## Code
```javascript
function minLevelsToGainMorePoints(levels, initialPoints, requiredPoints) {
    // Sort levels by point_i in descending order
    levels.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

    let currentPoints = initialPoints;
    let completedLevels = 0;

    for (let [enemy_i, point_i] of levels) {
        if (currentPoints >= enemy_i) {
            completedLevels++;
            currentPoints += point_i;

            if (currentPoints >= requiredPoints) {
                return completedLevels;
            }
        }
    }

    // Return -1 if couldn't reach requiredPoints
    return -1;
}

// Example Usage
let levels = [[5, 10], [3, 5], [10, 20]];
let initialPoints = 10;
let requiredPoints = 20;
console.log(minLevelsToGainMorePoints(levels, initialPoints, requiredPoints)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of levels.
- **Traversal**: O(n) for traversing the levels.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
