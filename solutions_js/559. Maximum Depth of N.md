[Leetcode 559. Maximum Depth of N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l559)
### Problem Statement

The problem can be found on LeetCode as problem 559: "Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an n-ary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

N-ary tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples for better understanding).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the tree be empty?
   **A:** Yes, and in such a case the depth should be 0.

2. **Q:** Are node values always positive integers or can they include negative integers and zero?
   **A:** Node values can be any integer, but for this problem, node values are irrelevant since we are only interested in the structure of the tree.

3. **Q:** Should the input always be well-formed?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume the input to the function will always be a well-formed N-ary tree.

### Strategy

We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve this problem. The strategy involves:

1. **DFS Approach:**
   - If the root is `null`, return 0 as the depth.
   - Initialize the max depth to 0.
   - Use a recursive function to traverse each node. For each node, call the recursive function on each of its children.
   - Track the depth while traversing, and update the maximum depth accordingly.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**
   - Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
   - Increment the depth count for each level processed.

In this case, we'll go with the DFS strategy for clarity.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a Node.
function Node(val, children) {
    this.val = val;
    this.children = children;
};

var maxDepth = function(root) {
    if (root === null) return 0;
    
    let maxDepth = 0;
   
    // Depth-First Search through the tree
    function dfs(node, currentDepth) {
        if (node === null) return;
        
        maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, currentDepth);
        
        for (let child of node.children) {
            dfs(child, currentDepth + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Initiate DFS from root
    dfs(root, 1);
    
    return maxDepth;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(N)** where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the worst case, we need to visit every node exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(d)** where `d` is the maximum depth of the tree. This is because the space needed on the call stack in the worst case will be equal to the depth of the tree (due to recursion).
