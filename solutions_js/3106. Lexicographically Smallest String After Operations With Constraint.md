[Leetcode 3106. Lexicographically Smallest String After Operations With Constraint](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3106)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of even length consisting of digits from `0` to `9`, where `s` is a representation of a number. You are also given two integers `a` and `b`. You can choose to perform either of the following operations any number of times and in any order on `s`:

1. Add `a` to all odd-indexed digits of `s` (0-indexed). Digits are within the range `0-9`, so after adding `a` to a digit, if the result is greater than `9`, the digit is incremented by the result mod `10`.
2. Rotate the string `s` to the right by `b` positions.

Your objective is to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by applying the above operations any number of times on `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the input string `s` will always be valid and of even length?
   - Yes, we'll always receive a valid input string with an even length.
   
2. Can `b` be greater than the length of the string?
   - Yes, but a rotation by `b` is equivalent to a rotation by `b % length of s`.

## Strategy

1. **Rotation Normalization**: Since rotating by `b` is identical after every `s.length` rotations, we can reduce the rotation by `b % s.length`.
2. **Odd-Indexed Increment**: We need to consider mod 10 sums for the odd indexed positions.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This can help us find the smallest lexicographical string. The BFS will explore all possible states created by the operations.

## Code

```javascript
const lexicographicallySmallestString = (s, a, b) => {
    const n = s.length;
    let queue = [s];
    let visited = new Set([s]);
    let smallest = s;

    const addAOperation = (str) => {
        let charArray = str.split('');
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
            charArray[i] = (parseInt(charArray[i]) + a) % 10 + '';
        }
        return charArray.join('');
    };

    const rotateOperation = (str) => {
        return str.slice(n - b) + str.slice(0, n - b);
    };

    while (queue.length) {
        let current = queue.shift();

        if (current < smallest) {
            smallest = current;
        }

        let addA = addAOperation(current);
        if (!visited.has(addA)) {
            visited.add(addA);
            queue.push(addA);
        }

        let rotate = rotateOperation(current);
        if (!visited.has(rotate)) {
            visited.add(rotate);
            queue.push(rotate);
        }
    }

    return smallest;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS will explore each possible state, but the number of unique states can be significantly large due to rotations and additions.
- **Operations**:
  - Rotation: O(n)
  - Addition: O(n)
- The algorithm runs BFS over possibly `10^n * n!` states, which is generally very large. However, due to pruning with visited states, the actual number explored is expected to be much fewer.

Thus, a precise worst-case time complexity is difficult to anticipate but can be expected to be exponential in nature due to the comprehensive state exploration using BFS.
