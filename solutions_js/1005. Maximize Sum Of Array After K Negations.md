[Leetcode 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1005)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you must apply exactly `k` operations where you can negate the value of any one integer in the array. Your goal is to maximize the sum of the array after applying exactly `k` operations.

Return the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` negations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `k` be zero?
   - **A**: Yes, `k` can be zero, meaning no operations will be performed.
   
2. **Q**: Can elements of `nums` be negative?
   - **A**: Yes, elements in `nums` can be negative.
   
3. **Q**: Can the array contain zero?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain zero.
   
4. **Q**: What should be the range of `k` and the size of `nums`?
   - **A**: Generally, both `k` and the size of `nums` will be positive integers up to `10^4`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Begin by sorting the array. This will help us easily access the smallest (most negative) values.
2. **Negate the Most Negative Values**: Iterate through the sorted array and negate the most negative values while `k` is greater than zero.
3. **Handle Remaining `k`**: If `k` is still greater than zero after the first pass, toggling the smallest element multiple times is the optimal strategy because toggling twice is equivalent to no change. Therefore, if `k` is odd, simply negate the smallest element in the sorted array.

### Time Complexity

The dominant operation is sorting the array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The subsequent iteration and possible single toggling of an element are linear, O(n). 

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Code

```javascript
var largestSumAfterKNegations = function(nums, k) {
    // First, sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Negate the most negative values
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length && k > 0; i++) {
        if (nums[i] < 0) {
            nums[i] = -nums[i];
            k--;
        }
    }
    
    // If k is still greater than 0, toggle the smallest element `k` times
    if (k > 0 && k % 2 == 1) {
        nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Re-sort to find the smallest element
        nums[0] = -nums[0];
    }
    
    // Return the sum of the array
    return nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**: We start by sorting the array in ascending order to ensure we have easy access to the smallest (most negative) values.
2. **Negate Values**: Iterate through the sorted array, negating the values until `k` operations are exhausted or until no more negative values are left.
3. **Check Remaining `k`**: If `k` is still greater than zero, re-evaluate the smallest element in the array:
   - If `k` is odd, negate the smallest element (since negating it an odd number of times will result in a net negation).
4. **Sum the Array**: Sum all elements of the modified array and return the result.

This ensures we achieve the maximum possible sum after `k` negations.
