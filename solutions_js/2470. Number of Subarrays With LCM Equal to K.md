[Leetcode 2470. Number of Subarrays With LCM Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2470)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of subarrays of `nums` where the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the subarrayâ€™s elements is equal to `k`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the values in `nums` and `k`?
   - Assume the values in `nums` and `k` are positive integers, and the length of `nums` is reasonable with respect to performance considerations.

2. **Output**: The output should be a single integer representing the count of subarrays whose LCM equals `k`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Use a nested loop to generate all possible subarrays and calculate their LCM. This approach is clear but may not be performant for larger arrays.
  
2. **LCM Calculation**: We will need a helper function to calculate the LCM of two numbers using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). The formula is:
   \[
   \text{{LCM}}(a, b) = \frac{{|a \times b|}}{{\text{{GCD}}(a, b)}}
   \]
   
3. **Optimization**: Given the constraints, focus on optimizing LCM calculations and pruning unnecessary calculations early.

## Code

Let's write a helper function for GCD and LCM first and then implement the main logic.

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
  while (b !== 0) {
    let temp = b;
    b = a % b;
    a = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

function lcm(a, b) {
  return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

function subarraysWithLCMEqualToK(nums, k) {
  let count = 0;
  const n = nums.length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let currentLCM = nums[i];
    
    if (currentLCM === k) {
      count++;
    }
    
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      currentLCM = lcm(currentLCM, nums[j]);
      
      if (currentLCM === k) {
        count++;
      }
      
      if (currentLCM > k) {
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  return count;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **GCD Function**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
2. **LCM Function**: Utilizes the GCD to calculate the least common multiple.
3. **Main Function**: Iterates over each possible subarray:
   - Initialize `currentLCM` with the first element of the subarray.
   - For each new element in the subarray, update `currentLCM`.
   - If `currentLCM` equals `k`, increment the count.
   - If `currentLCM` exceeds `k`, break the inner loop early since further elements will only increase `currentLCM`.

## Time Complexity
- **Worst-case time complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
  - Calculating LCM for each pair is constant time, but the nested loops make it quadratic.
- This is feasible for small to moderately-sized arrays but may need additional optimizations or alternative algorithms to handle very large arrays efficiently.
