[Leetcode 850. Rectangle Area II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l850)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of `rectangles` represented by a list of lists, where each sub-list contains 4 integers `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, which represent the bottom-left and top-right corners of a rectangle on a 2D plane.

Your task is to compute the total area covered by all `rectangles` in the plane. Any area that overlaps between rectangles should only be counted once.

**Example:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[0, 0, 2, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3], [1, 0, 3, 1]]
Output: 6
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
- `rectangles[i].length == 4`
- `-10^9 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^9`
- `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the output be an integer even if the area is a floating point number?
    - Since the coordinates given are integers and the area required is covered by rectangles (having integer coordinates), the result will naturally be an integer.
2. Can there be negative coordinates for x and y?
   - Yes, since the coordinates range is given as `-10^9` to `10^9`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of **sweep line algorithm** along with **event sorting** to compute the area efficiently. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Event Generation:**
   - For each rectangle, generate two events: one for the opening of the rectangle and another for the closing.

2. **Sorting Events:**
   - Sort these events first by the x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, sort them by the type (opening should come before closing).

3. **Line Sweep:**
   - Sweep a vertical line across the plane from left to right, processing events in order of x-coordinate.

4. **Active Intervals:**
   - For each unique x-coordinate, maintain a list of active y-intervals that represent the currently active rectangles.

5. **Compute Covered Area:**
   - As the sweep line progresses, update the total area covered based on the active intervals list.

6. **Implementation:**
   - Implement this strategy considering edge cases (e.g., overlapping rectangles).

Now moving to the implementation part:

## Code

```javascript
const rectangleArea = (rectangles) => {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    
    let events = [];
    rectangles.forEach(([x1, y1, x2, y2]) => {
        events.push([x1, y1, y2, 1]);
        events.push([x2, y1, y2, -1]);
    });

    // Sort events: primary by x coordinate, secondary by the rectangle type
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[3] - b[3]);
    
    let y_sweep = [];
    let lastX = events[0][0];
    let totalArea = 0;
    
    for (const [x, y1, y2, type] of events) {
        let width = x - lastX;
        
        let height = 0;
        let prevY = -1;
        let openCount = 0;
        
        for (const [sy1, sy2] of y_sweep) {
            sy1 = Math.max(sy1, prevY);
            if (sy1 < sy2) {
                height += sy2 - sy1;
                prevY = sy2;
            }
        }
        
        totalArea = (totalArea + width * height) % MOD;
        
        if (type === 1) {
            y_sweep.push([y1, y2]);
            y_sweep.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
        } else {
            for (let i = 0; i < y_sweep.length; ++i) {
                if (y_sweep[i][0] === y1 && y_sweep[i][1] === y2) {
                    y_sweep.splice(i, 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        lastX = x;
    }
    
    return totalArea;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting events**: \(O(N \log N)\) where \(N\) is the number of rectangles, leading to \(2N\) events.
- **Processing events**: Each event is processed in linear time, and managing the active intervals involves insertion and deletion, each \(O(N)\) in the worst case scenario.

Therefore, the overall complexity is:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \log N + N^2)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for storing events and active intervals.

This algorithm should handle the input constraints efficiently.
