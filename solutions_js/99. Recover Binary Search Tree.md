[Leetcode 99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l99)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Example:

```plaintext
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation:
  1
 / 
3
 \
  2

The binary search tree where we swapped 1 and 3 to make it invalid (now, you should recover the tree to be a BST).

Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation:
  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

The binary search tree where we swapped 2 and 3 to make it invalid (now, you should recover the tree to be a BST).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input tree have duplicate values?**
   - No, a valid BST cannot have duplicate values.

2. **What should be the return type?**
   - The tree should be modified in place, so there is no need to return the tree.

3. **What is the maximum height of the tree?**
   - The maximum height (or depth) would depend on constraints typically provided by LeetCode problems which is not specified here but we can assume reasonable limits for this scenario.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use an in-order traversal of the tree to detect the two nodes that were swapped by mistake. The idea is that in in-order traversal of a BST, the node values should appear in ascending order.

1. **In-order Traversal**: Perform in-order traversal on the tree to detect the two nodes which violate the BST property.
  
2. **Identify the nodes**: During the traversal, identify the two nodes which are out of order. Usually, there will be two violations if you swap two nodes:
   - The first occurrence where the previous node has a greater value than the current node (first violation).
   - The second occurrence where the previous node again has a greater value than the current node (second violation).

3. **Swap the nodes**: Once identified, swap the values of the two nodes to correct the BST.

4. **Modifications are in-place**: No need to create additional structures; just modify the tree nodes directly.

## Code

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
  this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
  this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
  this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
}

var recoverTree = function(root) {
  let firstElement = null;
  let secondElement = null;
  let prevElement = new TreeNode(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY);

  const inorderTraversal = (node) => {
    if (!node) return;

    inorderTraversal(node.left);

    // Start identifying the swapped nodes
    if (firstElement === null && prevElement.val >= node.val) {
      firstElement = prevElement;
    }
    if (firstElement !== null && prevElement.val >= node.val) {
      secondElement = node;
    }

    prevElement = node;

    inorderTraversal(node.right);
  };

  inorderTraversal(root);

  // Swap the values of the first and second elements
  const temp = firstElement.val;
  firstElement.val = secondElement.val;
  secondElement.val = temp;
};

```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary search tree. This is because we traverse each node exactly once during the in-order traversal.

The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack during the in-order traversal. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), this could be **O(n)**; for a balanced tree, it would be **O(log n)**.
