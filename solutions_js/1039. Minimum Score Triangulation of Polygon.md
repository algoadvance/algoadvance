[Leetcode 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1039)
## Problem Statement

You are given a convex polygon with `n` vertices. You are tasked to triangulate this polygon into `n - 2` triangles such that the sum of the score of these triangles is minimized. The score of a triangle (i, j, k) is defined as `values[i] * values[j] * values[k]`, where `values` is an array of integers representing the vertices of the polygon in clockwise order.

Return the minimum possible score that you can achieve by triangulating the polygon.

**Example:**
```
Input: values = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already a triangle, so the only possible triangulation is itself, with the score 1*2*3 = 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will the vertices in the `values` array always be in clockwise order?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the array represents the vertices in clockwise order.
   
2. What is the range of the array length `n`?
   - As per problem constraints, `3 <= n <= 50`.
   
3. What is the range of values in the array?
   - Each integer in the array is between `1` and `100`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). Here’s the detailed strategy:

1. **Initialization & Definition:**
    - Let's create a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum score to triangulate the sub-polygon starting at vertex `i` and ending at vertex `j`.
    - If `i` and `j` are consecutive vertices (or the same), no triangles can be formed, so `dp[i][j] = 0`.
  
2. **Filling DP Table:**
    - Iterate over all possible sub-polygon lengths.
    - For each sub-polygon, try every possible point `k` (where `i < k < j`) to form a triangle with vertices `(i, k, j)`.
    - Update `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of its current value and the score derived from the triangle `(i, k, j)` plus the triangulation score of sub-polygons `dp[i][k]` and `dp[k][j]`.

3. **Result Extraction:**
    - The result for the entire polygon will be in `dp[0][n-1]`.

With this in mind, let’s implement the solution.

## Code

```javascript
function minScoreTriangulation(values) {
    const n = values.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    for (let length = 2; length < n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n - length; i++) {
            const j = i + length;
            dp[i][j] = Infinity;
            for (let k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i][j], 
                    dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k]
                );
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n - 1];
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minScoreTriangulation([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is O(n^3) due to the three nested loops:
  - The outer loop for the lengths of the sub-polygons: O(n).
  - The second loop for the starting point of the sub-polygon: O(n).
  - The innermost loop for choosing the vertex `k`: O(n).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^3).

This algorithm efficiently computes the minimum score for triangulating the polygon given the constraints.
