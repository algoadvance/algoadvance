[Leetcode 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l230)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the `k`th smallest element in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `k` and the values within the nodes?
   - Is `k` guaranteed to be a valid index (can we assume that `k` will always be between `1` and the number of nodes in the BST)?

2. **Tree Properties:**
   - Can the BST contain duplicate values, or are all values unique?
   
3. **Tree Structure:**
   - What should be returned if the tree is empty (though implicit from the initial prompt)?

### Strategy

Given that it’s a Binary Search Tree (BST), the smallest element can be found using in-order traversal, {left, root, right}. This means we need to traverse the tree in an in-order manner and count the nodes until we reach the `k`th node. The in-order traversal of a BST naturally visits nodes in ascending order.

1. **In-Order Traversal:**
   - Perform an in-order traversal to reach the `k`th smallest element.
   - Keep a counter to track the number of nodes visited.

2. **Recursion or Iterative Approach:**
   - Both approaches are viable—recursive if simplicity is preferred, iterative if stack manipulation is a concern.

I'll illustrate the iterative approach here for its practical handling of larger trees without hitting stack overflow issues for deep trees.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

const kthSmallest = (root, k) => {
    const stack = [];
    let current = root, count = 0;

    while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }
        
        current = stack.pop();
        count += 1;
        
        if (count === k) {
            return current.val;
        }
        
        current = current.right;
    }

    return null; // Should never reach here due to problem constraints
};

// Example Usage:
// Let's create a simple BST: 3, 1, 4, null, 2

const root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(1);
root.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);

console.log(kthSmallest(root, 1)); // Output: 1
console.log(kthSmallest(root, 2)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we might need to visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case scenario (unbalanced tree), the height H could be N, leading to O(N) space complexity due to the stack storage. For a balanced tree, this would be O(log N).
