[Leetcode 1646. Get Maximum in Generated Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1646)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to generate an array based on specific rules and then find the maximum value in that array. Here is what the prompt specifies:

You are given an integer `n`. A zero-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n + 1` is generated based on the following rules:

- `nums[0] = 0`
- `nums[1] = 1`
- For `2 <= i <= n`, `nums[i] = nums[i / 2]` if `i` is even.
- For `2 <= i <= n`, `nums[i] = nums[i // 2] + nums[i // 2 + 1]` if `i` is odd.

Return the maximum integer in the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the minimum value for `n`?
   - The minimum value for `n` is 0.
   
2. What should the output be for edge cases like `n = 0`?
   - For `n = 0`, the array would be `[0]` and the maximum should be 0.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an array `nums` with a size of `n + 1` and set `nums[0] = 0`.
2. If `n` is greater than 0, set `nums[1] = 1`.
3. Loop through the array from index 2 to `n`:
   - If the index `i` is even, set `nums[i] = nums[i / 2]`.
   - If the index `i` is odd, set `nums[i] = nums[(i - 1) / 2] + nums[(i - 1) / 2 + 1]`.
4. Find the maximum value in the generated array and return it.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` because we iterate through the array once.
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` because we store the values in an array of size `n + 1`.

### Code

```javascript
var getMaximumGenerated = function(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1; // Special cases

    const nums = new Array(n + 1);
    nums[0] = 0;
    nums[1] = 1;

    let maxVal = 1;

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            nums[i] = nums[i / 2];
        } else {
            nums[i] = nums[(i - 1) / 2] + nums[(i - 1) / 2 + 1];
        }
        maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, nums[i]);
    }
    
    return maxVal;
};
```

This code will generate the array based on the given rules and then identify the maximum value efficiently.
