[Leetcode 1313. Decompress Run](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1313)
### Problem Statement

Given a list, `nums`, of integers in a run-length encoded format, return the decompressed version of the list.

In a run-length encoded list, each pair of elements [frequency, value] means that the `value` should appear in the decompressed list `frequency` times.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The data is interpreted as [frequency, value] pairs: (1, 2) and (3, 4). Therefore, the decompressed list is [2, 4, 4, 4].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Confirming the input structure:**
   - Is `nums` always going to have an even number of elements?
   - Are the integers in `nums` always non-negative?
   
2. **Constraints on input values:**
   - Are there any constraints on the values of frequency and value?
   - What should be the behavior if the frequency is zero?
  
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if `nums` is an empty list?

Assuming from the example that:
- The list `nums` must indeed have an even number of elements.
- The values are non-negative integers.
- Zero frequencies would result in no values added for that pair.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list to store the decompressed values.
2. Iterate over the `nums` list in steps of 2.
3. For each pair, append the value `frequency` times to the result list.
4. Return the final decompressed list.

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves iterating over the `nums` list once which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- Additionally, we are appending elements multiple times, which, in the worst case where all frequencies are 1, would be linear with respect to the total number of values generated.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m) where m is the length of the decompressed list.

### Code

```javascript
function decompressRLElist(nums) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
        const frequency = nums[i];
        const value = nums[i + 1];
        for (let j = 0; j < frequency; j++) {
            result.push(value);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(decompressRLElist(nums)); // Output: [2, 4, 4, 4]
```

This code initializes an empty array, then iterates through the input list in steps of 2, using a nested loop to add the value to the result array `frequency` times. Finally, it returns the resultant decompressed list.
