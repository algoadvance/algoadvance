[Leetcode 880. Decoded String at Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l880)
### Problem Statement

You are given an encoded string `s`. To decode the string to a sequence of characters, follow this algorithm:

1. Start with an empty string `result = ""`.
2. For each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is a digit from 2 to 9, repeat the current `result` `digit` times and assign it back to `result`.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to `result`.

You are also given an integer `k`. Find the `k-th` character (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints of the input string `s` and the integer `k`?
   - **A:** The string `s` will have a length between 1 and 100, and it will include only lowercase English letters and digits from 2 to 9. The integer `k` will always be a valid index within the length of the decoded string.

2. **Q:** Is it necessary to decode the entire string to find the k-th character?
   - **A:** It may not be feasible to decode the entire string due to space and time constraints. We need to derive a method that can locate the k-th character efficiently.

### Strategy

To efficiently determine the k-th character without fully decoding the string, we'll take the following approach:

1. **Calculate the length**: Determine the length of the decoded string using a virtual decoding process.
2. **Traceback to find k-th character**: Once the full length is determined, trace backwards from k to find the k-th character.

1. **Calculate the length**: 
   - Traverse the string to calculate the length of the decoded string. Keep a variable `decoded_length` to store the current length.
   
2. **Traceback to find k-th character**:
   - Start from the end of the string and move backwards. Adjust `k` based on whether the current character is a letter or a digit. Use the running length (`decoded_length`) to decide when the k-th character is found.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function decodeAtIndex(s, k) {
    let decoded_length = 0;

    // Calculate the length of the decoded string
    for (const char of s) {
        if (isDigit(char)) {
            decoded_length *= parseInt(char);
        } else {
            decoded_length += 1;
        }
    }

    // Trace back to find the k-th character
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const char = s[i];
        k %= decoded_length;

        if (k === 0 && isLetter(char)) {
            return char;
        }

        if (isDigit(char)) {
            decoded_length /= parseInt(char);
        } else {
            decoded_length -= 1;
        }
    }
}

function isDigit(char) {
    return '2' <= char && char <= '9';
}

function isLetter(char) {
    return 'a' <= char && char <= 'z';
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. The main operations—calculating the decoded length and tracing back to find the k-th character—each take linear time.

This approach ensures that we do not need to explicitly decode the entire string, thus optimizing both time and space complexity.
