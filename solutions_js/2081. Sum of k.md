[Leetcode 2081. Sum of k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2081)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `k` and `n`, your task is to find the sum of the first `n` positive `k`-mirror numbers. A `k`-mirror number is a number that is a palindrome in both base-10 and base-k.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the integers `k` and `n`?**
   - Both `k` and `n` are positive integers, and `k` can be between 2 and 10, while `n` can be a large number within feasible computational limits.

2. **What is the base of the input numbers?**
   - All input numbers `k` and `n` are given in base-10.

3. **Are we to consider only positive integers for k-mirror numbers?**
   - Yes, only positive integers should be considered.

4. **Palindromes are read the same forward and backward—is this the correct definition?**
   - Yes, a number is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward in the respective base.

## Strategy

1. **Helper Function - Convert to Base `k`:**
   - Write a function to convert a number from base-10 to base-`k`.

2. **Helper Function - Check Palindrome:**
   - Write a function to check if a number (in any base representation, represented as a string) is a palindrome.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - Iterate through positive integers to find the first `n` numbers that are palindromic in both base-10 and base-`k`.
   - Use the helper functions to check the palindrome condition in both representations.

4. **Terminate when `n` k-mirror numbers are found and return their sum.**

## Code

```javascript
function isPalindrome(s) {
    return s === s.split('').reverse().join('');
}

function toBaseK(num, k) {
    let result = '';
    while (num > 0) {
        result = (num % k).toString() + result;
        num = Math.floor(num / k);
    }
    return result;
}

function sumOfKMirrorNumbers(k, n) {
    let sum = 0;
    let found = 0;
    let num = 1;

    while (found < n) {
        let str10 = num.toString();
        let strK = toBaseK(num, k);

        if (isPalindrome(str10) && isPalindrome(strK)) {
            sum += num;
            found++;
        }

        num++;
    }

    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sumOfKMirrorNumbers(2, 5)); // Example output
```

## Time Complexity

- **Base Conversion Function (`toBaseK`)**: The time complexity is O(logₖ(n)) for each number `n`. This is because dividing a number by `k` reduces the number of digits logarithmically.
- **Palindrome Check Function (`isPalindrome`)**: Checking if a string of length `d` is a palindrome takes O(d) time.

- **Main Loop Execution**:
  - In the worst-case scenario, the combined complexity of checking up to `n` valid `k`-mirror numbers would involve iterating through numbers and checking each number on average. 
  - Let’s assume checking each candidate number roughly involves O(logₖ(N) + d), giving us a worst-case complexity around O(n \* (logₖ(N) + d)), with `N` being the numbers evaluated before finding the `n` k-mirror numbers and `d` being the max digits involved.

This approach is efficient as long as `n` isn’t excessively large, and `k` is relatively small. 

This should give a workable and practical solution for the given problem constraints.
