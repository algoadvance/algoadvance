[Leetcode 2440. Create Components With Same Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2440)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[i]` denotes the value of the `i`-th node.

You need to find the minimum number of `edges` you can remove from the tree to obtain the correct number of components such that every component's values sum is equal. Return this minimum number of edges to be removed. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,1,1,2], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Remove edges [0,3] and [3,4] to form three components [0,1,2], [3], [4] with sums 4, 1, 2 respectively.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative values?
2. Can the input graph ever be disconnected?
3. Are the components required to have exactly the same sum or can they just be any factors of the total sum?
4. Is it possible for the `nums` array to be empty?

### Strategy
1. **Total Sum Calculation**: First, calculate the total sum of values in the `nums` array. If this total sum cannot be divided evenly by any integer greater than 1, return `-1`, as it's impossible to split it into multiple components with equal sums.
2. **Possible Component Sum**: Identify possible sums for the components by iterating through the divisors of the total sum.
3. **DFS for Valid Splits**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to check if it’s possible to split the tree into components with the identified sum.
4. **Edge Removal Tracking**: Count and track the number of edges that need to be removed to achieve the splits.

### Time Complexity
- **DFS Traversal**: O(n)
- **Divisor Calculation**: O(√TotalSum)

### Code Implementation
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const dfs = (node, parent, target, graph, nums, subTreeSum) => {
    let currentSum = nums[node];
    
    for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
        if (neighbor !== parent) {
            currentSum += dfs(neighbor, node, target, graph, nums, subTreeSum);
        }
    }
    
    // If the current sum of the subtree rooted at 'node' equals the target component sum,
    // this subtree can form a valid component, and its sum is effectively "removed" from the tree.
    if (currentSum === target) {
        subTreeSum.push(currentSum);
        return 0;
    }
    
    return currentSum;
};

const componentsWithEqualSum = (nums, edges) => {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    const n = nums.length;
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }
    
    for (let divisor = 2; divisor <= totalSum; ++divisor) {
        if (totalSum % divisor === 0) {
            const targetComponentSum = totalSum / divisor;
            const subTreeSum = [];
            
            dfs(0, -1, targetComponentSum, graph, nums, subTreeSum);
            
            if (subTreeSum.length === divisor) {
                return edges.length - (divisor - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2];
const edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [3, 4]];
console.log(componentsWithEqualSum(nums, edges)); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Construction**: Build an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Iterate Divisors**: Check every possible divisor of the total sum.
3. **DFS Traversal**: Perform DFS to compute sums for subtrees and check if equal sum components can be formed.
4. **Edge Counting**: Calculate the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to achieve the splits, if possible.

This approach ensures that we correctly and efficiently determine the valid splits and track the required edge removals.
