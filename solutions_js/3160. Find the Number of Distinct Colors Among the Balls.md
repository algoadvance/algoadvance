[Leetcode 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3160)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `colors` where each string represents the color of a ball. Your task is to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Can the array be empty, and if so, what should the output be?
    - Are the color strings case-sensitive?
    
2. **Output**:
    - Should the output be an integer representing the count of distinct colors?

### Code

```javascript
function countDistinctColors(colors) {
    // Use a Set to store distinct colors
    let distinctColors = new Set();

    for (let color of colors) {
        distinctColors.add(color);
    }

    // Return the size of the Set, representing the number of distinct colors
    return distinctColors.size;
}

// Example Usage:
let colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(countDistinctColors(colors)); // Output: 3
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Set Data Structure**:
    - A Set in JavaScript automatically handles duplicates, making it ideal for storing distinct elements.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
    - Loop through each element in the `colors` array and add it to the Set.

3. **Count Distinct Elements**:
    - The size of the Set will give us the number of distinct colors.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `colors` array. This is because we need to iterate through the array once to add elements to the Set.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, if all colors are distinct, we store each color in the Set.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly count the distinct colors using the properties of the Set data structure.
