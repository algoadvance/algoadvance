[Leetcode 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1413)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You start with an initial positive value `startValue`.

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of `startValue` and `nums` (from left to right). The step by step sum is the result of summing `startValue` with all elements in `nums` iteratively.

Return the minimum positive value of `startValue` such that the step by step sum is always greater than 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the elements of the `nums` array be negative?
   **A:** Yes, the elements of the `nums` array can be negative, positive, or zero.

2. **Q:** Can `nums` be an empty array?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that `nums` is a non-empty array.

3. **Q:** What is the expected output if `nums` array already has step by step sum greater than 0 even with initial `startValue` as 1?
   **A:** The expected output would still be 1, as we seek the minimum positive `startValue`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Let's start with a `startValue` of 1 since the problem statement requires a positive value.
2. **Iterate through `nums`:** Keep track of the cumulative sum as you iterate through the array.
3. **Check Step by Step Sum:** During iteration, ensure that the current step by step sum (initial value plus elements in `nums` so far) remains positive.
4. **Adjust `startValue`:** If at any point the step by step sum would become non-positive, adjust `startValue` upwards.
5. **Output Result:** The smallest `startValue` such that the sum remains positive throughout the iteration is our solution.

### Code

```javascript
var minStartValue = function(nums) {
    let minStartValue = 1; // Initialize to the smallest positive integer.
    let currentSum = 0; // This will track the cumulative sum.

    // We need to find the minimal start value so that all step sums are positive
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Compute the hypothetical cumulative sum from the start value
        currentSum += nums[i];
        
        // If the cumulative sum falls below 1, we adjust the start value up
        if (currentSum < 1) {
            minStartValue += (1 - currentSum);
            currentSum = 1; // Reset current sum to reflect to a positive zone.
        }
    }
    
    return minStartValue;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating through the `nums` array once. The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Set `minStartValue` to `1` and `currentSum` to `0`.
2. **Iterate through `nums`:** 
   - Add each element of `nums` to `currentSum`.
   - Whenever `currentSum` falls below 1, adjust `minStartValue` by the necessary amount to ensure that the cumulative sum returns to at least 1.
3. **Return Result:** By the end of the loop, `minStartValue` holds the minimum value such that all step by step sums are positive, which we then return.

This approach guarantees that at any point in the iteration, cumulative sum remains positive by adjusting `minStartValue` accordingly.
