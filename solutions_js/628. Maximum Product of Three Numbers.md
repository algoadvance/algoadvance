[Leetcode 628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l628)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3]
Output: -6
```

**Constraints:**
- 3 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain both positive and negative numbers?**
   Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.
   
2. **Can the array have zeros?**
   Yes, the array can contain zeroes.

3. **Are there any restrictions on the size of the input array?**
   Yes, the length of the array will be at least 3 and at most 10^4, as given in the constraints.

4. **Do we need to return the values of the three numbers or just the maximum product?**
   We only need to return the maximum product.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting Approach:**
   - Sort the array in ascending order.
   - The maximum product of three numbers can come from either:
     - The product of the three largest numbers.
     - The product of the two smallest numbers (which can be negative to produce a positive product) and the largest number.
   - Return the maximum of these two products.

2. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Identify the maximum three numbers and the minimum two numbers using a single pass.
   - Compute and compare the product of the three largest numbers and the product of the two smallest numbers with the largest number.

In this solution, we'll go with the sorting approach for simplicity.

## Code

```javascript
var maximumProduct = function(nums) {
    // Sort the array to get ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Compute the product of the last three numbers
    let max1 = nums[nums.length - 1] * nums[nums.length - 2] * nums[nums.length - 3];
    // Compute the product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number
    let max2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[nums.length - 1];
    
    // Return the maximum of the two products
    return Math.max(max1, max2);
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the size of the array.
- **Comparison Time Complexity:** O(1) since it is a constant-time operation.

Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
