[Leetcode 910. Smallest Range II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l910)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. For each index `i` where `0 <= i < A.length`, we can choose to either add `K` to `A[i]` or subtract `K` from `A[i]`. The goal is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array after making those adjustments.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after performing these operations.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: A = [1, 3, 6], K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Change A to [4, 0, 3]. The maximum of A is 4, and the minimum is 0. Therefore, the answer is 4 - 1 = 3.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
- `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`
- `0 <= K <= 10000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements of the array be negative?**
    - No, per the constraints, elements in the array should be between `0` and `10000`.

2. **Is K guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?**
    - Yes, `K` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer as per the constraints.

3. **Can we assume that the input array can be empty?**
    - No, the input array will contain at least one element as per the constraints (`1 <= A.length`).

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**:
    - Sorting will help us intuitively understand the problem and easily track the min and max values.

2. **Consider the Range**:
    - After sorting, consider each point `i` in the array where we consider changing the first `i` elements to `-K` and the rest to `+K`.

3. **Compute the Difference**:
    - Calculate the potential new min and max values using the modifications described and track the smallest difference.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array `A`.
2. Initialize the initial min and max as `min_val = A[0]`, `max_val = A[n-1]` â€” where n is the length of the array.
3. Iterate through elements, choosing to balance addition and subtraction of `K`.
4. Track the minimum difference observed during this iteration.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity should be O(N log N) because sorting dominates the runtime. Handling new minimum and maximum calculations would be O(N).

## Code

```javascript
var smallestRangeII = function(A, K) {
    A.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let n = A.length;
    let minVal = A[0];
    let maxVal = A[n - 1];
    let result = maxVal - minVal;

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        let high = Math.max(maxVal - K, A[i] + K);
        let low = Math.min(minVal + K, A[i + 1] - K);
        result = Math.min(result, high - low);
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Explanation

- **Sorting the Array**: We sort the array to have a definite order to compare min and max after potential `K` operations.
- **Initial Setup**: Initialize `minVal` and `maxVal` using the extremes of the sorted list.
- **Iterating**: Iterate through and compute potential high and low values for each splitting point in the array.
- **Calculating Result**: Keep track of the smallest difference found.

This approach ensures that all possible scenarios (side adjustments with `+K` and `-K`) are considered, and we find the minimal range efficiently.
