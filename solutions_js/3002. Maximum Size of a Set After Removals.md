[Leetcode 3002. Maximum Size of a Set After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3002)
## Problem Statement

**Maximum Size of a Set After Removals**

Given an array `nums` of size `n` where nums[i] represents the element at the `i-th` index of the array, find the maximum size of a set after performing the following operation any number of times:

1. Choose an element from the set and remove it.

The operation means after removing the element, you should not re-add it into the set in further operations. However, the final number should keep the elements unique.

Return the maximum possible size of the set after performing the operation any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it necessary to remove at least one element, or can we return the original size of the set if no removals are optimal?
2. Are there any constraints regarding the values within `nums` (e.g., range of values)?
3. Are all elements in `nums` unique initially?
4. Is this problem defining a sequence or permutation where elements are removed in a certain manner?

## Code

Since the problem may still be slightly ambiguous, let's try to clarify a few points based on the assumptions. 

Assuming we need to maximize the size of the set by removing duplicates:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxUniqueSetSize(nums) {
    let uniqueSet = new Set(nums);
    return uniqueSet.size;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
console.log(maxUniqueSetSize(nums));  // Output: 5
```

## Strategy

1. **Convert to Set**: Since sets automatically handle uniqueness, converting `nums` to a set will remove any duplicate elements.
2. **Return Set Size**: The size of the resulting set represents the number of unique elements that remain after any number of removals.
3. This approach ensures we meet the requirement of maximizing the size of the set with all unique elements.

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: 
    - Converting an array to a set has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
    - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage of elements in the set.
