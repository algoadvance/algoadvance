[Leetcode 3086. Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3086)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one move, you can pick any `k` ones out and erase them from the array.

Return the minimum number of moves required to pick all the ones out of the array.

Note that you cannot erase fewer than `k` ones in a move.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
In the first move, we choose the first, fourth, and sixth ones. The array becomes [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Now, there is no one left.
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
In the first move, we choose all the ones in the array. Now, there is no one left.
```

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
We pick each one in three separate moves.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?** 
   No, the array will have at least one `1` if `k` is greater than 0.

2. **What if `k` is larger than the total number of `1`s in `nums`?**
   The problem implies that `k` will be chosen such that it can always be served with available `1`s in proper moves.

3. **Are there any bounds on the length of the array?**
   The length of the array can be assumed to be within typical constraints suitable for standard interview problems.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Positions of `1`s:**
    - Extract positions of `1`s from the array since we only need to keep track of `1`s for calculating minimum moves.

2. **Sliding Window or Windowed Sum Approach:**
    - Create windows of length `k` over the positions of `1`s and calculate the optimal position to pick `k` ones with minimal cost.
    - The cost can be computed using the distance between actual positions and their desired positions in an optimal scenario.

3. **Calculate Minimum Moves:**
    - For each window, calculate the distance each `1` has to move to form a block of `k` ones.
    - Sum these distances and keep track of the minimum sum found.

### Code

```javascript
function minMoves(nums, k) {
    const ones = [];
    
    // Collect the positions of `1` elements in the array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            ones.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Calculate prefix sums to optimize distance calculation
    const prefixSums = new Array(ones.length + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < ones.length; i++) {
        prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + ones[i];
    }

    let minMoves = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Find minimal move requirement for each window of size `k`
    for (let i = 0; i <= ones.length - k; i++) {
        const mid = i + k // 2;
        const median = ones[mid];
        // Calculate total cost to bring the window into a contiguous block
        const leftCost = median * (mid - i) - (prefixSums[mid] - prefixSums[i]);
        const rightCost = (prefixSums[i + k] - prefixSums[mid + 1]) - median * (i + k - mid - 1);
        const totalCost = leftCost + rightCost;
        
        minMoves = Math.min(minMoves, totalCost);
    }

    return minMoves;
}

// Test cases
console.log(minMoves([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 2)); // Output: 1
console.log(minMoves([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 3)); // Output: 1
console.log(minMoves([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 1)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array. The process involves two primary operations: creating the positions array and calculating the minimal moves, both of which are linear-time operations based on the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of `1`s in `nums`, primarily due to the `prefixSums` and `ones` arrays used to store intermediate positions and cumulative sums.
