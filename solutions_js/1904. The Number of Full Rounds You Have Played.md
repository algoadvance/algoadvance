[Leetcode 1904. The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1904)
### Problem Statement

You are working on a problem where you need to calculate the number of full rounds played in a game. Each round starts every 15 minutes starting from 00:00 (midnight), meaning the rounds start at 00:00, 00:15, 00:30, etc. Given the start and end times of the game, you need to calculate how many full 15-minute rounds have been completed.

The input is given as two time strings in the format `HH:MM`, representing the start and end times. The time provided may span across midnight; in such cases, the end time will be considered to be on the next day.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few details:
1. **Edge Cases:** What if the start and end times are the same? This would imply a single round starting and ending at the same time, and hence no full rounds within the 15-minute interval are completed.
2. **Input Constraints:** Can start and end times be guaranteed to be valid times? (Always within `00:00` to `23:59`)
3. **Other Time Ranges:** Is it possible for the game to run more than 24 hours?

For this solution, let's assume times are within a single 24-hour cycle (end time can be later on the next day but within the 24h context).

### Strategy

1. **Time Conversion:** Convert start and end times into minutes from midnight.
2. **Handling Midnight:** If the end time is less than the start time, add 24 hours (1440 minutes) to the end time to account for the game running past midnight.
3. **Round Boundaries:** Adjust the start time to the next closest 15-minute interval if necessary, and the end time to the last closest 15-minute interval.
4. **Compute Full Rounds:** Calculate the number of full 15-minute intervals between these adjusted times.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfRounds(startTime, finishTime) {
    // Helper function: Convert HH:MM to minutes from midnight
    const timeToMinutes = (time) => {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };
    
    let start = timeToMinutes(startTime);
    let end = timeToMinutes(finishTime);
    
    // Adjust for end time crossing midnight
    if (end < start) {
        end += 1440; // Add 24 hours in minutes
    }
    
    // Adjust start to the next 15-minute interval
    if (start % 15 !== 0) {
        start += (15 - start % 15);
    }
    
    // Adjust end to the last previous 15-minute interval
    end = end - (end % 15);
    
    // Calculate full 15-minute rounds
    const fullRounds = Math.max(0, (end - start) / 15);
    
    return fullRounds;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution involves only a constant number of operations:
1. Converting times into minutes.
2. Adjusting for crossings of midnight.
3. Calculating the next and previous 15-minute intervals.
4. Determining the number of full intervals.

**Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - constant time operations. The approach is efficient in both time and space through direct arithmetic operations.

This function should correctly handle all given edge cases and constraints of the problem.
