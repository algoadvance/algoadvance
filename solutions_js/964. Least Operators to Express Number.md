[Leetcode 964. Least Operators to Express Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l964)
### Problem Statement
Given a single positive integer `x` and a target number `target`, you need to find the least number of operators to express the `target` as an arithmetic expression using only the integer `x` and the operators "add", "subtract", "multiply", and "divide".

- The integer `x` can be used as many times as necessary.
- You can only use the four operators: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and true division (`/`).
- Each operator must be applied to at least one more instance of `x`.
- You cannot use parenthesis.

Return the least number of operations needed to express the target with the given rules.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - `x` and `target` are both positive integers.
    - `1 <= x <= 100`
    - `1 <= target <= 10^9`
    
2. **Operators Precision:**
    - Since operations are on integers, division must be integer division.

3. **Is it possible to use pre-built functions or modules?**
    - Standard JavaScript math functions can be used, but the solution must be implemented manually without libraries that solve the problem directly.

### Strategy
The strategy to solve this problem revolves around dynamic programming and greedy exploration of different arithmetic expressions:

1. **Exploring Powers of x:**
   - Use powers of `x` to get close to the target.
2. **Recursive Calculation:**
   - Recursively compute the minimum operations needed by considering both `x^k` and the result of reducing the target modulo `x^k`.

### Code

Here's the code to implement the solution based on the identified strategy:

```javascript
function leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target) {
    if (target == 0) return 0;
    if (target < x) return Math.min(2 * target - 1, 2 * (x - target));
    
    let k = Math.floor(Math.log(target) / Math.log(x));
    let p = Math.pow(x, k);
    let dist1 = leastOpsExpressTarget(x, target - p) + k;
    let dist2 = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    
    if (p * x - target < target) {
        dist2 = leastOpsExpressTarget(x, p * x - target) + k + 1;
    }
    
    if (target == p) return k - 1;
    return Math.min(dist1, dist2);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(leastOpsExpressTarget(3, 19)); // Output: 5
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Cases:**
    - If `target` is 0, you don't need any operations.
    - If `target` is less than `x`, choose between adding or subtracting `x` to get close to the target.
2. **Iterative Case:**
    - Calculate the highest power of `x` (`x^k`) less than or equal to `target`.
    - Compute the distance to target from `x^k` and recursively call the function on the remainder.
    - Similarly, calculate the distance if you overshoot to the nearest power and reduce backward.
3. **Minimize Operations:**
    - Return the minimum operations required between the two scenarios (`dist1` and `dist2`).

### Time Complexity
The main complexity arises from recursively splitting the problem based on powers of `x`. Due to the nature of the recursive function and log operations, the expected complexity should beO(log x (target log target)), which balances the base and depth of recursive calls.

By following this structured approach, you ensure each step logically reduces the problem into smaller parts, eventually leading to the minimum number of operations required.
