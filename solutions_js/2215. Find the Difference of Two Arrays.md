[Leetcode 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2215)
## Problem Statement

There are two arrays: `nums1` and `nums2`. Find:
- All unique elements present in `nums1` but not in `nums2`.
- All unique elements present in `nums2` but not in `nums1`.

Return the result as a list of two lists:
- The first list contains elements only in `nums1`.
- The second list contains elements only in `nums2`.

Example:
```javascript
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should the elements in the resulting lists be returned in any specific order?
   - **A:** No specific order is required, any unique ordering is fine.
   
2. **Q:** What should be done in case `nums1` or `nums2` is empty?
   - **A:** If one of the arrays is empty, the other array's unique elements should be fully included in the corresponding list; the other list should be empty.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - **A:** Usually, constraints will be provided in the full problem statement. For this case, we can assume typical limits for interview problems, e.g., up to thousands of elements.

## Strategy

1. **Use Sets for Uniqueness:** Utilize JavaScript's `Set` to handle unique elements effectively.
2. **Difference Calculation:** Use `Set` operations to find the difference:
   - Elements in `nums1` but not in `nums2`.
   - Elements in `nums2` but not in `nums1`.

### Steps
1. Convert both `nums1` and `nums2` to sets to get unique elements.
2. Iterate through these sets to find differences.
3. Return the differences as arrays.

## Code

```javascript
function findDifference(nums1, nums2) {
    // Convert arrays to sets for uniqueness and easier difference calculation
    const set1 = new Set(nums1);
    const set2 = new Set(nums2);
    
    const diff1 = [...set1].filter(x => !set2.has(x));
    const diff2 = [...set2].filter(x => !set1.has(x));
    
    return [diff1, diff2];
}

// Example usage
const nums1 = [1, 2, 3];
const nums2 = [2, 4, 6];
console.log(findDifference(nums1, nums2)); // Output: [[1, 3], [4, 6]]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Sets:** O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.
- **Filtering Differences:** Each difference calculation involves iterating through elements of one set and checking presence in another set, which is O(n + m).

Overall time complexity: **O(n + m)**

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the distinct elements present in one array but not in the other using the power of Set operations in JavaScript.
