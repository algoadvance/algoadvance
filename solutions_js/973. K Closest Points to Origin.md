[Leetcode 973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l973)
## Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

> Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).
>
> The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x^2 + y^2)`).
>
> You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Example:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: The distance from (1, 3) to the origin is √(10) and from (-2, 2) is √(8).
Since √(8) < √(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The distance from (3, 3) to the origin is √(18), from (5, -1) is √(26), and from (-2, 4) is √(20).
The closest two points are (3, 3) and (-2, 4).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What range of values can `xi` and `yi` take?
   - What is the maximum and minimum value for `k`?
   
2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the output be in any specific order?
   - Can the points have floating-point coordinates?

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Should we compute and return based on the Euclidean distance squared (to avoid floating-point precision issues)?

Assuming:
1. Integer values for coordinates are within a reasonable range.
2. `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= number of points`.
3. The output order does not matter.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var kClosest = function(points, k) {
    return points
        .map(point => [point, point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1]])  // Map points to [point, distance^2]
        .sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1])  // Sort based on the distance
        .slice(0, k)  // Extract the k closest points
        .map(item => item[0]);  // Map back to the original points
};

// Example Usage
console.log(kClosest([[1,3],[-2,2]], 1));  // Output: [[-2,2]]
console.log(kClosest([[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], 2));  // Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
```

## Strategy

1. **Mapping Points to Distances**:
   - For each point `[xi, yi]`, compute and store the squared Euclidean distance to avoid the performance cost of square roots and maintain integer precision.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the points based on the precomputed squared distances.

3. **Slicing**:
   - Take the first `k` elements from the sorted list as they represent the closest points.

4. **Mapping Back To Points**:
   - Extract the actual points from the sorted list of points and distances.

This approach leverages the fact that comparing squared distances avoids unnecessary floating-point operations and remains within integer computation, which is both precise and efficient.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of our solution can be broken down as follows:

1. **Mapping distances**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of points.
2. **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) sorting operation.
3. **Extracting first `k` elements**: \(O(k)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, giving us **O(n log n)**. 

For very large datasets, you might consider alternative approaches like using a min-heap (priority queue) for retrieval, which might offer better performance depending on the context of usage.
