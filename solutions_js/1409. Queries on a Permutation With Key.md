[Leetcode 1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1409)
## Problem Statement
Given the array `queries` of positive integers between `1` and `m`, you have to process all `queries[i]` (from `i=0` to `i=queries.length-1`) according to the following rules:

Initially, you have the permutation `P = [1, 2, 3, ..., m]`.

For the `i-th` query, find the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` (the position `index` is 0-based), then move this value to the front of `P`. 

Notice that the position changes during the process.

Return an array of the length of `queries` where `ans[i]` is the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P` before the `i-th` query.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
queries = [3,1,2,1]
m = 5
```
**Output:**
```
[2,1,2,1]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= m <= 100`
- `1 <= queries.length <= m`
- `1 <= queries[i] <= m`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Should the position be 0-based or 1-based?**
   - The problem specifies 0-based indexing.

2. **Does the position array need to be updated in place, or can we use an auxiliary array?**
   - We can use an auxiliary array to store the positions before each update.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize the Permutation (`P`):** 
   - Create the permutation array `P` as `[1, 2, 3, ..., m]`.

2. **Process Each Query:**
   - Iterate through each query in `queries`.
   - For each `queries[i]`, find the current position of `queries[i]` in `P`.
   - Record this position in the result array.
   - Move `queries[i]` to the front of the permutation array `P`.

3. **Return the Result Array:**
   - Store and return the resultant positions for each query as computed.

## Code
```javascript
const processQueries = (queries, m) => {
    let P = Array.from({length: m}, (_, i) => i + 1);
    let result = [];

    for (let query of queries) {
        let index = P.indexOf(query);
        result.push(index);
        
        // Move the queried number to the front
        P.splice(index, 1);
        P.unshift(query);
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example usage:
const queries = [3, 1, 2, 1];
const m = 5;
console.log(processQueries(queries, m)); // [2, 1, 2, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of `P`:** O(m), where `m` is the size of the permutation.
- **Processing Each Query:**
  - Finding the `index` of an element in `P`: O(m) in the worst case.
  - Modifying the array `P` (splice operation): O(m).
  
Thus, for each query, the overall complexity is O(m). Since there are `n` queries, the total time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of queries and `m` is the length of the permutation.
