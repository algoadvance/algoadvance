[Leetcode 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1380)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix of distinct numbers. Return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column.

Example:
```plaintext
Input:
matrix = [
  [3, 7, 8],
  [9, 11, 13],
  [15, 16, 17]
]

Output:
[15]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the matrix contain negative numbers?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints on the values, so assume it may contain negative numbers.

2. **Can the matrix be non-square (i.e., m â‰  n)?**
   - Yes, the matrix can have different numbers of rows and columns.

3. **What should we return if there are no lucky numbers?**
   - Return an empty list.

## Strategy

1. **Identify row minimums:** For each row in the matrix, find the minimum element and its column index.
2. **Identify column maximums:** For each column in the matrix, find the maximum element.
3. **Find lucky numbers:** A number is a lucky number if it is both the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column. Compare the results from the first two steps to find lucky numbers.

## Code

```javascript
function luckyNumbers(matrix) {
    let m = matrix.length;
    let n = matrix[0].length;
    
    // Step 1: Find the minimum element in each row
    let rowMins = new Array(m).fill(Infinity);
    let rowMinCols = new Array(m);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] < rowMins[i]) {
                rowMins[i] = matrix[i][j];
                rowMinCols[i] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find the maximum element in each column
    let colMaxs = new Array(n).fill(-Infinity);
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] > colMaxs[j]) {
                colMaxs[j] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Find the lucky numbers
    let luckyNumbers = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        let rowMin = rowMins[i];
        let colIndex = rowMinCols[i];
        
        if (colMaxs[colIndex] === rowMin) {
            luckyNumbers.push(rowMin);
        }
    }
    
    return luckyNumbers;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding row minimums:** O(m * n) - We iterate through the entire matrix once to find the minimum element of each row.
- **Finding column maximums:** O(m * n) - We iterate through the entire matrix again to find the maximum element of each column.
- **Finding lucky numbers:** O(m) - Finally, we iterate through each row's minimum to check if it satisfies the lucky number condition.

Overall time complexity: **O(m * n)**

This solution is efficient for matrices of reasonable size and correctly identifies all lucky numbers in the matrix.
