[Leetcode 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1351)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix?
    - The dimensions are `m` (rows) and `n` (columns) where `1 <= m, n <= 100`.
  
2. **Matrix Elements**: Are all the elements guaranteed to be integers?
    - Yes, all elements in the matrix are integers.

3. **Order of the Matrix**: It's mentioned that the matrix is sorted in non-increasing order row-wise and column-wise. Does this mean both rows and columns are independently sorted in decreasing order?
    - Yes, both rows and columns are sorted in non-increasing order.

### Strategy

Given the properties of the matrix:
- Each row is sorted in non-increasing order.
- Each column is sorted in non-increasing order.

We can use a more efficient approach rather than checking each element individually.

### Efficient Approach

1. **Start from the bottom-left corner of the matrix**: 
    - If the element is negative, all elements to the right in that row are also negative (because the row is sorted in non-increasing order).
    - Move one step up.
    - If the element is non-negative, move one step right.

2. **Count the negatives**:
    - Initialize counters for rows and columns.
    - Traverse through the matrix starting from the bottom-left.
    - If the element is negative, add the count of all elements to the right (since those would also be negative), and move one row up.
    - If the element is non-negative, move one column to the right.

### Code

```javascript
var countNegatives = function(grid) {
    let m = grid.length;
    let n = grid[0].length;
    let row = m - 1;
    let col = 0;
    let count = 0;
  
    while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
        if (grid[row][col] < 0) {
            // All elements to the right are also negative
            count += (n - col);
            row--;
        } else {
            col++;
        }
    }
  
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is O(m + n).
  - We potentially iterate over each row and column only once.
  - `m` is the number of rows.
  - `n` is the number of columns.
  
- This is more efficient than the O(m * n) approach of checking every element individually.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables for counting which do not depend on the size of the input matrix.
