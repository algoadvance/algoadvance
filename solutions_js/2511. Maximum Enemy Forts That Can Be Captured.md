[Leetcode 2511. Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2511)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `forts` representing the positions of enemy buildings and your buildings:

- `1` represents your building.
- `-1` represents enemy buildings.
- `0` represents empty land.

You want to capture enemy buildings by moving from your building to another of your buildings moving horizontally, capturing any enemy buildings in that range.

Return the maximum number of enemy buildings you can capture. If it's impossible to capture any enemy buildings, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the buildings only move horizontally?**
   - Yes, movements are restricted to horizontal moves.
   
2. **Are the positions of your buildings (`1`) and enemy buildings (`-1`) fixed in the array?**
   - Yes, the positions are fixed. You can only move through the empty lands (`0`).

3. **Is there a minimum length for the array `forts`?**
   - There's no explicit minimum length mentioned, so we'll assume the array can be of length 1 or more.
   
4. **Are there any constraints on the array elements?**
   - Yes, the elements of the array `forts` are either `1`, `-1`, or `0`.

### Strategy

We'll iterate through the array and look for segments of the array that begin and end with your buildings (values of `1`). For any such segment, we will count the number of enemy buildings (`-1`) present between these two positions.

Steps:
1. Initialize maxCapture to 0 to keep track of the maximum enemies captured.
2. Traverse the array once to handle segments between your buildings.
3. For any identified segments, count the number of enemy buildings (`-1`).
4. Update maxCapture with the higher value when a segment with more captured enemies is found.
5. At the end of the loop, return the value of maxCapture.

### Code

```javascript
function captureForts(forts) {
    let maxCapture = 0;
    let n = forts.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (forts[i] === 1) {
            let j = i + 1;
            while (j < n && forts[j] !== 1) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j < n && forts[j] === 1) {
                let countEnemies = 0;
                for (let k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    if (forts[k] === -1) countEnemies++;
                }
                maxCapture = Math.max(maxCapture, countEnemies);
            }
            i = j - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return maxCapture;
}

// Example usage
console.log(captureForts([1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,1])); // Expected output: 1
console.log(captureForts([0,0,1,-1]));         // Expected output: 0
console.log(captureForts([-1,0,0,0,0,1,1]));   // Expected output: 0
console.log(captureForts([1,-1,0,0,-1,0,1])); // Expected output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** because we are traversing the array in a single pass. The nested loop within checking the enemies in the segment is still proportional to the length of the array and runs inside the same loop without creating additional loops causing the complexity to remain linear. So, **O(n) + O(n)** simplifies to **O(n)**.

This ensures that the solution is efficient for large input sizes.
