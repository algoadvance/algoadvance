[Leetcode 2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2406)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i]` represents the interval `[left_i, right_i)`. You need to divide the intervals into the minimum number of groups, so that no two intervals in the same group intersect (i.e., for any two intervals `[left_i, right_i)`, and `[left_j, right_j)` in the same group, either `right_i <= left_j`, or `right_j <= left_i` should hold).

Return the minimum number of groups required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: 
   - What is the maximum number of intervals that can be given in the `intervals` array?
   - Answer: Usually, constraints will be provided in the problem description. For our purposes, we’ll assume a reasonable upper limit like 10^5.

2. **Intervals Properties**:
   - Can the intervals be negative or only non-negative?
   - Answer: Intervals can be both positive and negative.

3. **Interval Boundaries**:
   - Are both endpoints of the intervals inclusive or is it half-open interval?
   - Answer: As per problem statement, it’s a half-open interval, i.e., `[left_i, right_i)`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can borrow concepts from the "sweep line" algorithm often used in interval-related problems:

1. **Event Points**: For each interval, consider two events - start and end.
2. **Sort Events**: Sort all the events based on time. If two events have the same time, prioritize the end event over the start event.
   - This ensures that the interval ends before another one starts at the same time.
3. **Sweeping**: Sweep through the events and maintain a count of overlapping intervals at any given point in time.
4. **Max Overlaps**: The maximum count of overlapping intervals during the sweep is the answer.

## Code

```javascript
function minGroups(intervals) {
    // Step 1: Create an array of events.
    let events = [];
    
    for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
        events.push([start, 1]);   // Interval starts (1 means start)
        events.push([end, -1]);    // Interval ends (-1 means end)
    }
    
    // Step 2: Sort events, prioritizing end events when times are equal.
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[1] - b[1]);
    
    // Step 3: Sweep through events to find maximum overlaps.
    let maxOverlap = 0;
    let currentOverlap = 0;
    
    for (const [, type] of events) {
        currentOverlap += type;
        maxOverlap = Math.max(maxOverlap, currentOverlap);
    }
    
    return maxOverlap;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Events**: O(n log n) where n is the number of intervals.
- **Sweeping through Events**: O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

This solution is efficient and leverages sorting and a greedy approach to solve the problem of managing overlapping intervals.
