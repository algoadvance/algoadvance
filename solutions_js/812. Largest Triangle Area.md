[Leetcode 812. Largest Triangle Area](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l812)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of points in the 2D plane, each point has integer coordinates. Your task is to find the largest possible area of a triangle formed by any three of the given points.

You need to return that area as a float number, and it should be accurate up to 5 decimal places.

Assume the list of points has at least three points and that no three points are collinear.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Can the list contain duplicate points? (Assuming no for simplicity).
2. **Output Precision**: Should the resulting area be formatted to a specific precision or simply accurate up to 5 decimal places? (Formatted to 5 decimal places).
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of points provided? (Typically, `3 <= points.length <= 50`).

### Strategy
1. **Formula for Area of Triangle**: We can use the Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula) for calculating the area of the triangle formed by three points \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), \((x3, y3)\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = 0.5 \cdot | x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2) |
   \]
2. **Brute Force Approach**: Since the number of points is reasonably small (up to 50), we can afford to check all possible combinations of three points (combinations of n points taken 3 at a time). Calculate the area for each combination and keep track of the maximum area found.
3. **Precision Handling**: Use JavaScript `toFixed()` method to ensure the result is formatted to 5 decimal places.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestTriangleArea = function(points) {
    let maxArea = 0;
    
    function calculateArea(p1, p2, p3) {
        let [x1, y1] = p1;
        let [x2, y2] = p2;
        let [x3, y3] = p3;
        
        // Shoelace formula
        let area = Math.abs(x1 * (y2 - y3) + 
                            x2 * (y3 - y1) + 
                            x3 * (y1 - y2)) / 2;
        
        return area;
    }
    
    // Iterate all combinations of three points
    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            for (let k = j + 1; k < points.length; k++) {
                let area = calculateArea(points[i], points[j], points[k]);
                if (area > maxArea) {
                    maxArea = area;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea.toFixed(5);
};

// Example usage:
let points = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [0,2], [2,0]];
console.log(largestTriangleArea(points));  // -> Expected area with correct output
```

### Time Complexity
- **Combinations**: We are iterating over all combinations of 3 points from `n`, which gives a complexity of \(O(\binom{n}{3})\). This simplifies to \(O(n^3)\).
- **Area Calculation**: Each calculation of the area involves a constant time operation.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^3)**. Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.
