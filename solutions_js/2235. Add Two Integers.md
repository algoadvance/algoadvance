[Leetcode 2235. Add Two Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2235)
### Problem Statement:
> Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of the two integers.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Q: Can the input integers be negative?
   A: Yes, the input integers can be negative.
2. Q: What is the range of the input integers?
   A: The problem does not specify any constraints, so we assume they are within the bounds of typical 32-bit signed integers, i.e., -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1.
3. Q: Do we need to handle any special case like input being non-integer?
   A: No, the prompt specifies that both inputs are integers, so it simplifies the implementation.

### Strategy:
This problem is straightforward as it simply involves adding two integers. The steps we will follow are:
1. Define a function that accepts two parameters.
2. Calculate the sum of these two parameters.
3. Return the computed sum.

### Code:
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num1
 * @param {number} num2
 * @return {number}
 */
var sum = function(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this function is O(1) because the addition operation is performed in constant time regardless of the size or value of the input integers.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this function is O(1) because no extra space is used; we are merely returning the result of the addition.

This concludes the solution, and it meets the problem requirements efficiently.
