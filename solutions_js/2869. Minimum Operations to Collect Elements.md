[Leetcode 2869. Minimum Operations to Collect Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2869)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, your task is to determine the minimum number of operations to collect `k` distinct positive integers from the given array. In one operation, you can take an element from the array (you can take the same element multiple times). The result should be an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to collect `k` distinct positive integers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicates**: Can there be duplicates in the `nums` array?
   - Yes, duplicates can be present.

2. **Negative Integers**: Should we consider negative integers in the array?
   - No, only positive integers should be considered.

3. **All Elements Less Than k**: What if the array doesn't contain `k` distinct positive integers?
   - It will be assumed that the array has at least `k` distinct positive integers.

4. **Constraints**:
   - It would be useful to understand the constraints regarding the size of `nums` and the value of `k`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Filter**: Create a set to collect all distinct positive integers from `nums`.
2. **Select `k` Distinct**: Select the smallest `k` distinct positive integers.
3. **Count Operations**: Count the number of operations (array elements taken) to get these `k` distinct positive integers.
4. **Return**: Return the count of operations.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
function minOperationsToCollectKDistinct(nums, k) {
    const uniquePositives = new Set();

    // Collect distinct positive integers from nums
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > 0) uniquePositives.add(num);
        if (uniquePositives.size === k) break;
    }

    // If we can't find k distinct, a problem constraint is violated
    if (uniquePositives.size < k) {
        throw new Error("The array does not contain enough distinct positive integers.");
    }

    let count = 0;
    const collected = new Set();

    // Count operations needed to collect k distinct positive integers
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > 0 && !collected.has(num)) {
            collected.add(num);
            count++;

            if (collected.size === k) break;
        } else if (collected.has(num)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. We traverse the array a few times, but each operation (like adding to a set or checking its size) is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where we store unique positive integers and count operations.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of operations to collect `k` distinct positive integers from the array.
