[Leetcode 2097. Valid Arrangement of Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2097)
## Problem Statement

You are given 2D integer array `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a directed edge going from `a_i` to `b_i`. 

You need to find any valid arrangement of pairs that satisfies the following conditions:
- Each pair must be used exactly once.
- Every direct edge [a, b] in the arrangement should match right after the direct edge [c, a] in the previous step.

Return the valid arrangement of pairs.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that there is always a solution to the problem?
2. Is it possible for pairs to have repeated elements?
3. What are the constraints on the number of pairs and the values within each pair?

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using Eulerian Path in a directed graph. To find an Eulerian Path (a path that visits every edge exactly once):
1. **Build the Graph:** Create an adjacency list for the directed graph and maintain in-degrees and out-degrees of vertices.
2. **Identify Starting Point:** For an Eulerian Path in a directed graph, we typically start from a vertex whose out-degree is greater than its in-degree by one. If no such vertex exists, we can start from any vertex with an outgoing edge.
3. **Hierholzer's Algorithm:** Perform Hierholzer's algorithm to construct the path.

## Code

```javascript
var validArrangement = function(pairs) {
    const graph = new Map();
    const inDegree = new Map();
    const outDegree = new Map();

    // Build the graph, and count in-degrees and out-degrees
    for (const [u, v] of pairs) {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, []);
        graph.get(u).push(v);

        outDegree.set(u, (outDegree.get(u) || 0) + 1);
        inDegree.set(v, (inDegree.get(v) || 0) + 1);
        if (!inDegree.has(u)) inDegree.set(u, 0);
    }

    // Find the starting point for Eulerian Path
    let start = pairs[0][0];
    for (const [u, outCount] of outDegree.entries()) {
        if (outDegree.get(u) - (inDegree.get(u) || 0) === 1) {
            start = u;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Hierholzer's Algorithm to find the Eulerian Path
    const result = [];
    const stack = [start];

    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const node = stack[stack.length - 1];
        if (graph.get(node).length === 0) {
            result.push(stack.pop());
        } else {
            stack.push(graph.get(node).pop());
        }
    }

    // The result will be in reverse order, so reverse it back
    result.reverse();

    // Convert path to pairs
    const pathPairs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < result.length - 1; i++) {
        pathPairs.push([result[i], result[i + 1]]);
    }

    return pathPairs;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of pairs. This is because:
- Building the graph takes **O(N)** time.
- Finding the Eulerian path using Hierholzer's algorithm also runs in **O(N)** time, as each edge and vertex is processed once.

This ensures that the solution is efficient for large input sizes as long as the input constraints are reasonable.
