[Leetcode 2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2226)
## Problem Statement

We have n packs of candies. The ith pack contains `candies[i]` candies. We want to split all candies among `k` children such that each child gets the **same exact number** of candies. Each child will eat all the candies that the child gets.

However, there can be some leftover pieces of candies. We want to divide the candies in such a way that each child gets the **maximum number** of candies.

Given an integer array `candies` where `candies[i]` denotes the number of candies in the ith pack and an integer `k`, return the **maximum number** of candies each child can get.

### Example
```text
Input: candies = [5, 8, 6], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: To get 5 candies per child, each child will eat from the following packs:
- First child eats 5 and 1 from packs 1 and 2.
- Second child eats 7 from pack 2.
- Third child eats 5 from pack 3.
So, each child gets 5 candies and the maximum number of candies will be 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `candies` array be empty?**
   - No, there will be at least one pack of candies.
   
2. **What is the value range for `k` and length of `candies`?**
   - `1 <= candies.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= candies[i] <= 10^7`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^9`
   
3. **What if `k` is 0?**
   - If `k` is 0, no child needs candies, so the maximum candies each child can get is 0.
   
4. **If `k` is greater than the number of packs, should we handle it?**
   - Yes, distribute candies accordingly; the method should still work.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum number of candies each child can get.
   - Set the lower bound `low` to 0 and the upper bound `high` to the maximum number of candies in the largest pack.
   - Check if it's possible to allocate `mid` candies to each child, where `mid` is the midpoint of `low` and `high`.
   - If it's possible, move the lower bound up to `mid + 1`; otherwise, move the upper bound down to `mid - 1`.
   - This approach works efficiently due to the logarithmic reduction in search space (log(c)) combined with linear checking for each midpoint with `O(n)` complexity.

## Time Complexity

- The binary search part takes `O(log(max_candies))` where `max_candies` is the largest number of candies in any single pack.
- For each binary search step, we check all packs, which takes `O(n)`.
- Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n * log(max_candies))`.

## Code
```javascript
function maxCandies(candies, k) {
    if (k === 0) return 0;
    
    let low = 0, high = Math.max(...candies);
    
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        
        if (canDistribute(candies, k, mid)) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return high;
}

function canDistribute(candies, k, mid) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let candy of candies) {
        count += Math.floor(candy / mid);
    }
    return count >= k;
}

// Example usage
console.log(maxCandies([5, 8, 6], 3));  // Output: 5
```

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of candies each child can receive by leveraging binary search combined with a simple checking function.
