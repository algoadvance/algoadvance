[Leetcode 962. Maximum Width Ramp](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l962)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of integers, a ramp is a tuple `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`. Find the maximum width of a ramp in `A`. If one doesn't exist, return `0`.

For example:
- Input: `A = [6, 0, 8, 2, 1, 5]`
- Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The maximum ramp is `(1, 5)` with A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the elements in the array distinct?
   - No, the elements can be repeated.
2. What is the maximum size of the array?
   - The size of the array can be up to 50000.
3. Are there any constraints on the elements of the array?
   - The array elements are integers, and there are no specific constraints mentioned regarding their range.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a naive O(n^2) approach where we check every pair `(i, j)` would be inefficient for large arrays. Instead, we will use a more optimal strategy:

1. **Monotonic Stack**: First, traverse the array to create a stack that maintains the decreasing sequence of values and positions. This helps to identify potential starting positions for ramps.

2. **Backward Traversal**: Traverse the array from the right end to the left. For each element in this traversal, check against the stack to find the potential maximum width ramp. Pop elements from the stack that meet the condition `A[stack[top]] <= A[j]` and update the maximum width accordingly.

### Code

```javascript
function maxWidthRamp(A) {
    const n = A.length;
    const stack = [];
    let maxWidth = 0;

    // Step 1: Populate stack with decreasing sequence indices
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (stack.length === 0 || A[stack[stack.length - 1]] > A[i]) {
            stack.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Backward traversal to find max width
    for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && A[stack[stack.length - 1]] <= A[j]) {
            maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, j - stack.pop());
        }
    }

    return maxWidth;
}

// Example usage:
let A = [6, 0, 8, 2, 1, 5];
console.log(maxWidthRamp(A)); // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The first loop runs O(n) to generate the stack.
  - The second loop also runs O(n) due to the single traversal from right to left.
  - Each stack operation (push and pop) happens at most `n` times.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The stack can store up to `n` elements in the worst case.
