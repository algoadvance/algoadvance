[Leetcode 922. Sort Array By Parity II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l922)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, half of the integers in `nums` are odd, and the other half are even.

We need to rearrange the array in such a way that when arranged, each even index is followed by an element with an even value, and each odd index is followed by an element with an odd value.

Return the modified array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: 
   - What are the constraints on the size of the input array, `nums`?
   - Can the array be empty?

2. **Data Constraints**: 
   - Are there any constraints on the range of values of elements in `nums`?
   
3. **Uniqueness**: 
   - Are the elements in `nums` unique, or can there be duplicates?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use two pointers: one `evenIdx` to track the position for the even index and `oddIdx` for the odd index.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
   - Traverse the array using a single loop and place the elements at their respective even and odd indexes based on their values.
   - If the number is even, place it at the `evenIdx` and increment `evenIdx` by 2.
   - If the number is odd, place it at the `oddIdx` and increment `oddIdx` by 2.
   
3. **Output**:
   - Return the modified array.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function sortArrayByParityII(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const result = new Array(n);
    let evenIdx = 0;
    let oddIdx = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] % 2 === 0) {
            result[evenIdx] = nums[i];
            evenIdx += 2;
        } else {
            result[oddIdx] = nums[i];
            oddIdx += 2;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are traversing the array only once.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the additional array `result` that we are creating to store the sorted elements.

### Additional Notes

- If the input guarantees that exactly half of the elements are even and half are odd, then this solution will always work correctly.
- For in-place sorting, a more complex swapping-based approach could be considered to reduce the extra space usage from O(n) to O(1).

Feel free to suggest any other constraints or requirements you may have for this problem!
