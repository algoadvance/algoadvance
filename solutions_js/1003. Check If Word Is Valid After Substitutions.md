[Leetcode 1003. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1003)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid. A string `s` is valid if it can be transformed into an empty string by repeatedly deleting substrings "abc" in any order.

Return `true` if the string is valid, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, an empty string is a valid input and it should return `true`.

2. **What is the length constraint of the input string?**
   - The length of the input string can be between 1 and 2000 characters.

3. **Do we need to consider any special characters or spaces?**
   - No, the input string will only contain the letters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Can the deletions of "abc" substrings be nested?**
   - Yes, deleting "abc" could result in new "abc" substrings forming which should also be deleted if possible.

### Strategy

We can use a stack to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to traverse the string character by character and use a stack to keep track of the sequence of characters.

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Traverse through each character in the string:
   - Push each character onto the stack.
   - Every time you push a character, check if the top three characters in the stack form the sequence "abc".
   - If they do, pop these three characters from the stack.
3. Once you finish processing all characters, check if the stack is empty.
   - If it is empty, return `true`, indicating that the string is valid.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isValid(s) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let char of s) {
        stack.push(char);
        if (stack.length >= 3 && stack.slice(-3).join('') === 'abc') {
            stack.pop();
            stack.pop();
            stack.pop();
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse each character of the input string exactly once, pushing and popping characters from the stack. Each operation (push and pop) takes constant time.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst case, if no "abc" substrings can be removed, we will store all characters in the stack, which uses O(n) space.

This method ensures that we are efficiently checking and removing "abc" substrings while maintaining linear time complexity and optimal space usage.
