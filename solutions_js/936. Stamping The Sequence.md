[Leetcode 936. Stamping The Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l936)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `stamp` and `target`. Initially, there is a string `target` of length `n` that consists of only question marks `????`.

You can create `target` using the following steps:
1. Replace the subarray of `target` (the subarray must correspond to `stamp`) of at most 10 consecutive characters by `stamp`.
2. You cannot replace the subarray twice in the same position during the process.

Your goal is to find a sequence of indices where the stamps should be placed to create the `target`. If multiple sequences exist, return any of them. If it is not possible to create the `target`, return an empty array.

### Example 1:

```
Input: stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation:
- Replace "abc" with leading a, b, c 
- Result: "abc||ba||bc"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: stamp = "abca", target = "aabcaca"
Output: [3, 0, 1]
Explanation:
```


### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length for the `stamp` and `target`?
2. Should we return the indices as a list of numbers in any specific order?

## Strategy

1. We'll try to reverse the process of stamping. Instead of thinking about creating `target` from `stamp`, we'll think about erasing `stamp` from `target` to reduce it to just question marks.
2. We'll repeatedly look for a substring in `target` that matches `stamp` or could be matched by changing some of `target`'s characters to question marks.
3. When we find such a substring, we'll replace it completely with question marks.
4. We'll keep track of the starting indices of these replacements.
5. If we can eventually make `target` consist solely of question marks, then our list of indices is a valid answer.
6. We'll reverse this list at the end to reflect the reverse process.

## Code

```javascript
function movesToStamp(stamp, target) {
    const sLen = stamp.length;
    const tLen = target.length;
    const tArr = target.split('');
    const sArr = stamp.split('');
    const result = [];
    let changed = true;

    const canStamp = (t, p) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            if (t[i + p] !== '?' && t[i + p] !== sArr[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    const doStamp = (t, p) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            t[i + p] = '?';
        }
    };

    while (changed) {
        changed = false;
        for (let i = 0; i <= tLen - sLen; i++) {
            if (canStamp(tArr, i)) {
                result.push(i);
                doStamp(tArr, i);
                changed = true;
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < tLen; i++) {
        if (tArr[i] !== '?') {
            return [];
        }
    }

    return result.reverse();
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Outer loop (while changed) Complexity:** In the worst case, this loop will run n/s times where n is the length of target and s is the length of stamp.
2. **Inner loop (for loop):** In the worst case, this will iterate through the entire `target` string n times.
3. **canStamp Function:** Each call to this function takes constant time O(s) where s is the length of stamp.
4. **Total Time Complexity:** Thus, the time complexity is O(n * (n/s) * s) which simplifies to **O(n^2)**.
