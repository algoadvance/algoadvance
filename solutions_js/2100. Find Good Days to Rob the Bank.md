[Leetcode 2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2100)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `security`, where `security[i]` is the number of guards on duty on the i-th day. You are also given an integer `time`.

The i-th day is a good day to rob the bank if all the following conditions are met:

1. For every `j` in the range `[i - time, i]`, `security[j]` is non-increasing.
2. For every `k` in the range `[i, i + time]`, `security[k]` is non-decreasing.

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order of the elements in the output list does not matter.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Bounds of `security` array and `time`:**
   - What is the length of the `security` array?
   - What values can `security` elements take?
   - What is the range for `time`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `time` is 0?
   - Should we consider out-of-bound indices in the security array?
   - How to handle days where there are insufficient days before or after an index for the given `time`?

These clarifications will help us frame our solution accurately.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} security
 * @param {number} time
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var goodDaysToRobBank = function(security, time) {
    if (time === 0) return [...Array(security.length).keys()];

    const n = security.length;
    const goodDays = [];
  
    // Create two arrays to track non-increasing and non-decreasing sequences
    const nonIncreasing = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const nonDecreasing = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Fill nonIncreasing array
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (security[i] <= security[i - 1]) {
            nonIncreasing[i] = nonIncreasing[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Fill nonDecreasing array
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (security[i] <= security[i + 1]) {
            nonDecreasing[i] = nonDecreasing[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Find all good days
    for (let i = time; i < n - time; i++) {
        if (nonIncreasing[i] >= time && nonDecreasing[i] >= time) {
            goodDays.push(i);
        }
    }
  
    return goodDays;
};

// Example usage:
// const security = [5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 2];
// const time = 2;
// console.log(goodDaysToRobBank(security, time)); // Output: [2, 3]
```

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing Arrays:**
   - We use two auxiliary arrays `nonIncreasing` and `nonDecreasing`.
   - `nonIncreasing[i]` will store the length of the non-increasing subsequence ending at `i`.
   - `nonDecreasing[i]` will store the length of the non-decreasing subsequence starting at `i`.

2. **Filling the Arrays:**
   - Traverse the `security` array to fill `nonIncreasing` by comparing each day with the previous day.
   - Traverse the `security` array in reverse to fill `nonDecreasing` by comparing each day with the next day.

3. **Finding Good Days:**
   - Iterate through the `security` array and check if the day satisfies both non-increasing and non-decreasing conditions using the `nonIncreasing` and `nonDecreasing` arrays.
   - Collect such days into an array and return it.

### Time Complexity

1. **Auxiliary Arrays Creation:**
   - Filling `nonIncreasing` and `nonDecreasing` arrays will each take O(n) time.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - Iterating through the `security` array to find good days also takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `security` array. This approach is efficient and should work well within the constraints typically expected in coding problems.
