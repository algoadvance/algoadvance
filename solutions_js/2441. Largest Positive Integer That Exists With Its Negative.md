[Leetcode 2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2441)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zero, find the largest positive integer `k` such that `k` and `-k` both exist in the array. If there is no such integer, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the expected size of the input array `nums`?
2. **Value Range**: What is the range of values that the integers in `nums` can take?
3. **Output Definition**: If multiple valid `k` values exist, should we return the largest one?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are there any other edge cases we should be aware of, such as very small or large number of elements?

### Assumptions

- The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The elements in `nums` are unique.
- The array does not contain zero.
- We need to find the largest integer `k` such that both `k` and `-k` exist in the array.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Set**: We can use a set to store all the elements in the array. This will allow us to efficiently check if the negative counterpart of a given number exists in the array.
2. **Iterate Through Array**: Loop through the array and for each element, check if its negative counterpart is in the set.
3. **Track the Maximum `k`**: While iterating, keep track of the maximum positive integer `k` for which both `k` and `-k` exist in the array.
4. **Output Result**: After processing the array, return the maximum `k` found or `-1` if no such `k` was found.

### Code

```javascript
function findMaxK(nums) {
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let largestK = -1;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (numSet.has(-num)) {
            largestK = Math.max(largestK, Math.abs(num));
        }
    }

    return largestK;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findMaxK([3, 2, -2, 5, -3])); // Output: 3
console.log(findMaxK([1, 2, 3, -4]));   // Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once and each set operation (addition, check) is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), as we are storing each element of the array in a set.

This solution should be efficient for the typical constraints you might encounter in coding interviews.
