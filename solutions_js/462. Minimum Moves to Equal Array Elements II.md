[Leetcode 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l462)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal. In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two moves are needed (2 moves to equalize all elements to 2).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the array always integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **Is the size of the array (n) within a reasonable limit for common algorithmic approaches?**
   - Yes, typically within constraints suitable for O(n log n) solutions.
3. **Are there any negative numbers or zeros in the array?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers and zeros.
4. **Is making all elements of the array equalized to a specific number the goal?**
   - Yes, the goal is to minimize the number of moves to make all elements equal.

## Code

```javascript
function minMoves2(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let median = nums[Math.floor(nums.length / 2)];
    let moves = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        moves += Math.abs(num - median);
    }

    return moves;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minMoves2([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 2
console.log(minMoves2([1, 10, 2, 9])); // Output: 16
```

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** 
   - First, sort the input array `nums`. Sorting helps in easily finding the median of the array.
   
2. **Find the Median:**
   - The median is the middle element in the sorted array (or the average of the two middle elements if the array length is even). The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from all other points.
   
3. **Calculate Moves:**
   - Iterate through the array and sum up the absolute differences between each element and the median. This sum represents the minimum number of moves needed to equalize all elements.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** This takes `O(n log n)` time.
- **Finding the median:** This is an `O(1)` operation.
- **Calculating moves:** This takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
