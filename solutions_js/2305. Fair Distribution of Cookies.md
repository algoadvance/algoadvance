[Leetcode 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2305)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `cookies` where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the i-th bag and an integer `k`, representing the number of children to distribute these cookies to, return the minimum possible unfairness of distributing the cookies.

Unfairness is defined as the maximum total cookies given to any single child in the current distribution.

### Example
```
Input: cookies = [8, 15, 10, 20, 8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8, 15, 8] and [10, 20]
- The maximum number of cookies given to any single child is 31, which is minimized.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `k` is greater than the number of bags of cookies?
   - What is the minimum and maximum value for cookies in any bag?
   - Are cookies[i] always positive integers?

2. **Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the cookies array?
   - What is the value range for `k`?

## Strategy
The problem can be approached using backtracking. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array to keep track of the total cookies for each child.
2. **Backtracking Function**: Use a recursive function to try every possible distribution of cookies:
   - Base case: If all cookies have been distributed, calculate the current maximum unfairness.
   - Recursive case: Try giving the current bag of cookies to each child and recurse for the next bag.
3. **Minimum Unfairness Calculation**: Track the minimum unfairness encountered.

## Code
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cookies
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var distributeCookies = function(cookies, k) {
    const distribute = Array(k).fill(0);
    let result = Infinity;

    const backtrack = (index) => {
        if (index === cookies.length) {
            result = Math.min(result, Math.max(...distribute));
            return;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            distribute[i] += cookies[index];
            backtrack(index + 1);
            distribute[i] -= cookies[index];
            
            if (distribute[i] === 0) break;  // optimization to avoid redundant work
        }
    };

    backtrack(0);

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Worst-case time complexity**: `O(k^n)`, where `n` is the number of cookie bags. This arises because, in the worst case, each of the `n` cookie bags can be given to any of the `k` children.
- **Optimization Assumption**: The optimization with `break` reduces unnecessary recursive calls, but the algorithm is still exponential in nature.

This solution ensures we explore all possible distributions using backtracking, while optimizations help prune unnecessary paths.
