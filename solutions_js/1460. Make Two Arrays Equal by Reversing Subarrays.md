[Leetcode 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1460)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `target` and `arr` of the same length. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return `true` if you can make `arr` equal to `target`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint for the arrays?**
   - The arrays can have lengths ranging between 1 and `10^5`.

2. **Can the arrays contain negative integers?**
   - Yes, arrays can contain both negative and positive integers.

3. **Can we have duplicate values in the arrays?**
   - Yes, arrays can contain duplicate values.

4. **What should be returned if `target` or `arr` is empty?**
   - Since it's given that both arrays are of the same length and within constraints, this case does not apply to an empty array.

### Strategy

To determine if `arr` can be rearranged to match `target` by reversing any subarrays:
1. **Check if Both Arrays Contain the Same Elements:**
   - The order of elements can be changed by reversing subarrays, so the order does not matter.
   - Hence, if the arrays contain the exact same elements with the same counts (i.e., they have the same frequency distribution for each number), it is possible to rearrange `arr` to match `target`.

### Code

```javascript
var canBeEqual = function(target, arr) {
    // Sort both arrays
    target.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Compare sorted arrays
    for (let i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] !== arr[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(canBeEqual([1,2,3,4], [2,4,1,3])); // true
console.log(canBeEqual([7], [7])); // true
console.log(canBeEqual([3,7,9], [3,7,11])); // false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The sorting of both arrays will take \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the arrays.
- **Comparison:** Comparing the two sorted arrays will take \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if `arr` can be transformed to match `target` using the allowed operations.
