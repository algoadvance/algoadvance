[Leetcode 704. Binary Search](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l704)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of `n` integers and a target value, write a function to search for the target in the array. If the target exists, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of data does the array contain?**
   - The array contains integers.
  
2. **What should be the return value if the target is not found in the array?**
   - Return `-1` if the target is not found.

3. **Is the array sorted in ascending or descending order?**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.

4. **Can there be duplicate values in the array?**
   - The problem statement does not specify uniqueness, but typically binary searches assume the values are unique, though even if there are duplicates, the algorithm will still work to find one occurrence.

### Strategy

The binary search algorithm is a classic example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm. The basic idea is:

1. Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. Compute the middle index and compare the middle value with the target.
3. If the target matches the middle value, return the middle index.
4. If the target is less than the middle value, discard the right half by updating the `right` pointer.
5. If the target is greater than the middle value, discard the left half by updating the `left` pointer.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the pointers converge. If the target is not found, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
function binarySearch(nums, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** `O(1)` - The target is found at the first middle index checked.
- **Average and Worst Case:** `O(log n)` - Each comparison halves the size of the list, leading to logarithmic time complexity.

This satisfies the requirement for an `O(log n)` runtime complexity, making it an efficient solution for the given problem.
