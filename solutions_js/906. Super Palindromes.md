[Leetcode 906. Super Palindromes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l906)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right` represented as strings, return the number of superpalindromes integers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.

A **superpalindrome** is a palindrome whose square is also a palindrome.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
   - Are `left` and `right` always valid integers as strings?
   - Can the range given by `left` and `right` be very large?

2. **Palindromes**:
   - Should we consider only non-negative integers as palindromes?
   - Are there any constraints on the input length for `left` and `right`?

3. **Output**:
   - Should the output be an integer representing the count of superpalindromes?

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} left
 * @param {string} right
 * @return {number}
 */
const isPalindrome = (num) => {
  const str = num.toString();
  let len = str.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(len / 2); i++) {
    if (str[i] !== str[len - 1 - i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};

const superpalindromesInRange = function(left, right) {
  let L = BigInt(left);
  let R = BigInt(right);
  let MAGIC = 100000;
  
  let count = 0;
  
  for (let k = 0; k < MAGIC; ++k) {
    let s = k.toString();
    let t = s + [...s].reverse().join("");
    let v = BigInt(t) * BigInt(t);
    if (v > R) break;
    if (v >= L && isPalindrome(v.toString())) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  
  for (let k = 0; k < MAGIC; ++k) {
    let s = k.toString();
    let t = s + [...s.slice(0, -1)].reverse().join("");
    let v = BigInt(t) * BigInt(t);
    if (v > R) break;
    if (v >= L && isPalindrome(v.toString())) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Identify Palindromes**:
   - A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. For instance, `121` and `1001` are palindromes.

2. **Superpalindromes**:
   - We need both the number and its square to be palindromes.

3. **Range**:
   - Convert `left` and `right` to `BigInt` given the potential large sizes.
   - Generate palindromes up to a certain limit (`MAGIC = 100000`) twice, once for even length and once for odd length.

4. **Check Palindrome**:
   - Use helper function `isPalindrome` to check whether a number is a palindrome.

5. **Count Valid Superpalindromes**:
   - For each candidate palindrome, compute its square and check both the conditions of being in the range and being a palindrome.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The complexity primarily hinges on generating the palindromes and checking each possible candidate. Given the `MAGIC` constant, it is bound linearly by this constant, resulting in `O(M^2)` operations where `M` is the palindrome length bound.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is primarily due to the storage of the `BigInt` numbers and string operations, which is relatively minimal in comparison to processing time.
