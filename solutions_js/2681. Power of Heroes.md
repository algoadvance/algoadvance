[Leetcode 2681. Power of Heroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2681)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array of positive integers `nums` which represents the power of heroes. The power of a group of heroes is defined as the product of the maximum power of heroes and the sum of all heroes' powers in that group. We need to find the maximum power of any non-empty group of heroes. 

Given:
- `nums` is an array of integers with length `n` where `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- All elements in `nums` are positive integers.

Return the maximum power of any group of heroes modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that `nums.length` is at least 1.

2. **Should the solution consider all subsets of the array?**
   - Yes, we need to consider all non-empty subsets to find the maximum power.

3. **Is the result supposed to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`?**
   - Yes, the result must be returned as `result % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - The brute-force approach would involve generating all subsets and calculating the power for each subset. This is not feasible for `n = 10^5` due to the exponential number of subsets.

2. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
   - Use a prefix sum to efficiently get the sum of the current group.
   - Iterate through the sorted array and, at each step, calculate the power of the group ending at the current element (which is now the maximum for that group).
   - Maintain a running maximum of these powers.
   
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxPower = function(nums) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let maxPower = 0;
    let prefixSum = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        prefixSum %= MOD;  // keep prefixSum within the mod
        maxPower = Math.max(maxPower, num * prefixSum);
    }
    
    return maxPower % MOD;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxPower([3, 1, 4, 1, 5]));  // Example output
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Iteration and Calculation:** `O(n)`, for the single pass through the array.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in `O(n log n)`. The space complexity is `O(1)` additional space beyond the input array.
