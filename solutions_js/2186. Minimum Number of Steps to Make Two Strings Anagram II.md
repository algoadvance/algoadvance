[Leetcode 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2186)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`. In one step, you can delete exactly one character from either string. The goal is to determine the minimum number of steps required to make `s1` and `s2` anagrams of each other.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input constraints?**
   - The strings may contain lowercase English letters only.
   - The lengths of the strings could be different.
2. **Edge cases?**
   - Both strings are already anagrams.
   - One or both strings are empty.

### Strategy:
To determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the two strings anagrams, we can follow these steps:
1. **Count Frequency of Each Character**: Use frequency arrays (or hashmaps) to count occurrences of each character in both strings.
2. **Compute Differences**: For each character 'a' to 'z', compute the difference in counts between the two strings.
3. **Sum the Absolute Differences**: The sum of these differences will give the total number of deletions needed.

### Code:
```javascript
function minSteps(s1, s2) {
    // Create frequency maps for both strings
    const freq1 = Array(26).fill(0);
    const freq2 = Array(26).fill(0);

    // Helper function to map characters to array indices
    const charToIndex = char => char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    // Populate frequency arrays
    for (const char of s1) {
        freq1[charToIndex(char)]++;
    }

    for (const char of s2) {
        freq2[charToIndex(char)]++;
    }

    // Calculate the minimum number of steps to make both strings anagrams
    let steps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        steps += Math.abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]);
    }

    return steps;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minSteps("leetcode", "coats")); // Output: 7
console.log(minSteps("night", "thing"));    // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Counting Characters**: O(n + m), where n is the length of `s1` and m is the length of `s2`.
- **Calculating Differences**: O(1) since we're always iterating over a constant number of characters.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**. The space complexity is **O(1)** for the frequency arrays, as their size doesn't depend on the input sizes but instead is fixed at 26 elements.
