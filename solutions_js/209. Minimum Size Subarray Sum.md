[Leetcode 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l209)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

- **Example 1:**
  ``` 
  Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
  ```
- **Example 2:**
  ```
  Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
  Output: 1
  ```
- **Example 3:**
  ```
  Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
  Output: 0
  ```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `target` be 0 or negative?
   **A**: No, `target` is always a positive integer as given by the problem statement.
   
2. **Q**: Is the array `nums` guaranteed to contain only positive integers?
   **A**: Yes, the array `nums` consists of positive integers.

3. **Q**: What should be returned if no subarray satisfies the condition?
   **A**: Return 0 if no contiguous subarray sum satisfies the condition.

4. **Q**: Can the array `nums` be empty?
   **A**: No, the array will contain at least one positive integer according to the problem constraints.

### Strategy

We need to find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. The optimal way to do this is by using a sliding window approach:
1. Use two pointers (or indices), typically `start` and `end`, to represent the current window.
2. Expand the window by advancing `end` and keep a running sum of the elements within the window.
3. Once the sum is greater than or equal to `target`, try to shrink the window from the left by moving the `start` pointer to the right, while updating the minimal length of such windows.
4. Continue this process until `end` reaches the end of the array.

### Time Complexity

The sliding window approach allows us to achieve this in O(n) time since each element is visited at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and at most once by the `start` pointer).

### Code

```javascript
function minSubArrayLen(target, nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let minLength = Infinity;
    let start = 0;
    let sum = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        sum += nums[end];

        while (sum >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
            sum -= nums[start];
            start++;
        }
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? 0 : minLength;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minSubArrayLen(7, [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3])); // Output: 2
console.log(minSubArrayLen(4, [1, 4, 4]));           // Output: 1
console.log(minSubArrayLen(11, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])); // Output: 0
```

The above implementation correctly uses the sliding window technique to determine the minimal length subarray while maintaining optimal time complexity.
