[Leetcode 2957. Remove Adjacent Almost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2957)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, remove all instances of adjacent almost-equal characters from the string. Two characters are considered almost equal if the absolute difference of their values in the ASCII table is less than or equal to `k`. Perform this removal iteratively until you can no longer remove any characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - This helps in understanding if the input size is manageable and if an efficient algorithm is needed for larger inputs.
   
2. **What should be returned if all characters are removed?**
   - Should we return an empty string, `null`, or some specific value?
   
3. **Is the comparison case-sensitive?**
   - This clarifies if 'a' and 'A' should be treated differently or not.
   
4. **Can the string contain non-alphabetic characters?**
   - This determines if we need to consider ASCII values beyond just alphabetic characters.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate with a stack:**
   - Use a stack to help in removing the adjacent almost-equal characters. The stack allows us to keep track of the characters and easily check the condition for removal.
   
2. **Check Conditions:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - Push characters onto the stack.
   - If the character at the top of the stack and the current character are almost-equal (i.e., their ASCII difference is less than or equal to `k`), pop the stack to remove the character.

3. **Continue Until Stable:**
   - Continue this process iteratively until no more characters can be removed in a full pass through the string.

4. **Convert Stack to String:**
   - After the iterations, combine the characters remaining in the stack to form the final string.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity: O(n) per iteration.**
  - Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once per complete iteration through the string.
- **Number of Iterations:**
  - The number of iterations can vary, but in the worst case, it will still be linear in terms of the input size because each pass through the string further reduces the number of possible removals.

### Code
  
```javascript
function removeAlmostEqualCharacters(s, k) {
    let changes = true;
    
    while (changes) {
        changes = false;
        let stack = [];

        for (let char of s) {
            if (stack.length > 0 && Math.abs(char.charCodeAt(0) - stack[stack.length - 1].charCodeAt(0)) <= k) {
                stack.pop();
                changes = true;
            } else {
                stack.push(char);
            }
        }

        s = stack.join('');
    }

    return s;
}

// Example usage:
let str = "abcdeedcba";
let k = 1;
console.log(removeAlmostEqualCharacters(str, k));  // Output will depend on the example string.
```

### Time Complexity Analysis
- **Initial Processing: O(n)** for the linear scan of the string.
- **Stack Operations: O(n)** since each character is pushed and popped at most once per iteration.
  
The complexity per iteration is linear, and since this is iterated until no more changes are made, the overall complexity is linear with respect to the total number of operations performed.

This makes the approach efficient for reasonably sized input strings.
