[Leetcode 2786. Visit Array Positions to Maximize Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2786)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. You have to move to **exactly one** element in `nums` starting at the **first** element. Then, you must move to some other element in the array **exactly** `x` positions to the right or to the left (i.e., from index `i` to `i + x` or from index `i` to `i - x`). Continue in this manner, moving exactly `x` positions each time, until you reach an element that cannot be moved to.

Your goal is to find the maximum **score** you can get. The score is defined as the sum of all array values at the positions you visited.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the array and the values within the array?
   - Typically, constraints are provided in the full problem description to help with optimizing the solution.

2. **Edge Cases:** Are there any particular edge cases we should consider such as a very small array, or a case where `x` is larger than the array size?

3. **Negative Numbers:** Can `nums` contain negative numbers, and should they be considered part of the score?

4. **Movement Limitations:** If you start at the first element and cannot immediately move `x` positions, do we simply consider the score as the first element?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to use dynamic programming with memoization. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Memoization:** Use a memo array to store the maximum score from each position so that we don't recompute scores for the same positions multiple times.
2. **Recursive Function:** Define a recursive function that tries to move both left and right by `x` positions and explores the maximum score obtainable from those moves.
3. **Base Case:** If the move leads to an out-of-bound index, terminate that path.
4. **Initialization:** Start from the first element and initiate the recursive function.

## Code

```javascript
var visitArrayPositionsToMaximizeScore = function(nums, x) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const memo = Array(n).fill(null);

    const dfs = (index) => {
        // If index is out of bounds, return 0
        if (index < 0 || index >= n) return 0;
        
        // If we have already computed the result from this index, return it
        if (memo[index] !== null) return memo[index];

        // Compute the maximum score if we move x positions to the right or left
        const scoreRight = (index + x < n) ? nums[index] + dfs(index + x) : nums[index];
        const scoreLeft = (index - x >= 0) ? nums[index] + dfs(index - x) : nums[index];

        // Memoize and return the maximum score from both potential moves
        memo[index] = Math.max(scoreRight, scoreLeft);
        return memo[index];
    }

    // Start from the first element
    return dfs(0);
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const x = 3;
console.log(visitArrayPositionsToMaximizeScore(nums, x));
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) -- In the worst case, we visit each element exactly once while memoizing results.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) -- Due to the memo array storing results for each element.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum score achievable by visiting array positions `x` apart.
