[Leetcode 399. Evaluate Division](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l399)
### Problem Statement

You are given equations in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number representing the division result between `A` and `B`. Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

**The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the equations will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.**

Example:
```jsx
Input: equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
       values = [2.0, 3.0],
       queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]
Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be disconnected variables for which there is no relationship given?**
   - Yes, in such cases, the answer should be `-1.0`.
   
2. **Can we assume that input size is within a manageable range for graph traversal algorithms?**
   - Yes, the problem's constraints typically allow for graph-based approaches.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the equations as a graph where each variable is a node.
   - An edge from node `A` to `B` with a weight `k` means `A/B = k`.
   - Also, add the inverse relation `B/A = 1/k` to fully represent the relationship.

2. **Graph Traversal:**
   - To evaluate a query `A/B`, we can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from node `A` to node `B`.
   - If such a path exists, the product of edge weights along this path will give the desired result.
   - If no path exists, return `-1.0`.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this:

```javascript
function calcEquation(equations, values, queries) {
    const graph = {};

    // Build the graph
    for (let i = 0; i < equations.length; i++) {
        const [A, B] = equations[i];
        const k = values[i];

        if (!graph[A]) graph[A] = [];
        if (!graph[B]) graph[B] = [];
        graph[A].push([B, k]);
        graph[B].push([A, 1 / k]);
    }

    function dfs(curr, target, visited) {
        if (!(curr in graph) || !(target in graph)) return -1.0;
        if (curr === target) return 1.0;

        visited.add(curr);

        for (const [neighbor, value] of graph[curr]) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                const temp = dfs(neighbor, target, visited);
                if (temp != -1.0) {
                    return temp * value;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1.0;
    }

    const results = [];

    for (const [A, B] of queries) {
        if (A in graph && B in graph) {
            results.push(dfs(A, B, new Set()));
        } else {
            results.push(-1.0);
        }
    }

    return results;
}

// Example usage:
const equations = [["a", "b"], ["b", "c"]];
const values = [2.0, 3.0];
const queries = [["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"]];
console.log(calcEquation(equations, values, queries)); // Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** O(E) where E is the number of equations.
- **Queries Evaluation:** Each query requires traversing the graph, leading to O(Q * (V + E)), where Q is the number of queries, V is the number of variables, and E is the number of edges.

**The overall complexity is influenced by the number of queries and the interconnectedness of the variables.**
