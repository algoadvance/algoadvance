[Leetcode 982. Triples with Bitwise AND Equal To Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l982)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, return the number of triples `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and the bitwise AND of the three elements `arr[i]`, `arr[j]`, and `arr[k]` is equal to zero.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output Formats**:
    - **Input**: An integer array `arr` where each element `arr[i]` is a non-negative integer.
    - **Output**: An integer representing the number of valid triples `(i, j, k)`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What is the range of values for the elements in `arr`?
    - What is the maximum length of the array `arr`?
    - Are all elements guaranteed to be non-negative?

3. **Examples**:
    - For `arr = [2, 1, 3]`: The valid triples are `[(2, 1, 3)]`, and the number of such triples is `1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we should:

1. **Understand the nature of bitwise AND**:
    - The bitwise AND operation outputs `1` only if both corresponding bits of two operands are `1`.
    - The goal is to find triples where `arr[i] & arr[j] & arr[k] == 0`, which means that for at least one bit position, all corresponding bits from `arr[i]`, `arr[j]`, and `arr[k]` must be `0`.

2. **Combination Generation**:
    - We need to generate all possible triples `(i, j, k)`.
    - Check if the bitwise AND of these three numbers equals zero.

3. **Optimization Considerations**:
    - Direct generation of all triples will have a time complexity of `O(n^3)` which may not be feasible for larger arrays.
    - Consider using memoization or preprocessing to efficiently determine the possible ANDs.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
function countTriplets(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let count = 0;

    // Use a map to store the frequency of AND results of all pairs
    const pairAndCount = new Map();

    // Generate all pairs and count their AND results
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            let andResult = arr[i] & arr[j];
            if (pairAndCount.has(andResult)) {
                pairAndCount.set(andResult, pairAndCount.get(andResult) + 1);
            } else {
                pairAndCount.set(andResult, 1);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check triples
    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (let [andResult, freq] of pairAndCount) {
            if ((andResult & arr[k]) === 0) {
                count += freq;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(countTriplets([2, 1, 3])); // Output: 12
```

### Explanation

- **Pair Generation**: First, we generate all pairs `(arr[i], arr[j])` and calculate their bitwise AND, storing the frequency distribution in a map (`pairAndCount`).
- **Triple Checking**: For each element in array `arr[k]`, we check if it can form a valid triple with any of the AND results stored in the map.
- **Complexity Reduction**: The process involves combining **pre-processing** and **lookup** steps to reduce the overall complexity from straightforward `O(n^3)` to an efficient solution.

### Time Complexity

- **Pair Generation (Preprocessing)**: `O(n^2)`
- **Triple Checking**: `O(n * number of unique pairs)` where `number of unique pairs` is bounded by `O(n^2)` in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n^2)`.
