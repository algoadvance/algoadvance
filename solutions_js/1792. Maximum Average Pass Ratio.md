[Leetcode 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1792)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `classes`, where each `classes[i] = [pass_i, total_i]` represents a class of students. Here, `pass_i` denotes the number of students who passed the ith class, and `total_i` denotes the total number of students in the ith class. You are also given an integer `extraStudents` representing the number of additional students that you can add to these classes.

You want to maximize the average pass ratio after assigning all the extra students. The pass ratio of a class is defined as the ratio of the number of students who pass the class to the total number of students in the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of classes.

Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after adding the extra students.

#### Example:
```text
Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
Output: 0.78333

Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
Output: 0.53485
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the number of passing students exceed the total number of students?
   - **A**: No, the number of passing students cannot exceed the total number of students.

2. **Q**: Are `pass_i` and `total_i` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - **A**: Yes, both `pass_i` and `total_i` are guaranteed to be non-negative integers.

3. **Q**: Is there a limit to the value of `extraStudents`?
   - **A**: There is no explicitly stated limit, but it should be treated based on practical constraints considering the problem context.

### Strategy

1. **Heap (Priority Queue)**:
   - Use a max-heap to prioritize which class to assign the next student to. The idea is to always add the student to the class where the addition will produce the greatest increase in the pass ratio.
   - For this, compute the difference in pass ratio that adding an extra student would produce for each class and use this to drive the priority.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   1. Initialize a max-heap, where each entry is a tuple containing the negative impact (to simulate max in min-heap) of adding one extra student and the index of the class.
   2. Pop the class with the highest impact from the heap, update the pass and total, and calculate the new impact of adding another student.
   3. Push this updated impact back into the heap.
   4. Repeat this process until all extra students have been added.
   5. Compute the final average pass ratio.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} classes
 * @param {number} extraStudents
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxAverageRatio = function(classes, extraStudents) {
    // Priority Queue to get the class with max impact of adding a student
    class MaxHeap {
        constructor() {
            this.heap = [];
        }

        push(value) {
            this.heap.push(value);
            this._siftUp();
        }

        pop() {
            if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
            const top = this.heap[0];
            this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
            this._siftDown();
            return top;
        }

        _siftUp() {
            let nodeIdx = this.heap.length - 1;
            while (nodeIdx > 0) {
                let parentIdx = Math.floor((nodeIdx - 1) / 2);
                if (this.heap[nodeIdx][0] <= this.heap[parentIdx][0]) break;
                [this.heap[nodeIdx], this.heap[parentIdx]] = [this.heap[parentIdx], this.heap[nodeIdx]];
                nodeIdx = parentIdx;
            }
        }

        _siftDown() {
            let nodeIdx = 0;
            const length = this.heap.length;
            while (true) {
                let leftChildIdx = 2 * nodeIdx + 1;
                let rightChildIdx = 2 * nodeIdx + 2;
                let swapIdx = null;

                if (leftChildIdx < length && this.heap[leftChildIdx][0] > this.heap[nodeIdx][0]) {
                    swapIdx = leftChildIdx;
                }
                if (rightChildIdx < length &&
                    ((swapIdx === null && this.heap[rightChildIdx][0] > this.heap[nodeIdx][0]) ||
                     (swapIdx !== null && this.heap[rightChildIdx][0] > this.heap[leftChildIdx][0]))) {
                    swapIdx = rightChildIdx;
                }
                if (swapIdx === null) break;

                [this.heap[nodeIdx], this.heap[swapIdx]] = [this.heap[swapIdx], this.heap[nodeIdx]];
                nodeIdx = swapIdx;
            }
        }
    }

    const heap = new MaxHeap();

    const calcImpact = (pass, total) => {
        const before = pass / total;
        const after = (pass + 1) / (total + 1);
        return after - before;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < classes.length; i++) {
        const [pass, total] = classes[i];
        const impact = calcImpact(pass, total);
        heap.push([impact, pass, total]);
    }

    while (extraStudents > 0) {
        const [impact, pass, total] = heap.pop();
        const newPass = pass + 1;
        const newTotal = total + 1;
        const newImpact = calcImpact(newPass, newTotal);
        heap.push([newImpact, newPass, newTotal]);
        extraStudents--;
    }

    let sumRatios = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < heap.heap.length; i++) {
        const [impact, pass, total] = heap.heap[i];
        sumRatios += (pass / total);
    }

    return sumRatios / classes.length;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is as follows:
- **Heap Operations**: (Insertion/Extraction): O(log k), where k is the number of classes.
- **Initialization of Heap**: O(k)
- **Total Operations for Adding Students**: O(extraStudents * log k)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately O((extraStudents + k) * log k).

This approach is efficient for typical constraints and ensures the addition of extra students maximizes the average pass ratio.
