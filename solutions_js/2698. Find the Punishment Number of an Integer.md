[Leetcode 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2698)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the punishment number of `n`. The punishment number of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of the first `n` positive integers that can be split into parts such that the sum of those parts equals the original integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum value of `n` we need to handle?
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be a single integer representing the punishment number?
3. **Boundary Conditions**: How should the function behave for the smallest input values, e.g., `n = 1`?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**: This problem involves both partitioning and summing the parts, and checking if the sum equals the original integer. Then, squaring such integers and summing these squares.
2. **Splitting Parts**: To split a number into parts and check their sum, we can use recursion or backtracking.
3. **Sum of Squares**: Once we identify qualifying numbers, we can calculate their sum of squares.

### Code

Here's a step-by-step implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Helper function to check if a number can be split into parts that sum to target.
 * @param {string} numStr - The string representation of remaining number to process.
 * @param {number} target - The target sum we need to match.
 * @returns {boolean} - Returns true if valid split is found, else false.
 */
function canSplitIntoParts(numStr, target) {
    if (target === 0 && numStr.length === 0) return true;
    if (numStr.length === 0 || target < 0) return false;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= numStr.length; i++) {
        let part = parseInt(numStr.substring(0, i), 10);
        if (canSplitIntoParts(numStr.substring(i), target - part)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

/**
 * Returns the punishment number for the given integer n.
 * @param {number} n - The given integer.
 * @return {number} - The punishment number.
 */
function punishmentNumber(n) {
    let punishmentSum = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let square = i * i;
        if (canSplitIntoParts(square.toString(), i)) {
            punishmentSum += square;
        }
    }

    return punishmentSum;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(punishmentNumber(10)); // Example output based on the problem's requirement
```

### Time Complexity

1. **canSplitIntoParts Function**: The worst-case time complexity of this function is \(O(2^m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the number string because each digit could either be part of the current partition or start a new one.
2. **Overall Complexity**: We run `canSplitIntoParts` for each number from 1 to `n`, thus giving a rough overall time complexity of \(O(n \cdot 2^d)\), where `d` is the number of digits in \(n^2\). This can grow quite quickly, so optimizations may be necessary for very large `n`.

This provides a comprehensive solution to the problem of finding the punishment number as described.
