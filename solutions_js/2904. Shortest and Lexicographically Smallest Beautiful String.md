[Leetcode 2904. Shortest and Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2904)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consists of lowercase English letters and an integer `k`, your task is to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string that is strictly greater than `s` and does not contain any substring of the same character repeated thrice consecutively or any pair of distinct characters repeated consecutively as a substring. 

Beautiful strings are defined that do not contain:
- Substrings like "aaa", "bbb", ..., "zzz".
- Substrings like "xyx", "yxy", ..., where `x` and `y` are distinct characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
2. What are the possible values of integer `k`?
3. Can `s` be an empty string?
4. If there is no such string that satisfies the conditions, should we return an empty string or some specific value?
5. Are only lowercase English characters allowed in the string `s`?

### Strategy
1. **Iterate from Right to Left:** Start from the last position of the string `s` and try to increment the character at each position, ensuring that the next character is lexicographically greater and fulfilling the constraints.
2. **Check Constraints:** After each incremental step, ensure that the resulting substring from the modified position does not have the forbidden patterns.
3. **Backtrack if Necessary:** If it is not possible to generate a valid string by just incrementing the current character and ensuring constraints, backtrack to the previous character.
4. **Form the Smallest Possible String:** Once a valid position is found by incrementing chars, fill the subsequent positions with the smallest lexicographically possible characters that also satisfy the constraints.

### Code
Here is a code snippet to solve the problem:

```javascript
const getNextChar = (char, k) => {
    const code = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
    if (code < k) return String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt(0) + code);
    return '';
}

const isValid = (s, i) => {
    return (i < 1 || s[i] !== s[i - 1]) && 
           (i < 2 || !(s[i] === s[i - 1] && s[i - 1] === s[i - 2])) && 
           (i < 2 || !(s[i] === s[i - 2]));
}

const smallestBeautifulString = (s, k) => {
    s = s.split('');
    let n = s.length;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let newChar = getNextChar(s[i], k);
        while (newChar && newChar <= 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + k - 1 && !newChar) {
            s[i] = newChar;
            if (isValid(s, i)) {
                for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    let nextValidChar = 'a';
                    while (!isValid(s, j)) nextValidChar = getNextChar(nextValidChar, k);
                    s[j] = nextValidChar;
                }
                return s.join('');
            } 
            newChar = getNextChar(newChar, k);
        }
    }
    return '';
};

// Example usage:
let s = "abc";
let k = 3;
console.log(smallestBeautifulString(s, k));  // Output: a valid beautiful string greater than "abc"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is mainly driven by:
1. Incrementing through characters from the back to the front, which is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
2. For each position, checking subsequent constraints which is also `O(n)` in the worst case.

Therefore, the time complexity is approximately `O(n^2)` in the worst case scenario. Such efficient handling ensures that even with larger strings, the function performs within acceptable bounds.
