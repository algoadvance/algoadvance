[Leetcode 2646. Minimize the Total Price of the Trips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2646)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by `n` nodes. You are also given an array of edges `edges[i]` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]`, which represents an undirected edge between node `ui` and node `vi`, and an array `price` where `price[i]` is the value of the ith node. Each trip between two nodes can be repeated more than once. You are given an array `trips` where `trips[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, representing a trip from node `start_i` to node `end_i`.

The total price of a trip is the sum of prices of all nodes visited during the trip, including the start and the end nodes. If a trip passes through some nodes more than once, you sum their prices every time they are visited.

However, for optimization reasons, you are allowed to choose some nodes and halve its price (reduce it by half, considering integer division).

You need to find the minimum total price of all the trips after optimally halving the price of some nodes exactly once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `n` be as large as 10^5 nodes?
2. Are there any constraints on the trip count or the size of the `price` array?
3. Is integer division rounding down (e.g., 5 / 2 = 2)?
4. Do all nodes belong to one single connected component?
5. What are the bounds for the `price` array values?

## Code

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number[]} price
 * @param {number[][]} trips
 * @return {number}
 */
function minimizeTotalPrice(n, edges, price, trips) {
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const nodeTripCount = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }

    const dfs = (start, end) => {
        const stack = [[start, [start]]];
        const visited = new Set(start);

        while (stack.length > 0) {
            const [node, path] = stack.pop();
            if (node === end) return path;
            for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    stack.push([neighbor, path.concat(neighbor)]);
                }
            }
        }
        return [];
    };

    for (const [start, end] of trips) {
        const path = dfs(start, end);
        for (const node of path) {
            nodeTripCount[node]++;
        }
    }

    let totalSum = price.reduce((sum, p, i) => sum + p * nodeTripCount[i], 0);
    let maxReduction = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nodeTripCount[i] > 0) {
            const originalCost = price[i] * nodeTripCount[i];
            const reducedCost = Math.floor(price[i] / 2) * nodeTripCount[i];
            maxReduction = Math.max(maxReduction, originalCost - reducedCost);
        }
    }

    return totalSum - maxReduction;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Graph Construction**: Create an adjacency list from the `edges` input.
2. **DFS Path Finding**: Use a depth-first search to find the path between each start and end in `trips`.
3. **Node Frequency Counting**: Track how many times each node is visited in all trips.
4. **Calculate Initial Cost**: Compute the total cost without any halving.
5. **Optimization by Halving**: For each node, calculate the maximum possible reduction if its price is halved and find the node that offers the maximum reduction.
6. **Result Calculation**: Subtract the maximum reduction from the initial total cost.

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the graph takes O(n + m) where `m` is the length of `edges`.
- Each DFS can take up to O(n + m) in the worst-case scenario (if the graph is dense or linear and all nodes are involved).
- Counting node trips takes O(n * k) where `k` is the number of trips.
- Overall, this approach has a time complexity of approximately O(n * k), considering the graph and DFS combined.

Feel free to ask if you have any specific constraint or detail to adjust the solution further.
