[Leetcode 2418. Sort the People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2418)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `names` and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the `i`-th person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

Example 1:
```
Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The tallest person is Bob with height 185, followed by Alice and the other Bob with height 150.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple people with the same height? 
   - The heights array consists of distinct positive integers, so no. 
2. Can the names be empty strings?
   - The problem does not specify, but for this solution, we will assume names are non-empty strings.
3. How large can the input arrays be?
   - Typical constraints need to be considered, and we should aim for an efficient solution.

## Strategy
1. Combine the `names` and `heights` arrays into a single array of objects where each object contains a name and a height.
2. Sort this combined array based on the height property in descending order.
3. Extract the sorted names from this array.

## Code
```javascript
function sortPeople(names, heights) {
    // Combine names and heights into a single array of objects
    let people = names.map((name, index) => ({ name, height: heights[index] }));
    
    // Sort based on height in descending order
    people.sort((a, b) => b.height - a.height);
    
    // Extract the sorted names
    return people.map(person => person.name);
}

// Example 1
console.log(sortPeople(["Mary", "John", "Emma"], [180, 165, 170])); // Output: ["Mary", "Emma", "John"]

// Example 2
console.log(sortPeople(["Alice", "Bob", "Bob"], [155, 185, 150])); // Output: ["Bob", "Alice", "Bob"]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Combining arrays**: O(n) where n is the length of the input arrays.
- **Sorting**: O(n log n) since sorting dominates the time complexity.
- **Extracting names**: O(n).

The overall time complexity is O(n log n).
