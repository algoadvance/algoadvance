[Leetcode 1550. Three Consecutive Odds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1550)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the size range of the array?
    - What values can the elements of the array take (e.g., negative numbers, range limit)?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the output be a boolean indicating the presence of three consecutive odd numbers?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should the function handle edge cases such as arrays with less than three elements?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a counter to track the consecutive odd numbers found.

2. **Iteration**:
    - Traverse through the array.
    - For each element, check if it is odd (`arr[i] % 2 !== 0`).
    - If it is odd, increment the counter.
    - If it is not odd, reset the counter to zero.
    - If the counter reaches three at any point, return `true`.

3. **Completion**:
    - If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm needs to iterate through each element of the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the counter.

### Code

```javascript
function threeConsecutiveOdds(arr) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num % 2 !== 0) { // Check if the number is odd
            count++;
            if (count === 3) {
                return true;
            }
        } else {
            count = 0; // Reset counter if number is not odd
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Explanation

- The function `threeConsecutiveOdds` takes an array `arr` as input.
- It initializes a variable `count` to zero, to keep track of consecutive odd numbers.
- It iterates over each element in the array:
  - If the element is odd, it increments `count`.
  - If `count` reaches three, it returns `true` immediately, meaning three consecutive odds have been found.
  - If the element is not odd, it resets `count` to zero.
- If the loop finishes and no three consecutive odd numbers are found, it returns `false`.

This strategy ensures the solution is efficient and easy to understand.
