[Leetcode 2044. Count Number of Maximum Bitwise](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2044)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subset of `nums` is **any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements from `nums`**. Return the number of **non-empty subsets** in which the **bitwise OR** of all the elements is equal to the **maximum bitwise OR** of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in `nums` always non-negative integers?**
   Yes.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   No, as the problem explicitly asks for non-empty subsets.

3. **Should we consider performance optimizations for very large inputs?**
   Yes, considering that we might need to generate subsets, which can be computationally expensive with large arrays.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. **Calculate the maximum bitwise OR value of the entire array `nums`.** This value will serve as a reference.
2. **Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all subsets** and count those whose bitwise OR equals the maximum bitwise OR value.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Compute the maximum bitwise OR value for `nums`**:
   - Initialize `max_or` to 0.
   - Iterate through `nums` and update `max_or` with the OR operation between `max_or` and each number in the array.

2. **Use recursive backtracking to explore all subsets**:
   - Use a helper function that backtracks through the array, maintaining the current bitwise OR value of the subset.
   - If the current bitwise OR value equals `max_or` and the subset is non-empty, increment the count.
   - Continue to explore other elements to make further subsets.

### Code

```javascript
function countMaxOrSubsets(nums) {
    const maxOr = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc | num, 0);
    let count = 0;
    
    // Helper function to perform backtracking
    function backtrack(index, currentOr) {
        if (index === nums.length) {
            if (currentOr === maxOr) {
                count++;
            }
            return;
        }
        
        // Include nums[index] in subset
        backtrack(index + 1, currentOr | nums[index]);
        
        // Exclude nums[index] from subset
        backtrack(index + 1, currentOr);
    }
    
    // Start backtracking from index 0 and initial OR as 0
    backtrack(0, 0);
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n)
  - Where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element has two choices (being included or not included), leading to `2^n` subsets.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The recursive stack will go at most `n` calls deep.

This solution is feasible for relatively small arrays (`n` in the range of 15-20), but would be expensive for very large arrays due to the exponential growth of subsets.
