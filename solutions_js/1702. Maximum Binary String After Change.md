[Leetcode 1702. Maximum Binary String After Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1702)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `binary`, you can apply each of the following operations any number of times:
1. If the number contains the substring `"00"`, you can replace it with `"10"`.
2. If the number contains the substring `"10"`, you can replace it with `"01"`.

Return the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations. 

**Example:**
```
Input: binary = "000110"
Output: "111011"
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= binary.length <= 10^5
- `binary` consists only of '0' and '1'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What does a "maximum binary string" mean in this context?**
   - It means the lexicographically largest binary string possible after performing the given operations.

2. **What is the expected output if the input is already the maximum possible binary string?**
   - The output should be the same as the input string.

3. **Are there any specific edge cases to consider?**
   - Yes, when the binary string consists only of '1's.

## Strategy

To maximize the binary string:
- Our aim is to push as many '1's as possible to the front of the string.
- Count the number of '0's and '1's between the first '0' from the left and the last '0' from the right.
- Ensure all '1's to the left of the first '0' stay intact and all '0's except one are converted to '1's.
- The only '0' left should be the trailing '0' flanked by all '1's.

**Step-by-step approach:**
1. Identify the number of leading '1's.
2. Count the number of '0's and '1's from the first '0' till the end of the array.
3. Construct the result string:
   - Preserve the leading '1's.
   - Convert all `n-1` '0's to '1's and leave one '0' towards the end.
   - Append the remaining '1's to the end, if any.

## Code

```javascript
function maximumBinaryString(binary) {
    const n = binary.length;
    if (n <= 1) return binary;

    let firstZero = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (binary[i] === '0') {
            firstZero = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // If no '0' found, return the original string
    if (firstZero === -1) return binary;
    
    let zeroCount = 0;
    let oneCount = 0;
    for (let i = firstZero; i < n; i++) {
        if (binary[i] === '0') {
            zeroCount++;
        } else {
            oneCount++;
        }
    }
    
    // Build the result string
    let result = '1'.repeat(firstZero) + '1'.repeat(zeroCount - 1) + '0' + '1'.repeat(oneCount);
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(maximumBinaryString("000110")); // Output: "111011"
```

This approach ensures that all operations allowed are utilized to create the lexicographically largest string possible.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the binary string, since we traverse the string a constant number of times to count characters and construct the result string. This is efficient given the constraints.
