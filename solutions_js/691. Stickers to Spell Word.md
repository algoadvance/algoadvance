[Leetcode 691. Stickers to Spell Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l691)
### Problem Statement

We are given a collection of `n` stickers. Each sticker has a string on it. 

You are also given a target string. You want to spell out the target string by using the given stickers. You can use each sticker as many times as you want and can reorder them if necessary.

Output the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the target. If the target cannot be spelled out, return -1.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the stickers contain uppercase letters?**
   - No, it is mentioned that the inputs are lowercase letters.

2. **Can the stickers contain repeated characters?**
   - Yes, they can.

3. **Is the target string always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that.

4. **Do all stickers have at least one character?**
   - Yes, each sticker has at least one character.

5. **Can we assume that the length of each sticker and the target will be reasonably small?**
   - Yes, typical constraints for these types of problems can be assumed, but optimization is still necessary.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count:** First, build a frequency count of each character in each sticker.
2. **Top-Down DP with Memoization:** Use a top-down approach with memoization where the state is represented by the remaining characters to cover.
3. **Recursive Function:** Create a recursive function to determine the minimum number of stickers required to cover the remaining characters of the target string.
4. **Memoization:** Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code

Here is a potential solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minStickers(stickers, target) {
    const m = stickers.length;
    const stickerCount = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(26).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (const char of stickers[i]) {
            stickerCount[i][char.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
        }
    }

    const memo = {};

    const helper = (target) => {
        if (target in memo) return memo[target];

        const targetCount = Array(26).fill(0);
        for (const char of target) {
            targetCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
        }

        let ans = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
        for (const sticker of stickerCount) {
            if (sticker[target[0].charCodeAt(0) - 97] === 0) continue;

            const newTarget = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (targetCount[i] > 0) {
                    for (let j = 0; j < targetCount[i] - sticker[i]; j++) {
                        newTarget.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 97));
                    }
                }
            }

            const next = helper(newTarget.join(''));
            if (next !== -1) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, next + 1);
            }
        }

        memo[target] = ans === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? -1 : ans;
        return memo[target];
    };

    return helper(target);
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach can be challenging to calculate exactly but can be discussed in terms of the problem size:

- Assume the combined length of all sticker strings is `S`.
- Assume the length of the target string is `T`.
- Because we are using a top-down memoized approach, every unique state of the problem (represented by the remaining characters in the target) is evaluated at most once.
- The worst-case scenario involves evaluating each possible combination of remaining characters in the target, which gives us a complexity related to `O(2^T)` states multiplied by the time to process each state (related to `O(S)`).

This makes the approach feasible within typical constraint bounds as long as `T` and `S` are reasonably small, but the worst-case theoretical bound remains high, highlighting the efficiency gains achieved by memoization.
