[Leetcode 1487. Making File Names Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1487)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `names` where each name is a folder name. Your task is to ensure that no two folders have the same name. If a potential duplicate name is found, you should append a number in parentheses (k) to the end of the name to make it unique (in the smallest possible k such that the result becomes unique). Return an array of the new names.

### Example
```text
Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]

Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes(1)"]

Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]

Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of the folder names?
   - **A**: The length of each folder name is between 1 and 100 characters.
2. **Q**: Can folder names contain any characters such as numbers and symbols?
   - **A**: Yes, folder names can contain any characters, including numbers and parentheses.
3. **Q**: Is the input case-sensitive?
   - **A**: Yes, folder names are case-sensitive.

## Strategy

1. Use a hash map (dictionary) to keep track of the names we encounter and how many times they have been used.
2. For each name in the list:
    - If the name is not in the hash map, add it directly and set its count to 1.
    - If the name is already in the hash map, determine the smallest possible number `k` for which `name(k)` is not already used:
        1. Append `(k)` to the name to form a new candidate name.
        2. Increment `k` until a unique name is found.
        3. Add this new name to the result list.
        4. Update the hash map with the new name and its corresponding counter.
3. Return the list of unique names.

## Code

```javascript
function getFolderNames(names) {
    let nameCountMap = new Map();
    let result = [];
    
    for (let name of names) {
        if (!nameCountMap.has(name)) {
            // The name is unique, add it to the result and update the map
            result.push(name);
            nameCountMap.set(name, 1); // Start counting from 1 for potential future duplicates
        } else {
            let count = nameCountMap.get(name);
            let newName = `${name}(${count})`;
            while (nameCountMap.has(newName)) {
                count++;
                newName = `${name}(${count})`;
            }
            result.push(newName);
            nameCountMap.set(newName, 1);
            nameCountMap.set(name, count + 1); // Update the original name's counter for future duplicates
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes"];
console.log(getFolderNames(names)); // Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes(1)"]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n \* m)**, where:

- **n** is the number of names in the input array.
- **m** is the average length of the names.

The space complexity is **O(n)** because we need a hash map to store the names and their counts.
