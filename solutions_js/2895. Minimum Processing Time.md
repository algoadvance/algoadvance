[Leetcode 2895. Minimum Processing Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2895)
## Problem Statement:
You are given `n` processors and `n * m` tasks. Each processor can handle exactly `m` tasks. You are given an integer array `processorTime` of length `n` where `processorTime[i]` is the time the `i`-th processor needs to complete all the tasks assigned to it. You are also given an integer array `tasks` of length `n * m` where `tasks[j]` is the amount of time the `j`-th task takes to process.

Assign tasks to processors such that the maximum processing time of any processor is minimized. Return the minimum time needed to process all the tasks.

### Example:
```text
Input: processorTime = [8,10], tasks = [2,2,3,1,8,7]
Output: 16
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n, m <= 200`
- `len(processorTime) == n`
- `len(tasks) == n * m`
- `1 <= processorTime[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= tasks[j] <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can multiple processors have the same processing time?
2. Should the tasks be assigned to processors such that we minimize the time any processor is idle?
3. If a task cannot be completed by a processor, should we distribute the tasks like round-robin or is any distribution allowed?

## Strategy:
1. **Sort the Tasks**: Begin by sorting the tasks in descending order.
2. **Sort Processors by Processing Time**: We also need to sort the processors by their processing time in ascending order.
3. **Greedy Assignment**: Use a greedy approach to assign the most time-consuming tasks to the busiest available processor.

## Code:
```javascript
var minProcessingTime = function(processorTime, tasks) {
    // Sort processor times in ascending order
    processorTime.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    // Sort tasks in descending order
    tasks.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Initialize array to hold total times for each processor
    const processorTotalTimes = Array(processorTime.length).fill(0);
    
    let taskIndex = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < processorTime.length; i++) {
        // Each processor should handle exactly `m` tasks
        for (let j = 0; j < processorTime.length; j++) {
            // Assign next available task
            processorTotalTimes[i] += tasks[taskIndex];
            taskIndex++;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate total times and return the maximum processing time
    let maxTime = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < processorTime.length; i++) {
        maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, processorTime[i] + processorTotalTimes[i]);
    }
    
    return maxTime;
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Sorting Processor Times**: O(n log n)
- **Sorting Tasks**: O((n * m) log (n * m))
- **Assignment**: O(n * m)

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting steps, so:
- **Overall Complexity**: O((n * m) log (n * m))
