[Leetcode 143. Reorder List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l143)
### Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list `L: L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln`,
reorder it to: `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What kind of linked list is provided? (Singly Linked List)
2. What is the range of possible sizes for the linked list?
3. What should be returned? (No return, the linked list should be modified in place)

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List**:
   Use a slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle of the list. Slow pointer moves one step at a time while fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   Split the list into two halves and reverse the second half.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**:
   Merge the two lists, alternating nodes from each half.

### Code
```javascript
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

var reorderList = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return;

    // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
    let slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
    let prev = null, curr = slow, temp;
    while (curr) {
        temp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }

    // Step 3: Merge the two halves
    let first = head, second = prev;
    while (second.next) {
        temp = first.next;
        first.next = second;
        first = temp;

        temp = second.next;
        second.next = first;
        second = temp;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the middle**: O(n)
- **Reversing the second half**: O(n)
- **Merging two halves**: O(n)

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)** where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.
