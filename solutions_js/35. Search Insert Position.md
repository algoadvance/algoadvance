[Leetcode 35. Search Insert Position](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l35)
## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of the list?
   - The list can have up to 10^4 elements.
   
2. What are the possible values for the target?
   - The target can be any integer, positive or negative.

3. Are there any duplicate values in the list?
   - No, the problem states that all integers in the array are distinct.

## Strategy

To solve this problem in `O(log n)` time complexity, we can use a binary search algorithm. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Set two pointers, `left` at 0 and `right` at the last index of the array.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Calculate the middle index.
   - If the target is equal to the middle element, return the middle index.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, adjust the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
3. **Insertion Point**: If the loop ends without finding the target, the `left` pointer will indicate the position where the target should be inserted.

## Code

```javascript
function searchInsert(nums, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is `O(log n)` because we halve the search space in each iteration. This meets the problem's requirement of logarithmic time complexity.
