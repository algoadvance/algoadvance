[Leetcode 848. Shifting Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l848)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer array `shifts` of the same length. We want to shift the characters of `s` to the right `shifts[i]` times for each index `i` (0-indexed). Shifting a character means moving it to the next letter in the alphabet (i.e., ‘a’ shifts to ‘b’, ‘b’ shifts to ‘c’, and so on, with ‘z’ shifting to ‘a’).

Return the final string after all such shifts to `s` are applied.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the characters in the string?**
   - Characters in the string `s` are always lowercase English letters.
2. **Can the shifts result in moving beyond 'z'?**
   - Yes, shifting should wrap around from 'z' back to 'a'.
3. **What are the constraints of the problem?**
   - The constraints could be as:
     - `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
     - `shifts.length == s.length`
     - `0 <= shifts[i] <= 10^9`
4. **Will the input always be valid?**
   - Yes, assume the input will always be valid according to the given constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Accumulate the Shifts**
   - Moving backwards through the `shifts` array, sum up all future shifts to determine the effective shift at each index. This means the last element's shift remains the same, and each previous element's shift is adjusted by adding the shifts after it.
   
2. **Apply the Shift**
   - For each character in the string `s`, shift it by the accumulated value at each index. This requires converting characters to their corresponding position in the alphabet, applying the shift including wrap-around, and then converting back to characters.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   1. Compute the effective shifts by iterating from the end of the array to the start.
   2. Apply the computed shifts to the characters in the string.
   3. Construct the final string from the shifted characters.

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Calculating the effective shifts takes `O(n)`, and applying these shifts to transform the string also takes `O(n)`.

### Code

```javascript
var shiftingLetters = function(s, shifts) {
    const n = s.length;
    let totalShift = 0;
    const resultArray = Array(n);

    // Compute the effective shifts by iterating from the end to the start
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        totalShift = (totalShift + shifts[i]) % 26;
        let newCharCode = (s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + totalShift) % 26; 
        resultArray[i] = String.fromCharCode(newCharCode + 'a'.charCodeAt(0));
    }
    
    // Join the array to form the result string
    return resultArray.join('');
};
```

This code effectively shifts the letters of the string `s` as specified in the `shifts` array and returns the new string.
