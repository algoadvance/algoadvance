[Leetcode 92. Reverse Linked List II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l92)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where `1 <= left <= right <= n` (`n` is the length of the linked list). Reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if `left` and `right` are the same?**
   - If `left` and `right` are the same, return the list as it is because there is nothing to reverse.
   
2. **Do we need to handle any edge cases for invalid inputs?**
   - We can assume the inputs are valid based on the constraints provided in the problem statement.

3. **What should be the structure of the linked list node?**
   - Generally, a linked list node is structured as follows in JavaScript:
     ```javascript
     function ListNode(val, next = null) {
         this.val = val;
         this.next = next;
     }
     ```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a dummy node to handle edge cases where the head might change.
   - Initialize pointers (`prev`, `current`, and `next`) to traverse and modify the list.
   
2. **Traverse to the left position**:
   - Move `prev` to immediately before the `left` position node.
   
3. **Reverse the sublist**:
   - Reverse the sublist from `left` to `right`. Use a loop to reverse the pointers in this range.
   
4. **Reconnect the reversed sublist**:
   - Connect the end of the reversed sublist to the node following `right`.
   - Connect the node before `left` to the start of the reversed sublist.
   
5. **Return the new head**:
   - Return the new head which might be different if the reversed part included the head.

### Code

Below is the JavaScript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

function reverseBetween(head, left, right) {
    if (left === right) return head;

    let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
    let prev = dummy;

    // Step 1: Traverse to the node just before the `left` position
    for (let i = 1; i < left; i++) {
        prev = prev.next;
    }

    let current = prev.next;
    let next = current.next;

    // Step 2: Reverse the sublist from `left` to `right`
    for (let i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
        current.next = next.next;
        next.next = prev.next;
        prev.next = next;
        next = current.next;
    }

    // Step 3: Return the new head of the list
    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we need to traverse the list initially to get to the node before `left` and then reverse the sublist in one pass.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we only use a few pointer variables for the reversal process.

This code should correctly reverse the linked list from position `left` to `right` and handle edge cases efficiently.
