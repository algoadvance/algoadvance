[Leetcode 342. Power of Four](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l342)
### Problem Statement

Determine whether an integer is a power of four. An integer n is a power of four if there exists an integer x such that n == 4^x.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the integer input? 
   - The input n can be any 32-bit signed integer.
   
2. **Output Requirements**: What should be returned?
   - Return `true` if n is a power of four, otherwise return `false`.

### Strategy

To determine if a given integer \( n \) is a power of four, we can use the following steps:

1. **Early Exit for Non-Positive Numbers**: If \( n \leq 0 \), return `false` (since powers of four are positive).
  
2. **Check If n is a Power of Two**: A number that is a power of four must also be a power of two. Therefore, we first check if \( n \) is a power of two by using the bitwise operation \( n \& (n-1) \). This will be 0 if \( n \) is a power of two.

3. **Check the Position of the Single `1` Bit**: For \( n \) to be a power of four, the single `1` bit in the binary representation of \( n \) must be at an even position (0-indexed). This can be checked using a bit mask such as `0x55555555` (which is `01010101010101010101010101010101` in binary).

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function to check if a number is a power of four:

```javascript
function isPowerOfFour(n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if n is a power of two
    if ((n & (n - 1)) !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the single 1 bit is in the correct position
    if ((n & 0x55555555) === 0) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isPowerOfFour(16)); // true
console.log(isPowerOfFour(5));  // false
console.log(isPowerOfFour(1));  // true
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \( O(1) \) because:
- Bitwise operations are constant time operations.
- We are using a fixed number of operations to determine if the number is a power of four.
