[Leetcode 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1232)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `coordinates`, `coordinates[i] = [x, y]`, where `[x, y]` represents the coordinates of a point in a 2D space. Determine if these points make a straight line in the 2D space.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the number of points be less than 2?
   - No, there will always be at least 2 points given.
   
2. Should I handle the case when the points are more than 2 meticulously or is there any shortcut for small number of points?
   - For 2 points, they always form a straight line. For more than 2 points, you'll need to check the condition for collinearity.

3. Will the coordinates be integers?
   - Yes, the coordinates are integers.

### Strategy

To determine if the given points lie on a straight line, we can use the concept of the slope. For three points to be collinear, the slope of the line between any two pairs of points should be the same.

The slope `m` between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given as:
\[ m = \frac{(y2 - y1)}{(x2 - x1)} \]

However, to avoid division (and potential division by zero), we can use the cross product method, which ensures we don't actually compute the slope but still determine collinearity:

For points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3),
\[ \text{(y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2)} \] should be equal to \[ \text{(y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)} \].

If the above determinant is zero for all sets of three consecutive points, then all the points lie on a straight line.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation to check if the points form a straight line:

```javascript
function checkStraightLine(coordinates) {
    if (coordinates.length <= 2) return true;
    
    let [x1, y1] = coordinates[0];
    let [x2, y2] = coordinates[1];

    for (let i = 2; i < coordinates.length; i++) {
        let [x, y] = coordinates[i];
        if ((y2 - y1) * (x - x2) !== (y - y2) * (x2 - x1)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of points given in the input. This is because we iterate once through the list of points.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

This solution efficiently checks if the given points are collinear using simple arithmetic operations, ensuring that it handles all edge cases involving straight line determination.
