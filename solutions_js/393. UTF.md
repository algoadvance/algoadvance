[Leetcode 393. UTF](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l393)
## Problem Statement
A character in UTF-8 encoding can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
1. For 1-byte character, the first bit is `0`, followed by its unicode code.
2. For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all `1`s, the n+1 bit is `0`, followed by n-1 bytes with the most significant two bits being `10`.

This means the first byte can be:
- `0xxxxxxx`  1-byte character
- `110xxxxx`  2-byte character
- `1110xxxx`  3-byte character
- `11110xxx`  4-byte character

All the other bytes take the form `10xxxxxx`.

Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: data = [197, 130, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: `197` in binary is `11000101`, and `130` in binary is `10000010`. These are valid 2-byte characters.

Input: data = [235, 140, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: `235` in binary is `11101011`, which represents a 3-byte character, but the next byte `140` is `10001100`, which isn't valid as the following byte.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do we need to handle input validation (e.g., non-integer values in input array)?
   - Assumption: No, the input array will contain only valid integers in the range [0, 255].
2. Is there a maximum size for the input array?
   - Assumption: No explicit maximum size, but it's a list of integers within typical input sizes.

## Strategy
1. Convert each integer to its binary representation padded to 8 bits.
2. Parse the first byte to determine the character length (1 to 4 bytes).
3. Validate each character's format and subsequent bytes based on UTF-8 rules:
   - For the first byte, check the leading bits to determine the expected total number of bytes.
   - For subsequent bytes, check they start with `10`.
4. Validate the entire list by iterating through it while keeping track of characters and respective byte sequences.

## Code

```javascript
function validUtf8(data) {
    let numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;

    // Masks to check the leading bits
    const mask1 = 1 << 7;  // 10000000
    const mask2 = 1 << 6;  // 01000000

    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        const byte = data[i];

        if (numberOfBytesToProcess === 0) {
            // Determine the number of bytes in the current UTF-8 character
            if ((byte & mask1) === 0) {
                // 1-byte character
                numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;
            } else {
                let mask = mask1;
                while ((byte & mask) !== 0) {
                    numberOfBytesToProcess++;
                    mask >>= 1;
                }

                // If the character length is either 1 or more than 4 this is invalid
                if (numberOfBytesToProcess === 1 || numberOfBytesToProcess > 4) {
                    return false;
                }

                numberOfBytesToProcess--;
            }
        } else {
            // The subsequent bytes must follow the pattern `10xxxxxx`
            if (!((byte & mask1) !== 0 && (byte & mask2) === 0)) {
                return false;
            }
            numberOfBytesToProcess--;
        }
    }

    return numberOfBytesToProcess === 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of integers in the input array. The function processes each byte once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the function uses a constant amount of extra space.
