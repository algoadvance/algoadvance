[Leetcode 2453. Destroy Sequential Targets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2453)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `space`. You need to destroy the targets in the following way:

- Start from any index `i` and destroy all targets `nums[i]`, `nums[i] + space`, `nums[i] + 2 * space`, and so on, as long as they exist in the array `nums`.

Return the minimum value of the starting index with which the maximum number of targets can be destroyed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the array `nums` unique?**
   - No, the values in `nums` can repeat.

2. **Is the array `nums` sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

3. **Can we start the destruction process with any index in `nums`?**
   - Yes, you can start from any index in the array.

4. **What should be returned in case of multiple minimum starting indices that result in the same maximum number of destroyed targets?**
   - If there are multiple such indices, we return the smallest index.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Remainder Groups:**
   - For each element `nums[i]`, compute `nums[i] % space`. This helps us to group elements that need to be destroyed together.

2. **Count Maximum Targets for Each Remainder:**
   - Use a map to count how many numbers belong to each remainder group.
   - Determine the maximum count of elements in any remainder group.

3. **Find the Minimum Starting Index:**
   - Iterate through the array and check for elements that belong to the largest remainder group.
   - Keep track of the smallest index among them.

### Code

```javascript
function destroyTargets(nums, space) {
    // Step 1: Create a map to store frequency of each remainder group
    const remainderMap = new Map();
    
    // Populate the remainderMap with counts
    nums.forEach(num => {
        const remainder = num % space;
        remainderMap.set(remainder, (remainderMap.get(remainder) || 0) + 1);
    });

    // Step 2: Find the maximum count of targets that can be destroyed
    const maxTargets = Math.max(...remainderMap.values());

    // Step 3: Find the minimum index with the maximum number of destroyable targets
    let minIndex = nums.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const remainder = nums[i] % space;
        if (remainderMap.get(remainder) === maxTargets) {
            minIndex = Math.min(minIndex, i);
        }
    }

    return minIndex;
}

// Test example
console.log(destroyTargets([1, 3, 5, 2, 4], 2)); // Expected output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Creating the Remainder Map:**
   - Computing `nums[i] % space` for all elements and updating the map: O(n).

2. **Finding Maximum Targets:**
   - Finding the maximum value in the map values: O(m) where `m` is the number of unique remainders.

3. **Finding Minimum Index:**
   - Iterating through the array to find the smallest index for the maximum count: O(n).

Thus, the total time complexity is O(n + m), which is effectively O(n) as `m` (number of unique remainders) is generally much smaller than `n`.
