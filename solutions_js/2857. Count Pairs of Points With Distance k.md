[Leetcode 2857. Count Pairs of Points With Distance k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2857)
## Problem Statement:
Given an array of integer points where `points[i]` represents the coordinate of a point on a 2D plane, and an integer `k`, determine the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that the Euclidean distance between the points is exactly `k`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of the integers in the points array?
2. Can the points have negative coordinates?
3. Are there any constraints on the values for `k`?
4. Should the pairs be unique, i.e., `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` considered the same pair or not?
5. Are there constraints on the size of the input array `points`?

## Code:

Let's start by defining our approach. Since the Euclidean distance (d) between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) on a 2D plane is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \]

Given the problem constraints, this can be written as:
\[ d^2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = k^2 \]

To find the pairs of points that satisfy this condition, let's break down the problem:
1. Iterate over each point and calculate the squared distance to every other point.
2. Check if the squared distance is equal to \( k^2 \).
3. Count pairs where the condition is satisfied.

## Strategy:
1. Calculate \( k^2 \) once since comparison involves squares.
2. Use nested loops to iterate over each pair of points.
3. For each pair, calculate the squared distance and compare it with \( k^2 \).
4. Count and return the number of valid pairs.

## Code Implementation:
```javascript
function countPairs(points, k) {
    let count = 0;
    const kSquared = k * k;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            const dx = points[j][0] - points[i][0];
            const dy = points[j][1] - points[i][1];
            const distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;

            if (distanceSquared === kSquared) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example Usage:
// const points = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1, 0], [2, 1], [4, 4]];
// const k = 2;
// console.log(countPairs(points, k)); // Output will depend on the points array and k
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(n^2) \), where \( n \) is the number of points. This is due to the nested loops that iterate through each pair of points exactly once.
- The first loop runs \( n \) times.
- For each iteration of the first loop, the second loop runs \( n - 1 \), then \( n - 2 \), ..., down to 1 resulting in an average case of \( n/2 \), hence giving \( O(n^2) \) overall complexity.

## Conclusion:
The above code provides a solution to find the number of pairs of points with an exact Euclidean distance of \( k \). The nested loops ensure all pairs are checked, and the comparison of squared distances avoids the complexity of square root calculations, making it computationally efficient in terms of floating-point operations.
