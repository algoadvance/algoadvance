[Leetcode 2102. Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2102)
## Problem Statement
You are given a "Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker" (SORT). Implement the SORT class that has the ability to keep track of the elements added and return them in decreasing order of rank. SORT has the following methods:

1. **add(element)**: Adds an element to the tracker.
2. **get()**: Retrieves the element with the highest rank (i.e., the element that appears the most frequently). If there is a tie, return the one which was added first among the tied values.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the element type restricted to integers or can it be any type (e.g., strings, floats)?**
   - Typically, elements would be integers, but the logic can be extended to other comparable types.

2. **How many elements can we expect to be added to the SORT?**
   - Understanding the scale helps in assessing the performance constraints, but we'll assume a reasonably large number.

3. **Is there a restriction on the frequency of calls to `add` or `get`?**
   - This will guide whether optimizations need to prioritize the add or get operations.

4. **What should be done if `get` is called when no elements have been added?**
   - Returning `null` or throwing an error could be appropriate.

## Strategy
To efficiently implement the SORT class, we need to handle additions and retrievals with attention to both frequency and order of addition. We'll use the following strategy:

1. **Maintain Frequencies**: Use a hash map (dictionary) to count the occurrences of each element.
2. **Track Order**: Use a doubly-linked list to maintain the order of additions.
3. **Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (or priority queue) to efficiently retrieve the element with the highest frequency.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Create a frequency map and a doubly-linked list.
2. **Add Method**:
    - Update the frequency map.
    - Add to the doubly-linked list.
    - Maintain a max-heap to ensure the most frequent element is at the top.
3. **Get Method**:
    - Return the element at the top of the max-heap.

## Code Implementation

Here's the JavaScript code for the SORT class:

```javascript
class SORT {
    constructor() {
        this.freqMap = new Map(); // To keep track of element frequencies.
        this.dll = new DLL(); // To keep track of the order of elements.
        this.maxHeap = new MaxHeap(); // To get the most frequent element.
    }

    add(element) {
        // Update frequency
        if (!this.freqMap.has(element)) {
            this.freqMap.set(element, 0);
        }
        this.freqMap.set(element, this.freqMap.get(element) + 1);
        
        // Update doubly-linked list
        const node = this.dll.append(element);
        
        // Update max-heap
        this.maxHeap.insert(element, this.freqMap.get(element), node);
    }

    get() {
        if (this.maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }
        return this.maxHeap.extractMax().element;
    }
}

class DLL {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
    }

    append(element) {
        const node = new ListNode(element);
        if (this.tail) {
            this.tail.next = node;
            node.prev = this.tail;
        } else {
            this.head = node;
        }
        this.tail = node;
        return node;
    }
}

class ListNode {
    constructor(element) {
        this.element = element;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }
}

class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    insert(element, frequency, node) {
        const heapElement = { element, frequency, node };
        this.heap.push(heapElement);
        this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }

    extractMax() {
        if (this.heap.length === 0) {
            return null;
        }
        const max = this.heap[0];
        const end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this.sinkDown(0);
        }
        return max;
    }

    bubbleUp(index) {
        const element = this.heap[index];
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            const parent = this.heap[parentIndex];
            if (element.frequency <= parent.frequency) break;
            this.heap[index] = parent;
            index = parentIndex;
        }
        this.heap[index] = element;
    }

    sinkDown(index) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[index];

        while (true) {
            let leftChildIdx = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIdx = 2 * index + 2;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                const leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIdx];
                if (leftChild.frequency > element.frequency) {
                    swap = leftChildIdx;
                }
            }

            if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                const rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIdx];
                if (
                    (!swap && rightChild.frequency > element.frequency) ||
                    (swap && rightChild.frequency > this.heap[swap].frequency)
                ) {
                    swap = rightChildIdx;
                }
            }

            if (!swap) break;
            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            index = swap;
        }
        this.heap[index] = element;
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.heap.length === 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **add(element)**:
    - HashMap update: O(1)
    - Doubly-linked list append: O(1)
    - Max-heap insert: O(log n)
    - **Overall**: O(log n)

- **get()**:
    - Max-heap extract: O(log n)
    - **Overall**: O(log n)

This implementation ensures that both additions and retrievals are efficient, taking logarithmic time with respect to the number of elements tracked.
