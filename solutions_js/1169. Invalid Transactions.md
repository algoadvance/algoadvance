[Leetcode 1169. Invalid Transactions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1169)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are invalid.

You have to return all the invalid transactions in any order. To determine if a transaction is invalid, use the following rules:  
- A transaction is invalid if the amount exceeds $1000.
- A transaction is invalid if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.

Each transaction string `transactions[i]` is formatted as `"name,time,amount,city"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple transactions with the same name, time, and city?
2. Are the transactions sorted by time?
3. Should the order of transactions in the output matter?

For now, I'll assume that:
1. Yes, transactions can have the same name, time, and city.
2. No, transactions may not be sorted by time.
3. No, the order of invalid transactions in the output does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Transactions**:
   - First, each transaction string is split into the name, time, amount, and city.
   
2. **Check Invalid Transactions**:
   - Initialize an empty set to store invalid transactions.
   - Iterate through each transaction:
     - Check if the amount exceeds $1000. If so, mark this transaction as invalid.
     - Compare each transaction with every other transaction to check for the same name but different cities within 60 minutes.
   
3. **Output Invalid Transactions**:
   - Collect all invalid transactions and return them as a list.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} transactions
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var invalidTransactions = function(transactions) {
    const invalidSet = new Set();
    const transactionsData = transactions.map(transaction => {
        const [name, time, amount, city] = transaction.split(',');
        return { name, time: parseInt(time), amount: parseInt(amount), city, original: transaction };
    });

    for (let i = 0; i < transactionsData.length; i++) {
        const transactionA = transactionsData[i];
        
        // Check if the amount exceeds $1000
        if (transactionA.amount > 1000) {
            invalidSet.add(transactionA.original);
        }

        // Compare with other transactions
        for (let j = 0; j < transactionsData.length; j++) {
            if (i === j) continue;
            
            const transactionB = transactionsData[j];

            // Same name, different city, and within 60 minutes
            if (transactionA.name === transactionB.name && transactionA.city !== transactionB.city 
                && Math.abs(transactionA.time - transactionB.time) <= 60) {
                invalidSet.add(transactionA.original);
                invalidSet.add(transactionB.original);
            }
        }
    }

    return Array.from(invalidSet);
};

// Example Usage:
const transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing","alice,51,100,mtv"];
console.log(invalidTransactions(transactions));
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing Transactions**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of transactions.
- **Checking Transactions**: `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops comparing each transaction with every other transaction.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of transactions.

Given the potential for double loops, there's an `O(n^2)` relation which may be acceptable if `n` is not exceedingly large.
