[Leetcode 2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2193)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of moves needed to make `s` a palindrome. In one move, you can:

- Swap any two characters of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on string length?**
   - The length of the string `s` is between 1 and 2000.
2. **Character set?**
   - The string `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
3. **Any examples?**
   - Yes, for example:
     - `s = "aabb"` -> 2 moves (swap the 1st 'b' with the 2nd 'a' and the 2nd 'a' with the 2nd 'b')
     - `s = "letelt"` -> 1 move (swap the 1st 't' with the 2nd 'l')

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique where:
1. We keep pointers at the start (`left`) and end (`right`) of the string.
2. We attempt to match characters from the ends towards the center.
3. If characters at `left` and `right` don't match, we look for the nearest matching character to swap with as few operations as possible.
4. We continue this process, moving towards the center of the string.

### Code

```javascript
function minMovesToMakePalindrome(s) {
    let sArray = s.split('');
    let moves = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = sArray.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        if (sArray[left] === sArray[right]) {
            left++;
            right--;
        } else {
            let l = left;
            let r = right;
            while (l < r && sArray[l] !== sArray[right]) l++;
            while (r > l && sArray[r] !== sArray[left]) r--;

            if (l === right) { // No matching character found for right side, do a swap towards center
                [sArray[left], sArray[left + 1]] = [sArray[left + 1], sArray[left]];
                moves++;
            } else if (r === left) { // No matching character found for left side, do a swap towards center
                [sArray[right], sArray[right - 1]] = [sArray[right - 1], sArray[right]];
                moves++;
            } else if (l - left <= right - r) { // Choose the lesser moves swap
                while (l > left) {
                    [sArray[l], sArray[l - 1]] = [sArray[l - 1], sArray[l]];
                    l--;
                    moves++;
                }
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                while (r < right) {
                    [sArray[r], sArray[r + 1]] = [sArray[r + 1], sArray[r]];
                    r++;
                    moves++;
                }
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return moves;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because in each iteration, shifting characters towards the center can take up to O(n) moves, and we may need to do this up to O(n) times.
- However, in average and practical use cases, it should perform better as most characters may be near their correct position.

### Explanation
The implementation uses a two-pointer approach, and it handles mismatched characters by swapping them towards the center incrementally, counting the number of swaps required. This ensures that the process of making the string a palindrome is achieved with minimal moves.
