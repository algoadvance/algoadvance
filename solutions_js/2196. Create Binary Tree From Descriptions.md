[Leetcode 2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2196)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2196: Create Binary Tree From Descriptions

You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where `descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti]` indicates that `parenti` is the parent of `childi` in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore:
- If `isLefti == 1`, then `childi` is the left child of `parenti`.
- If `isLefti == 0`, then `childi` is the right child of `parenti`.

Construct the binary tree described by `descriptions` and return its root node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** Are there any constraints on the size of the input array (`descriptions`)? 
   - We'll assume typical competitive programming constraints unless specified.
2. **Uniqueness:** Are all node values unique?
   - Yes, all node values are unique as indicated in the problem.
3. **Tree Validity:** Is it guaranteed that the descriptions will form a valid binary tree (i.e., no cycles or multiple parents)?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Parse the `descriptions` array to create nodes and build the tree structure.
2. Keep track of all potential nodes using a hash map.
3. Identify the root node by ensuring it is never a child in descriptions.

**Steps:**
1. Use a hash map to store nodes by their values. If a node is referenced, it should be created if it doesn't exist.
2. Another set will be used to keep track of all children nodes.
3. For each description:
   - Create or get the parent node.
   - Create or get the child node.
   - Assign the child node as either the left or right child of the parent node based on `isLeft`.
4. Finally, derive the root by finding the node that is not in the set of child nodes.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}

var createBinaryTree = function(descriptions) {
    const nodes = new Map(); // Stores the TreeNode instances by value
    const children = new Set(); // Keeps track of child nodes
    
    // Helper function to get or create a node
    const getNode = (val) => {
        if (!nodes.has(val)) {
            nodes.set(val, new TreeNode(val));
        }
        return nodes.get(val);
    };
    
    // Build the nodes and tree structure
    for (const [parent, child, isLeft] of descriptions) {
        const parentNode = getNode(parent);
        const childNode = getNode(child);
        
        if (isLeft === 1) {
            parentNode.left = childNode;
        } else {
            parentNode.right = childNode;
        }
        
        children.add(child);
    }
    
    // Find the root (a node that is not a child of any other node)
    let root = null;
    for (const [parent, ,] of descriptions) {
        if (!children.has(parent)) {
            root = getNode(parent);
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return root;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of descriptions. Each node insertion and retrieval operation is `O(1)` due to the use of a hash map and set.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`, for storing the nodes and children set.

This solution efficiently builds the tree and ensures the root is correctly identified.
