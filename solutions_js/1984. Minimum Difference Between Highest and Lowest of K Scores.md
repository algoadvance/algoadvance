[Leetcode 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1984)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `scores` representing the scores of students in a class. Additionally, you are provided with an integer `k`, which represents the number of scores you must select. Your task is to determine the minimum difference between the highest and lowest of the `k` selected scores.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of the `scores` array that we can expect?
2. **Values of Scores**: What is the range of values that each element in `scores` can take?
3. **Value of k**: Will the value of `k` always be less than or equal to the length of the `scores` array?
4. **Sorting Allowed**: Can we sort the array `scores` to help simplify our calculations?

### Strategy

To find the minimum difference between the highest and lowest of `k` scores, a straightforward approach is as follows:

1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array, the difference between any two elements in a subarray of size `k` will be minimized.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse the sorted array and calculate the difference between the first and last elements of each window.
3. **Minimum Difference**: Track the minimum difference encountered during this traversal.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum range difference in a sorted context.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `scores` array.
2. **Sliding Window Traversal**: \(O(n)\), since we only traverse the array once.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} scores
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumDifference = function(scores, k) {
    if (k === 1) return 0;

    // Sort the scores array
    scores.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    
    // Sliding window approach
    for (let i = 0; i <= scores.length - k; i++) {
        const currentDiff = scores[i + k - 1] - scores[i];
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, currentDiff);
    }
    
    return minDiff;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Edge Case:** If `k` is 1, the minimum difference is 0 since we're only picking one score.
2. **Sorting**: The `scores` array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Sliding Window**: Iterate over the sorted array from the start to `scores.length - k`, computing the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the current window of size `k`.
4. **Minimum Difference**: Track the smallest difference observed during the iteration.

This solution is efficient and leverages sorting to simplify the determination of the minimum difference between the highest and lowest scores in a subset of size `k`.
