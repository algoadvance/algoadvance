[Leetcode 2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2651)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `arrival_time` (in hours), and a positive integer `delayed_time` (in hours). Calculate and return the new arrival time in hours. Note that the new arrival time should be in a 24-hour format (0 - 23).

**Example:**
```
Input: arrival_time = 22, delayed_time = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Arrival at 22:00, delayed by 5 hours, will be 27:00, which is 3:00 in 24-hour format.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** What are the constraints on `arrival_time` and `delayed_time`?
    - Both `arrival_time` and `delayed_time` are non-negative integers where `arrival_time` can be between 0 and 23, and `delayed_time` can be any positive integer.

2. **Output Specification:** Should the output always be returned in a 24-hour clock format?
    - Yes, the output should be in the 24-hour format (0 - 23).

3. **Edge Cases:** What should be considered as valid edge cases?
    - `arrival_time` at the beginning (`arrival_time = 0`)
    - `delayed_time` which is a large number, greater than 24.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the strategy is simple:

1. Sum up the `arrival_time` and the `delayed_time`.
2. Since the result could exceed the 24-hour limit, take modulo 24 of the sum.
3. Return the result which would be the new arrival time in 24-hour format.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function calculateDelayedTime(arrival_time, delayed_time) {
    // Calculate total time
    const totalTime = arrival_time + delayed_time;
    
    // Time in 24-hour format
    const resultTime = totalTime % 24;
    
    return resultTime;
}

// Examples
console.log(calculateDelayedTime(22, 5)); // Output: 3
console.log(calculateDelayedTime(0, 24)); // Output: 0 (Exactly 24 hours later is the same time)
console.log(calculateDelayedTime(18, 30)); // Output: 0 (Because 48 hours later is again 0)
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` since it involves only basic arithmetic operations and a modulo operation, all of which require constant time. The space complexity is also `O(1)` since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.
