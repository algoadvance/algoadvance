[Leetcode 2859. Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2859)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the sum of values at the indices of `nums` that have exactly `k` set bits in their binary representation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Clarifications**:
   - **nums**: An array of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - **k**: An integer indicating the required number of set bits in the index, e.g., `k = 2`.

2. **Output**:
   - An integer which is the sum of the values of `nums` at indices that have exactly `k` set bits in their binary representation.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Are there potential constraints on the size of the array `nums` or the range of integer values in `nums`?
   - Should we consider any specific edge cases, such as when `k` is larger than the number of bits used to represent the indices?

### Code
Now I'll provide a JavaScript function to solve the problem.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
function sumIndicesWithKSetBits(nums, k) {
    const countSetBits = (num) => {
        let count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            count += num & 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (countSetBits(i) === k) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
    }

    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sumIndicesWithKSetBits([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)); // Output: The sum of elements at indices with exactly 2 set bits.
```

### Strategy
1. **Count Set Bits**:
   - Define a helper function `countSetBits` to count the number of set bits (1-bits) in the binary representation of a given number.

2. **Iterate over Indices**:
   - Iterate over each index `i` in the array `nums`.

3. **Check Set Bits**:
   - Use the helper function to check if the current index `i` has exactly `k` set bits.

4. **Sum the Values**:
   - If the index `i` has exactly `k` set bits, add the corresponding value `nums[i]` to the sum.

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity is `O(n * log m)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums` and `m` is the maximum possible value of the indices (since the number of bits in the index is `O(log n)`). 
- In practice, considering modern hardware and typical constraints, this approach should perform efficiently.
