[Leetcode 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l915)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

- Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
- `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the length of `left` after such a partitioning. Test cases are generated such that the partitioning exists.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - Typically for array problems, the size can be from 1 to \(10^6\).
   
2. **What kinds of elements can `nums` contain?**
   - `nums` will contain integers, which can be negative, zero, or positive.
   
3. **Is there always exactly one valid partition?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that a partition exists for all given test cases.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can perform the following steps:

1. **Initial Partitioning:**
   - Maintain two arrays `max_left` and `min_right`.
   - Traverse `nums` from left to right to fill in `max_left[i]`, which represents the maximum value from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]`.
   - Traverse `nums` from right to left to fill in `min_right[i]`, which represents the minimum value from `nums[i]` to the end of the array.
   
2. **Finding the Partition Point:**
   - Traverse through the `nums` array to find the smallest index `i` where `max_left[i] <= min_right[i+1]`. The desired length of the `left` subarray will be `i + 1`.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript solution implementing the above approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var partitionDisjoint = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    
    // Initialize max_left and min_right arrays
    let maxLeft = new Array(n).fill(0);
    let minRight = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Fill max_left array
    maxLeft[0] = nums[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxLeft[i] = Math.max(maxLeft[i - 1], nums[i]);
    }
    
    // Fill min_right array
    minRight[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        minRight[i] = Math.min(minRight[i + 1], nums[i]);
    }
    
    // Find the partition point
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (maxLeft[i] <= minRight[i + 1]) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Control should never reach here as per problem constraints
    return -1;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse through the array twice to fill `maxLeft` and `minRight` arrays, and once more to find the partition point.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - Additional space is used for the `maxLeft` and `minRight` arrays.

This approach ensures an efficient solution both in terms of time and space, meeting the constraints and requirements of the problem.
