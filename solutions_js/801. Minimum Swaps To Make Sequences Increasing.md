[Leetcode 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l801)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length. In one operation, you are allowed to swap `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]`.

- For example, if `nums1 = [1,2,3,8]`, and `nums2 = [5,6,7,4]`, you can swap `nums1[3]` with `nums2[3]`, so both `nums1` and `nums2` become `[1,2,3,4]` and `[5,6,7,8]`.

Return the minimum number of swaps required to make both sequences strictly increasing. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the arrays contain negative integers or zeros?
2. Do we need to handle cases where the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` are different?

### Example:
```javascript
Input: nums1 = [1,3,5,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap nums1[3] and nums2[3]. 
Resulting sequences: nums1 = [1,3,5,7], nums2 = [1,2,3,4], which are both strictly increasing.
```

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to optimize the solution. We need to track two states:
1. `keep[i]` - Minimum swaps needed to make both arrays strictly increasing up to index `i` without swapping `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`.
2. `swap[i]` - Minimum swaps needed to make both arrays strictly increasing up to index `i` with swapping `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `keep[0] = 0` and `swap[0] = 1` since the first pair is not swapped initially, and if swapped, it takes one swap.
2. Iterate through the arrays from index `1` to `n - 1`. For each `i`:
   * If both `nums1[i] > nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]`:
      - `keep[i] = keep[i-1]`
      - `swap[i] = swap[i-1] + 1`
   * If both `nums1[i] > nums2[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]`:
      - `keep[i] = min(keep[i], swap[i-1])`
      - `swap[i] = min(swap[i], keep[i-1] + 1)`
3. The solution is the minimum value between `keep[n-1]` and `swap[n-1]`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is \(O(n)\) since we are iterating through the array once.

## Code

```javascript
function minSwap(nums1, nums2) {
  const n = nums1.length;
  let keep = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
  let swap = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
  
  keep[0] = 0;
  swap[0] = 1;

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (nums1[i] > nums1[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums2[i - 1]) {
      keep[i] = keep[i - 1];
      swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1;
    }
    if (nums1[i] > nums2[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums1[i - 1]) {
      keep[i] = Math.min(keep[i], swap[i - 1]);
      swap[i] = Math.min(swap[i], keep[i - 1] + 1);
    }
  }
  
  return Math.min(keep[n - 1], swap[n - 1]);
}

// Example usage:
const nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 4];
const nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 7];
console.log(minSwap(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 1
```

This algorithm ensures that both arrays become strictly increasing with the minimum number of swaps.
