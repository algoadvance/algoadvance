[Leetcode 2086. Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2086)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `hamsters` where:

- `hamsters[i] == 'H'` indicates there is a hamster at the `i-th` position.
- `hamsters[i] == '.'` indicates an empty space at the `i-th` position.

All hamsters must be fed water using food buckets. However, the hamster can only be fed from a food bucket if a food bucket is placed at either of the i-th, (i-1)-th, or (i+1)-th positions.

Return the minimum number of food buckets needed to feed all hamsters. If it's not possible to feed all hamsters, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is the length of the `hamsters` string limited?
    - Is it guaranteed that the string will only contain characters 'H' and '.'?

2. **Output:**
    - If not all hamsters can be fed, should I only return -1 or any specific message?

3. **Special Cases:**
    - Are there any edge cases such as an empty string?

Assume the answers:
1. The length is reasonable such that an O(n) solution is acceptable.
2. Yes, the string only contains 'H' and '.'.
3. Only return -1 if not possible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the strategy revolves around greedy placement of food buckets:
1. Traverse the hamsters string.
2. For each hamster ('H'):
   - Check if there is an existing bucket that can already feed this hamster.
   - If not, place a new bucket optimally either on `(i-1)` or `(i+1)`.
3. Check edge cases, such as isolated hamsters without adjacent empty spots.

### Code

```javascript
function minBuckets(hamsters) {
    let buckets = new Set();
    const n = hamsters.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (hamsters[i] === 'H') {
            // Check if this hamster can be fed by an existing bucket
            if ((i > 0 && buckets.has(i - 1)) || (buckets.has(i))) {
                continue;
            }
            // Place the bucket at positions that can potentially feed the most
            if (i + 1 < n && hamsters[i + 1] === '.') {
                buckets.add(i + 1);
            } else if (i > 0 && hamsters[i - 1] === '.') {
                buckets.add(i - 1);
            } else {
                return -1; // No place to put a bucket for this hamster
            }
        }
    }

    return buckets.size;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minBuckets("H..H")); // Output: 2
console.log(minBuckets(".H.H.")); // Output: 1
console.log(minBuckets("H.HH..H")); // Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the hamsters string. This is because we effectively traverse the string a constant number of times and use a set for constant time insertions and membership checks.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case due to the additional set to track positions of food buckets.
