[Leetcode 678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l678)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'(', ')'` and `'*'`, write a function to check whether this string is valid. The rules are as follows:

1. Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
2. Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
3. Left parenthesis `'('`, right parenthesis `')'`, and the asterisk `'*'` can also represent an empty string.
4. An asterisk `'*'` can represent a single right parenthesis `')'`, a single left parenthesis `'('`, or an empty string.

An empty string is also considered valid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, an empty string is considered valid.
2. Should the function consider invalid characters beyond '(', ')', and '*'?
   - No, we can assume the input contains only these characters.
3. What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - It is not specified, but we should handle reasonably large inputs efficiently.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach to traverse the string:

1. Maintain two counters:
    - `low`: the lowest possible number of open parentheses that need to be matched.
    - `high`: the highest possible number of open parentheses that need to be matched.
    
2. Traverse the string character by character:
    - If the character is `'('`, increment both `low` and `high`.
    - If the character is `')'`, decrement both `low` and `high`.
    - If the character is `'*'`, increment `high` to consider it as `(`, and decrement `low` to consider it as `)`.
    
3. During the traversal, ensure that `high` never goes negative (indicating more `)` than `(` or `*` adjusted accordingly). If `high` goes negative, the string is invalid.
4. At the end of traversal, ensure that `low` is 0 (indicating all `(` are matched properly).

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function implementing this strategy:

```javascript
function checkValidString(s) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = 0;

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '(') {
            low++;
            high++;
        } else if (char === ')') {
            low = Math.max(low - 1, 0);
            high--;
        } else if (char === '*') {
            low = Math.max(low - 1, 0);
            high++;
        }

        if (high < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return low === 0;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkValidString("(*)")); // Outputs: true
console.log(checkValidString("(*))")); // Outputs: true
console.log(checkValidString("()")); // Outputs: true
console.log(checkValidString(")(")); // Outputs: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the `low` and `high` counters.
