[Leetcode 1864. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1864)
### Problem Statement:

Given a binary string `s`, you need to rearrange the characters of the string to make it an alternating binary string. A binary string is considered alternating if no two adjacent characters are the same. Return the minimum number of swaps needed to make the string alternating, or -1 if it is impossible.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the definition of a swap?**
   - A swap involves choosing any two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in the string and exchanging the characters `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

2. **Is the input guaranteed to be a valid binary string consisting only of `0`s and `1`s?**
   - Yes, the input is guaranteed to be a binary string.

3. **What should be returned if it is impossible to make the string alternating?**
   - Return `-1`.

4. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The length of the string can go up to \(10^5\).

Given the problem and clarifications, letâ€™s proceed to the strategy and code.

### Strategy:

1. **Counting:** 
   - Count the number of `1`s and `0`s.

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - An alternating binary string must have the absolute difference between the number of `1`s and `0`s not more than 1.
   - Therefore, if the absolute difference between count of `1`s and count of `0`s is more than 1, then return `-1`.

3. **Possible Patterns:**
   - Pattern A: Starting with `0`, the string should look like `010101...`
   - Pattern B: Starting with `1`, the string should look like `101010...`

4. **Counting Swaps for Each Pattern:**
   - For both patterns, calculate the number of misplaced `0`s and `1`s.
   - The number of swaps needed for each pattern is the maximum number of misplaced `0`s or `1`s.

5. **Result:**
   - If both patterns are valid (taking into account the difference in counts), return the minimum swaps needed from the two patterns.

### Code:

```javascript
function minSwaps(s) {
    let count0 = 0, count1 = 0;
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '0') count0++;
        else count1++;
    }

    if (Math.abs(count0 - count1) > 1) return -1;

    let swapsPatternA = 0, swapsPatternB = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            // Even index
            if (s[i] !== '0') swapsPatternA++; // Should be '0' for pattern A
            if (s[i] !== '1') swapsPatternB++; // Should be '1' for pattern B
        } else {
            // Odd index
            if (s[i] !== '1') swapsPatternA++; // Should be '1' for pattern A
            if (s[i] !== '0') swapsPatternB++; // Should be '0' for pattern B
        }
    }

    if (count0 > count1) {
        return swapsPatternA / 2;
    } else if (count1 > count0) {
        return swapsPatternB / 2;
    } else {
        return Math.min(swapsPatternA / 2, swapsPatternB / 2);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Counting the `0`s and `1`s in the string takes \(O(n)\).
- Calculating mismatches for both patterns takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the binary string `s`. This solution is optimal given the constraints.
