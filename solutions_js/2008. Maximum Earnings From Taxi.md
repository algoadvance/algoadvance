[Leetcode 2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2008)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `rides` and `n`:

- `rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi]` indicates that the `i-th` passenger has a ride from point `starti` to point `endi` and will offer a tip of `tipi`.
- You want to maximize your earnings by picking some `rides`.

You can drive at most `n` miles in total. Your earnings for each ride `(start, end, tip)` include both the distance traveled and the tip.

Return the maximum earnings you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the points in the rides guaranteed to be in sorted order by the `start` position?
2. Can you take multiple rides simultaneously or is it one ride at a time?
3. Is `n` the total miles you can drive or the total distance covered in rides?

Assuming `n` is the total miles that can be driven and you can only take one ride at a time:

### Strategy
1. **Sort the rides array** by the `end` position. This helps in making sure that once we decide on a ride, there's a clear picture of what can be chosen next.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum earnings by the time we finish the `i-th` ride.
3. **Binary Search**: To find the last ride that can be completed before starting the current ride efficiently.

### Solution Code
```javascript
function maxTaxiEarnings(n, rides) {
    // Sort rides by their end time
    rides.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    const dp = new Array(rides.length).fill(0);
    dp[0] = rides[0][1] - rides[0][0] + rides[0][2];
    let maxEarnings = dp[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < rides.length; i++) {
        const [start, end, tip] = rides[i];
        const currEarning = end - start + tip;
        
        let lastNonOverlapping = -1;
        let left = 0;
        let right = i - 1;

        // Perform binary search for the last non-overlapping ride
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (rides[mid][1] <= start) {
                lastNonOverlapping = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        if (lastNonOverlapping !== -1) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], currEarning + dp[lastNonOverlapping]);
        } else {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], currEarning);
        }

        maxEarnings = Math.max(maxEarnings, dp[i]);
    }

    return maxEarnings;
}

// Example usage:
const rides = [
    [2, 5, 4],
    [1, 5, 1]
];
const n = 5;
console.log(maxTaxiEarnings(n, rides));  // Output: 7
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting** helps us to consider ending the ride earliest as we may fit more rides if we finish rides sooner.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array `dp`**:
   - `dp[i]` holds the maximum earning we can get till the `i-th` ride.
   - For each ride, we calculate the earning if we were to take that specific ride.
   - Using a binary search, we find the last non-overlapping ride. If such a ride exists, we add its earnings (`dp[lastNonOverlapping]`) to the current ride's earning and update our DP array.
   - If no non-overlapping ride exists, the current earning is considered independently. Update the DP table by taking the maximum of the previous maximum earnings (`dp[i-1]`) and the new earning calculated.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(m log m), where m is the number of rides.
- **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: O(m log m).

Overall Time Complexity: O(m log m).

This approach ensures that we can handle larger inputs efficiently while maximizing the taxi driver's earnings.
