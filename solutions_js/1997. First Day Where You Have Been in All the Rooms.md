[Leetcode 1997. First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1997)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nextVisit` of length `n`, where `nextVisit[i]` represents the next room you should visit after visiting the `i-th` room. The problem is to determine the first day you have visited all the rooms at least once.

Each room can be visited multiple times, and visiting a room from a room might take multiple days (not necessarily contiguous). Room 0 is the starting point, and the time taken to visit the next room is exactly one day.

Write a function `firstDayBeenInAllRooms(nextVisit)` that returns the first day you have been in all rooms.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any cyclic dependency in visiting rooms?**
   - The provided `nextVisit` array can have cyclic dependencies since it tells us exactly which room to visit next from a given room.

2. **Can a room point to itself as the next room to visit?**
   - Yes, a room can point to itself as `nextVisit[i]` can be `i`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values?**
   - The value of `nextVisit[i]` lies within the range `[0, i]` according to the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. We start at room 0 with day 0.
2. Use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the first day we reach room `i` for the first time. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 because we start from room 0.
3. For each room `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
   - Calculate the day we reach room `i` based on the previous rooms and the `nextVisit` array.
   - Use a combination of `dp` and arithmetic calculations to determine the expected day.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nextVisit
 * @return {number}
 */
function firstDayBeenInAllRooms(nextVisit) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    const n = nextVisit.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 + dp[i - 1] - dp[nextVisit[i - 1]]) % MOD;
        if (dp[i] < 0) {
            dp[i] += MOD;
        }
    }

    return dp[n - 1];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(firstDayBeenInAllRooms([0, 0, 2])); // Output expected: 6
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 0` since the first day starts in room 0.
2. **Transition**: For moving from room `i-1` to room `i`:
   - When you first visit room `i`, you go there directly via `dp[i - 1] + 1`.
   - To organize further visits and get to the correct computation, the calculation formula is adjusted to ensure we take care of return cycles using `dp[prev]` and the `MOD` operator to handle large numbers.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modulo `1,000,000,007` to ensure we stay within bounds of integer limits.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**:
- We iterate through each room exactly once and perform constant time operations in each iteration.

This ensures the algorithm is efficient and can handle the upper constraints typical of competitive programming problems.
