[Leetcode 2826. Sorting Three Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2826)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` consisting of a permutation of the integers `[1, 1, ..., 2, 2, ..., 3, 3, ...]`, we want to sort this array in non-decreasing order. The array `nums` may have any of the following distributions:
- All elements are `1`
- All elements are `2`
- All elements are `3`
- Mixture of `1`, `2`, and `3`.

The task is to sort the input array such that all `1`s come before `2`s, which come before `3`s.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input array?**
   - The length of the input array can be as large as 100,000.

2. **Do we have to use any specific algorithm to perform the sort?**
   - No specific sorting algorithm is mandated, but we should consider the most efficient way to sort the array given its constraints.

3. **Can the array contain any integers other than 1, 2, or 3?**
   - No, the array contains only the integers `1`, `2`, and `3`.

### Strategy

Given that the array contains only three unique values (`1`, `2`, and `3`), we can utilize a Counting Sort-like algorithm to sort the array in linear time. This is optimal since it leverages the constraint of having only three possible values.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, traverse the array to count the occurrences of `1`s, `2`s, and `3`s.
2. **Construct Sorted Array**: Utilize the counts to overwrite the input array in-place with the sorted order (i.e., all `1`s followed by all `2`s, followed by all `3`s).

This approach ensures a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (constant additional space excluding input size).

### Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sortThreeGroups(nums) {
    let count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0;

    // Count occurrences of 1s, 2s, and 3s
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 1) {
            count1++;
        } else if (num === 2) {
            count2++;
        } else if (num === 3) {
            count3++;
        }
    }

    // Overwrite nums with sorted order
    let index = 0;
    while (count1 > 0) {
        nums[index++] = 1;
        count1--;
    }
    while (count2 > 0) {
        nums[index++] = 2;
        count2--;
    }
    while (count3 > 0) {
        nums[index++] = 3;
        count3--;
    }
}

// Example usage
let nums = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3];
sortThreeGroups(nums);
console.log(nums); // Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```

This function efficiently sorts the given array `nums` containing only `1`, `2`, and `3` in linear time, leveraging the counting sort methodology.
