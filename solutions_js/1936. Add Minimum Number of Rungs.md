[Leetcode 1936. Add Minimum Number of Rungs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1936)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **strictly increasing** integer array `rungs` that represents the height of rungs on a ladder. You are currently on the ground at height `0`, and you want to reach the last rung.

You are also given an integer `dist`. You can only climb to the next rung if the distance between where you are and the next rung is at most `dist`. You are required to add the minimum number of rungs to the ladder in order for you to be able to climb to the last rung.

Return the minimum number of rungs you need to add to the ladder.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rungs = [1,3,5,10], dist = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
You currently cannot reach the last rung. You can add new rungs at height 7 and 8 to be able to climb to the last rung.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rungs = [3,6,8,10], dist = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You can reach all the rungs without adding additional rungs.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rungs = [3,4,6,7], dist = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You can only add one rung at height 5.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= rungs.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= rungs[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= dist <= 10^9
- `rungs` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

To make sure we understand the problem correctly, let's clarify some points:
- What happens if `dist` is larger than all the gaps between the rungs? In this case, we don't need to add any rungs.
- Are the added rungs always integers? Yes.
- Should we assume the starting height is 0? Yes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the `rungs` array and, for each rung, check if the distance to the next rung exceeds `dist`. If it does, we need to add the minimum number of rungs necessary to bridge that gap. 

Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current height (starting at 0).
2. Initialize a counter for the number of rungs to add.
3. Iterate through each rung in the `rungs` array:
   - Calculate the gap between the current height and the next rung.
   - If the gap is greater than `dist`, calculate how many rungs need to be added.
   - Move to the next rung.
4. Return the counter of added rungs after the loop completes.

### Code

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
function addRungs(rungs, dist) {
    let currentHeight = 0;
    let addedRungs = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < rungs.length; i++) {
        const gap = rungs[i] - currentHeight;
        
        if (gap > dist) {
            addedRungs += Math.floor((gap - 1) / dist);
        }
        
        currentHeight = rungs[i];
    }
    
    return addedRungs;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(addRungs([1,3,5,10], 2));  // Output: 2
console.log(addRungs([3,6,8,10], 3));  // Output: 0
console.log(addRungs([3,4,6,7], 2));   // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `rungs` array. This is because we iterate through the array exactly once. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we only use a constant amount of extra space for our variables.
