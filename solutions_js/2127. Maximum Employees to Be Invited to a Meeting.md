[Leetcode 2127. Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2127)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `favorite`, where `favorite[i]` denotes the favorite employee of the `i-th` employee. Your task is to find the maximum number of employees that can be invited to a round-table meeting such that the group of invited employees must satisfy these constraints:
- An invited employee must directly sit next to their favorite employee in the seating arrangement.

Return the maximum number of employees invited to the meeting.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the input array always have valid indices that represent existing employees?
2. Is it possible that an employee can have themselves as a favorite, forming a loop of one person?
3. Will the input array always contain non-negative integers?

Above questions are to ensure the validity and constraints of the input.

### Strategy
To tackle this problem, think about it in terms of graph theory:
- Each employee points to their favorite forming a directed graph.
- We need to find maximum possible cycles formed in this graph.
- Specifically, the seating arrangement implies that each employee must sit next to their favorite, meaning we are looking for cycles or pairs of nodes (mutual favorites).

Approach:
1. **Cycle Detection:** Identify all simple cycles in the graph. Any cycle found can be a potential valid group for the meeting.
2. **Chain Extension:** For 2-nodes cycles, extend them with chains leading to them if possible.

Steps:
1. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect all cycles in the graph.
2. Track the maximum length of chains extending to a 2-node cycle.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumInvitations(favorite) {
    const n = favorite.length;

    const visited = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const enteringTime = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const exitTime = new Array(n).fill(0);
    let time = 1;
    let maxCycle = 0;
    let maxChains = new Array(n).fill(0);

    function dfs(node) {
        visited[node] = 1;
        enteringTime[node] = time++;
        const next = favorite[node];

        if (!visited[next]) {
            const cycleLength = dfs(next);
            if (cycleLength > 0) {
                return cycleLength + 1;
            }
        } else if (visited[next] === 1) {
            // Cycle Detected
            const cycleLength = enteringTime[node] - enteringTime[next] + 1;
            maxCycle = Math.max(maxCycle, cycleLength);
            return cycleLength;
        }

        visited[node] = 2;
        return 0;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(i);
        }
    }

    function findMaxChainLength(node) {
        let count = 0;
        while (!maxChains[node] && visited[node] !== 2) {
            count++;
            node = favorite[node];
        }
        return maxChains[node] + count;
    }

    // Find and extend chains for 2-node cycles
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (visited[i] === 2 && favorite[favorite[i]] === i) {
            let chain1 = findMaxChainLength(i);
            let chain2 = findMaxChainLength(favorite[i]);
            maxCycle = Math.max(maxCycle, chain1 + chain2);
        }
    }

    return maxCycle;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The code runs in linear time, O(n), where `n` is the number of employees. This efficiency arises because each employee is visited at most twice (once during the cycle detection and once during the chain length calculation).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(n), due to the arrays used to track visited nodes, entry times, and chain lengths.
