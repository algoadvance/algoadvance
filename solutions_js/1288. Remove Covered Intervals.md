[Leetcode 1288. Remove Covered Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1288)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, an interval `[a, b)` is said to be covered by an interval `[c, d)` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`. 

You need to remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

Return the number of remaining intervals.

### Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], and [1,4] is also covered by [2,8].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the intervals be provided in any order?**
   - Yes, intervals can be given in any order.
  
2. **Is it possible to have overlapping intervals that are not covered?**
   - Yes, overlapping is possible without one being fully covered by the other.
  
3. **What is the range of interval values?**
   - Intervals are given as integer values.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the intervals**: First, we will sort the intervals. The sorting will be based on the start value in ascending order. If two intervals have the same start value, we'll sort them by end value in descending order. This approach ensures that any interval that could potentially cover another interval will come first in the sorted order.
  
2. **Track the maximum endpoint**: We will iterate through the sorted intervals and keep track of the maximum endpoint seen so far in the variable `maxEnd`.

3. **Count uncovered intervals**: For each interval, if its end value exceeds `maxEnd`, it means this interval is not covered by any of the previously seen intervals. We will update `maxEnd` and increment the count of uncovered intervals.

4. **Return the count**: After processing all the intervals, the count of uncovered intervals will be our result.

## Code
Here's the full implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeCoveredIntervals = function(intervals) {
    // Sort intervals by start time ascending, and by end time descending if start time is the same
    intervals.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] === b[0]) {
            return b[1] - a[1];
        }
        return a[0] - b[0];
    });

    let maxEnd = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let interval of intervals) {
        let [start, end] = interval;
        if (end > maxEnd) {
            count++;
            maxEnd = end;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example usage
console.log(removeCoveredIntervals([[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]])); // Output: 2
console.log(removeCoveredIntervals([[1,4],[2,3]])); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the intervals**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of intervals.
- **Iterating through the intervals**: O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a few extra variables.
