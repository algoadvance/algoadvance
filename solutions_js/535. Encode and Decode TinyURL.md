[Leetcode 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l535)
### Problem Statement
The problem involves designing a TinyURL service to encode and decode URLs. This entails creating a method to convert long URLs into shorter versions and another to convert them back to their original form.

1. **encode(longUrl: string): string**: Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
2. **decode(shortUrl: string): string**: Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.

The encoded URL should be unique, and there's no restriction on the length of the short URL as long as it helps reduce the size considerably.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length of the URL**: Is there a maximum or minimum length for the input and shortened URLs?
2. **Accessibility**: Should the encoded URL be globally unique for all instances, or is it sufficient for each instance of the running service only?
3. **Collisions**: How do we handle URL collisions, if at all?
4. **Character Set**: Are there any limitations on the characters used in the shortened URLs?

For simplicity, we will assume that:
- The encoded URLs need to be unique within the same instance of the application.
- We can use any character set for the shortened URL.
- Collisions need to be avoided.

### Strategy
To tackle this problem, we will employ the following strategy:
1. **Hashing Function**: Use a hashing function to generate a unique short code for each long URL.
2. **Mapping Storage**: Use a data structure like a Map (or Object) to store the mapping between the long URLs and their shortened versions, both ways (i.e., long to short and short to long).

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
class TinyURL {
    constructor() {
        this.urlMap = new Map();
        this.codeMap = new Map();
        this.characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';
        this.baseUrl = "http://tinyurl.com/";
    }

    // Helper to generate a random 6-character string for our short URL
    generateCode() {
        let code = '';
        for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
            code += this.characters[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.characters.length)];
        }
        return code;
    }

    encode(longUrl) {
        if (this.urlMap.has(longUrl)) {
            return this.baseUrl + this.urlMap.get(longUrl);
        }

        let code;
        do {
            code = this.generateCode();
        } while (this.codeMap.has(code));

        this.urlMap.set(longUrl, code);
        this.codeMap.set(code, longUrl);

        return this.baseUrl + code;
    }

    decode(shortUrl) {
        const code = shortUrl.replace(this.baseUrl, '');
        return this.codeMap.get(code) || null;
    }
}

// Usage example:
// const tinyURL = new TinyURL();
// const shortUrl = tinyURL.encode("https://www.example.com");
// console.log(shortUrl); // short URL
// const longUrl = tinyURL.decode(shortUrl);
// console.log(longUrl); // should print "https://www.example.com"
```

### Time Complexity
- **encode(longUrl)**: O(1) on average because it's a simple hashmap operation, though in the worst case, generating a unique code might take multiple attempts.
- **decode(shortUrl)**: O(1) because it directly accesses the hashmap to fetch the original URL.

### Explanation
1. **generateCode**: Creates a random 6-character code to be used as the unique identifier for the shortened URL.
2. **encode**: Checks if the URL is already encoded. If not, it generates a new unique code and stores the mappings in both directions.
3. **decode**: Strips the base URL to get the code and retrieves the original URL from the mapping.

By storing mappings in both directions, we ensure that our encode and decode operations are efficient.
