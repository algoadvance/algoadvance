[Leetcode 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2367)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

1. `i < j < k`
2. `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`
3. `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`

Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same elements be used in different triplets?**
   - Yes, as long as the index conditions `i < j < k` and the difference condition are satisfied.
   
2. **What is the maximum size for `nums`?**
   - This isn't specified, but typically for problems like this, arrays can be quite large (up to 10^4 elements).

3. **Are there any constraints on the values inside the nums array?**
   - Yes, it is strictly increasing, which simplifies our task of ensuring `i < j < k`.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Check every possible triplet `(i, j, k)` and verify if they satisfy the given conditions. This approach would be simplistic but likely inefficient.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use a set to keep track of the elements already seen.
   - Iterate through each element in `nums` and check if `nums[j] - diff` and `nums[j] + diff` are in the set.
   - If they are, then the required conditions are met for an arithmetic triplet.

The second approach is more efficient in terms of time complexity because checking existence in a set is on average O(1).

### Code

```javascript
function arithmeticTriplets(nums, diff) {
    let count = 0;
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const num = nums[i];
        if (numSet.has(num - diff) && numSet.has(num + diff)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(arithmeticTriplets([4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 1)); // Output: 3
console.log(arithmeticTriplets([1, 3, 5, 7], 2)); // Output: 2
console.log(arithmeticTriplets([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is efficient because each lookup in the set `numSet` is average O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the space used by the set which stores up to `n` elements.

This provides a balanced solution with respect to both time and space complexity.
