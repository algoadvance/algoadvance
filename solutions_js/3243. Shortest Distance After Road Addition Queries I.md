[Leetcode 3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3243)
### Problem Statement

You are given a data structure representing a weighted undirected graph with \( n \) nodes and \( m \) edges. The nodes are numbered from 0 to \( n-1 \), and each edge is defined by a triplet (u, v, w) where \( u \) and \( v \) are the end nodes and \( w \) is the weight (distance) of the edge. 

You will be provided multiple queries. Each query has two forms:

1. **Addition Query**: Add a new edge (u, v, w) to the graph.
2. **Distance Query**: Find the shortest distance (shortest path) between two nodes (a, b).

You need to process these queries efficiently. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How should the input and output be structured?**
   - Input includes the initial graph configuration and a list of queries.
   - Output for each distance query should be the shortest distance between the given nodes after processing the queries so far.

2. **Can the graph have multiple edges between any two pairs of nodes?**
   - The problem allows for multiple queries, so we need to handle dynamic changes, which may include multiple edges between the same nodes.

3. **What should be returned if there is no path between two nodes in a distance query?**
   - If there is no path, we can return `-1` or `Infinity` based on the requirement. Let's assume we return `Infinity` for such cases.

### Strategy

To handle the dynamic nature of the graph and efficiently answer shortest path queries, we'll use the following approach:

1. **Graph Representation**: We'll use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Dynamic Path Updates**: For handling shortest paths dynamically, we'll use **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** which is suitable for dense graphs and allows for easy updates and recalculations of all-pairs shortest paths when a new edge is added.

### Code

Here is a JavaScript implementation that processes the described queries:

```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor(n) {
        this.n = n;
        // Initialize the adjacency matrix for distance with Infinity
        this.dist = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
        // Distance from a node to itself is 0
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            this.dist[i][i] = 0;
        }
    }
    
    // Add an edge to the graph
    addEdge(u, v, w) {
        this.dist[u][v] = Math.min(this.dist[u][v], w);
        this.dist[v][u] = Math.min(this.dist[v][u], w);
        this.floydWarshall(); // Recompute all-pairs shortest paths
    }
    
    // Run Floyd-Warshall algorithm to update distances
    floydWarshall() {
        const n = this.n;
        for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (this.dist[i][j] > this.dist[i][k] + this.dist[k][j]) {
                        this.dist[i][j] = this.dist[i][k] + this.dist[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Query the shortest path between two nodes a and b
    shortestDistance(a, b) {
        return this.dist[a][b] === Infinity ? -1 : this.dist[a][b];
    }
}

// Processing function to handle queries
function processQueries(n, edges, queries) {
    const graph = new Graph(n);
    
    // Initialize the graph with given edges
    for (const [u, v, w] of edges) {
        graph.addEdge(u, v, w);
    }
    
    // Process each query and store results
    const results = [];
    for (const query of queries) {
        if (query[0] === 'ADD') {
            const [_, u, v, w] = query;
            graph.addEdge(u, v, w);
        } else if (query[0] === 'DIST') {
            const [_, a, b] = query;
            results.push(graph.shortestDistance(a, b));
        }
    }
    
    return results;
}

// Example usage
const n = 4;
const edges = [
    [0, 1, 4],
    [0, 2, 1],
    [2, 1, 2],
    [1, 3, 1],
];
const queries = [
    ['DIST', 0, 3],
    ['ADD', 3, 2, 5],
    ['DIST', 0, 3],
];

console.log(processQueries(n, edges, queries)); // Output: [3, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization and Edge Addition**: Each edge addition triggers the Floyd-Warshall algorithm which has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\).
2. **Distance Queries**: Each distance query runs in \(O(1)\) time since we lookup the already computed shortest distance.

Since the primary operation is updating the all-pairs shortest paths, the overall complexity for a sequence of \(q\) queries becomes \(O(q \cdot n^3)\). This complexity is suitable for dense graphs and smaller problem sizes but may be infeasible for very large and sparse graphs.
