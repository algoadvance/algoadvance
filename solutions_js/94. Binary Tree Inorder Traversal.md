[Leetcode 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l94)
## Problem Statement

The problem requires performing an in-order traversal of a binary tree. The goal is to return the nodes' values in the order of an in-order traversal.

**In-order traversal sequence**:
1. Traverse the left subtree.
2. Visit the root node.
3. Traverse the right subtree.

Given a binary tree, return its in-order traversal as an array.

### Example:
**Input**: [1, null, 2, 3]  
**Output**: [1, 3, 2]  
Explanation: The root node is `1`, it has no left child, its right child is `2`, which in turn has the left child `3`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we assume the input is always a valid binary tree?
   - Yes.
2. Can the tree have duplicate values?
   - Yes, the tree can have duplicate values.
3. Are there any restrictions on tree size?
   - There are no specific restrictions mentioned; we need to handle cases efficiently, even for a large tree.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using both recursive and iterative approaches. Below, I'll provide the recursive solution, which is more intuitive.

### Recursive Approach:
1. Define a helper function to perform the in-order traversal.
2. If the current node is `null`, return.
3. Traverse the left subtree.
4. Visit the current node (add its value to the result array).
5. Traverse the right subtree.

### Iterative Approach (additional option):
1. Use a stack to manage traversal.
2. Initialize the current node to the root.
3. Push nodes to the stack while traversing the left subtree.
4. Pop from the stack, visit the node, and then traverse the right subtree.

Here I will present both approaches: recursive and iterative.

## Code

### Recursive Approach:
```javascript
function inorderTraversal(root) {
    const result = [];
    
    function traverse(node) {
        if (node !== null) {
            traverse(node.left);
            result.push(node.val);
            traverse(node.right);
        }
    }
    
    traverse(root);
    return result;
}
```

### Iterative Approach:
```javascript
function inorderTraversal(root) {
    const result = [];
    const stack = [];
    let current = root;
    
    while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }

        current = stack.pop();
        result.push(current.val);
        current = current.right;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Recursive Approach**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree because each node is visited once.
- **Iterative Approach**: O(n) for the same reason.
Both approaches also have a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case (for a completely unbalanced tree), due to the call stack or the stack data structure.
