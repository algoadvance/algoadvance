[Leetcode 3067. Count Pairs of Connectable Servers in a Weighted Tree Network](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3067)
### Problem Statement

In this problem, you need to find the number of pairs of connectable servers in a weighted tree network. 

The weighted tree is composed of `n` servers, connected by `n-1` edges each having a specific weight. For a pair of servers \( (u, v) \) to be connectable:

1. The weight of the unique path between `u` and `v` should be even.
   
The input consists of

1. An integer `n`, which is the number of servers.
2. An array of `(n-1)` edges, where each edge is represented as a triplet `(u, v, w)`, denoting that there is an edge between server `u` and server `v` with weight `w`.

You need to return the number of such connectable pairs \( (u, v) \).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format:** How is the input presented (e.g., as a JSON, as function arguments)?
2. **Output format:** Should the answer be returned directly as an integer, or formatted in a specific way?

### Strategy

1. **Representation of the tree:** We'll represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Depth-first Search (DFS):** Perform a DFS to determine the parity (even or odd) of the path sum from a fixed root to each node.
3. **Count nodes by parity:** Count the number of nodes that have an even path sum and the number that have an odd path sum.
4. **Calculating pairs:**
   - Pairs of two even-sum nodes
   - Pairs of two odd-sum nodes.
   
   The number of connectable pairs will be the sum of the above two values.

### Code

Letâ€™s implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function countPairsOfConnectableServers(n, edges) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Building the adjacency list
    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => []);

    for (const [u, v, w] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push([v, w]);
        adjList[v].push([u, w]);
    }

    // To store the parity of the path sum from node 1 to each node
    const parity = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    const visited = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);

    // Depth-first search
    function dfs(node, currentParity) {
        visited[node] = true;
        parity[node] = currentParity;

        for (const [neighbor, weight] of adjList[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                dfs(neighbor, currentParity ^ (weight % 2));
            }
        }
    }

    // Starting DFS from node 1, with an initial parity of 0 (even)
    dfs(1, 0);

    // Count nodes by their parity
    let evenCount = 0;
    let oddCount = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (parity[i] === 0) {
            evenCount++;
        } else {
            oddCount++;
        }
    }

    // Number of valid pairs
    return (evenCount * (evenCount - 1)) / 2 + (oddCount * (oddCount - 1)) / 2;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:** \( O(n) \) as we are processing each edge once.
2. **DFS Traversal:** \( O(n) \) as we visit each node and edge exactly once.
3. **Parity Counting:** \( O(n) \) as we iterate through the nodes to count parities.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n) \). The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the storage of the adjacency list, parity array, and visited array.
