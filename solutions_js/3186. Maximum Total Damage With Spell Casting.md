[Leetcode 3186. Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3186)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a function that calculates the maximum total damage achievable using a limited number of spell castings. Each spell has a fixed amount of damage, but you can only cast a limited number of spells. Given a list of spells and their respective damage values, along with the constraints on the number of spells you can cast, determine the maximum total damage possible.

**Instructions:**
- You are given an array of integers `spells` where each integer represents the damage of a spell.
- You are also given an integer `totalSpells` which represents the maximum number of spells you can cast.

Write a function `maxTotalDamage(spells, totalSpells)` that returns the maximum total damage you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the spell list contain negative values? 
   - Assume all values are non-negative.

2. What should be the output if the `totalSpells` is 0 or if the `spells` array is empty?
   - The output should be `0` in both cases.

3. Can the `totalSpells` be more than the length of the `spells` array?
   - If `totalSpells` is greater than the length of the `spells` array, the maximum total damage would be the sum of all spells in the array.

4. Are all the numbers in `spells` non-negative integers?
   - Yes, you can assume all integers in `spells` are non-negative.

### Strategy

To maximize the total damage with a given number of spell castings:

1. **Sort the spells array** in descending order.
2. **Select the top** `totalSpells` values from the sorted array.
3. **Sum** these top values to get the maximum total damage.

### Code

```javascript
function maxTotalDamage(spells, totalSpells) {
    if (totalSpells === 0 || spells.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Sort the spell damage in descending order
    spells.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Calculate the sum of the top `totalSpells` values
    let totalDamage = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(totalSpells, spells.length); i++) {
        totalDamage += spells[i];
    }
    
    return totalDamage;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(maxTotalDamage([3, 6, 2, 8, 7], 3)); // Outputs: 21
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `spells` array has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of spells.
- Summing the top `totalSpells` values has a time complexity of \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of spells we are allowed to cast.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
