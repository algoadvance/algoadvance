### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 137: Single Number II**

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears exactly three times except for one element which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we dive into coding, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Input Size and Limits**: What is the range of the input size? Are there any constraints on the integers (e.g., negative numbers, very large numbers)?
   - Typically, the number of integers can be in the range of `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`, and the integer values can be within `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`.

2. **Output**: We are expected to return the single number which appears exactly once. Are there any other edge cases we should consider (e.g., empty array, invalid input)?

Assuming the array is valid as per the problem statement, we can proceed with the strategy.

### Strategy

To achieve linear runtime complexity (`O(n)`) and use constant extra space (`O(1)`), we can utilize bitwise operations. Specifically, we will use bitwise manipulation to count the number of 1s and 0s at each bit position for all numbers in the array.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize two variables `ones` and `twos` to store the bits that are seen once and twice respectively.
2. Iterate through each number in the array.
3. Update `ones` and `twos` based on the current number, making sure to reset bits that occur three times.

The main idea is to use bitwise operations to keep track of the bits that have appeared once and twice, and reset the counts of bits that have appeared three times.

### Code

```javascript
function singleNumber(nums) {
    // Initialize variables to hold bits seen one and two times
    let ones = 0, twos = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        // Update 'ones' with the new number, and only keep bits that are
        // currently not in 'twos' (since bits in 'twos' should not be added to 'ones')
        ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos;

        // Update 'twos' with the new number, and only keep bits that are
        // currently not in 'ones' (since bits in 'ones' should not be added to 'twos')
        twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones;
    }

    // 'ones' will hold the bits of the unique number
    return ones;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We process each element of the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, we use a constant amount of extra space (variables `ones` and `twos`).

This solution efficiently finds the single number that appears exactly once while other numbers appear exactly three times, satisfying the problem's constraints on linear runtime and constant space.
