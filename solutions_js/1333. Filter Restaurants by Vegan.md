[Leetcode 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1333)
### Problem Statement

Given the array `restaurants` where restaurants[i] = [id_i, rating_i, veganFriendly_i, price_i, distance_i]. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters:

- veganFriendly with value being either 0 (no restriction) or 1 (only vegan-friendly restaurants).
- maxPrice which is the maximum value for the restaurant's price.
- maxDistance which is the maximum value for the restaurant's distance.

Filter the restaurants using the three given filters, then return the result sorted by rating from highest to lowest. If two restaurants have the same rating, sort them by id from highest to lowest. 

Input: 
- `restaurants`: a list of restaurants information.
- `veganFriendly`: an indicator where 1 indicates to filter only vegan-friendly restaurants, and 0 indicates there are no dietary restrictions.
- `maxPrice`: maximum value for the price of a restaurant.
- `maxDistance`: maximum value for the distance of a restaurant.

Output:
- Return the restaurant ids sorted as specified.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can any fields of the input arrays (like ids, ratings, etc.) ever be negative?
   - No, values should be non-negative.
   
2. Are we guaranteed that the input list of restaurants is not empty?
   - No, it can be empty, and the result should be an empty list in that case.

### Strategy

1. **Filter According to the Given Constraints**:
   - If `veganFriendly` is 1, filter only vegan-friendly restaurants.
   - Filter restaurants with a `price` less than or equal to `maxPrice`.
   - Filter restaurants with a `distance` less than or equal to `maxDistance`.

2. **Sort the Filtered List**:
   - Sort the filtered restaurants first by `rating` in descending order.
   - For restaurants with the same rating, sort by `id` in descending order.

3. **Extract the Ids**:
   - Gather the `id`s of the remaining restaurants after filtering and sorting.

### Code

```javascript
function filterRestaurants(restaurants, veganFriendly, maxPrice, maxDistance) {
    return restaurants.filter(restaurant => {
        const [id, rating, vegan, price, distance] = restaurant; 
        if (veganFriendly && vegan !== 1) return false;
        if (price > maxPrice) return false;
        if (distance > maxDistance) return false;
        return true;
    }).sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[1] !== b[1]) return b[1] - a[1]; // Compare ratings, higher first
        return b[0] - a[0]; // Compare ids, higher first
    }).map(restaurant => restaurant[0]);
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Filtering**:
   - The filtering step iterates through the list once, so it takes `O(n)` where `n` is the number of restaurants.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The sorting step involves sorting the filtered list, which takes `O(m log m)` in the average and worst-case scenarios where `m` is the number of filtered restaurants.

3. **Map**:
   - The mapping step iterates through the sorted list once, so it takes `O(m)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is `O(m log m)`.
