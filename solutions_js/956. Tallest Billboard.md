[Leetcode 956. Tallest Billboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l956)
## Problem Statement

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two support stands on each side, which must be of equal height. You are provided with a list of rods where each rod can either contribute to increasing the height of the left or right stand or might not be used at all.

You need to find the tallest possible height of the billboard such that the heights of the two supports are equal.

Given an array `rods` where `rods[i]` represents the height of the `i-th` rod, return the largest possible height of the billboard with the required conditions.

### Example:

```
Input: rods = [1,2,3,6]
Output: 6

Input: rods = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 10

Input: rods = [1,2]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= rods.length <= 20`
- `1 <= rods[i] <= 1000`
- The sum of `rods` is less than or equal to `5000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can rods only be used whole, or can they be split into smaller parts?
2. Are there any memory consumption constraints to consider for the solution?

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming:

1. **Difference in Heights**: Let's use a dynamic programming map `dp` where `dp[difference]` represents the maximum possible height of one of the supports when the height difference between left and right stands is `difference`.
2. **Initialization**: Start with `dp = {0: 0}` meaning a difference of 0 height can be achieved with a height of 0.
3. **Updating States**:
    - Iterate over each rod and update the `dp` map. 
    - For each rod, calculate new possible states and update the dp map.
4. **Consider Three Decisions for Each Rod:**
    - Add the rod to the left stand.
    - Add the rod to the right stand.
    - Skip the rod.

The implementation will involve iterating through each rod and updating the dp dictionary to reflect the possible new states.

## Code

```javascript
var tallestBillboard = function(rods) {
    let dp = {0: 0};
    
    for (let rod of rods) {
        let current = {...dp};
        for (let diff in current) {
            diff = parseInt(diff);
            // Option 1: Add to the left support.
            dp[diff + rod] = Math.max(dp[diff + rod] || 0, current[diff]);
            // Option 2: Add to the right support.
            let leftSupport = current[diff];
            let rightSupport = current[diff] + rod;
            dp[Math.abs(leftSupport - rightSupport)] = Math.max(dp[Math.abs(leftSupport - rightSupport)] || 0, Math.max(leftSupport, rightSupport));
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0] || 0;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n * S)** where:
- `n` is the number of rods.
- `S` is the sum of all rod lengths which can be at most 5000.

Given the problem constraints, this recursive approach with memoization effectively balances performance and correctness, making it a suitable solution.
