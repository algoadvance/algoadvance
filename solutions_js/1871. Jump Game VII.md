[Leetcode 1871. Jump Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1871)
## Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the binary string `s`, a `0` represents a position you can stand on and a `1` represents a position you cannot stand on. Initially, you are standing on the position `0` (i.e., `s[0]` is '0'). You can only move to a position `j` from position `i` if the following conditions are met:
  
1. `i + minJump <= j <= i + maxJump`
2. `s[j] == '0'`

Return `true` if you can reach the last index of the string, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the length of `s`?**
   - Length of `s` can be up to `10^6`.

2. **Values of `minJump` and `maxJump`?**
   - 1 <= `minJump` <= `maxJump` < length of `s`

3. **Structure of the input string?**
   - The string `s` consists only of '0's and '1's.

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The basic idea is to traverse through the valid positions using a queue and mark those positions as visited to avoid redundant checks.

1. We initialize with position `0` in the queue.
2. For each position `i`, we check every position from `i + minJump` to `min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)`.
3. If we find that the position `s[j]` is `0`, we add it to the queue for further exploration.
4. We keep track of the maximum position already checked to avoid redundant operations.
5. If we reach the last index of string `s`, return `true`.
6. If the queue is empty and we haven't reached the last index, return `false`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} minJump
 * @param {number} maxJump
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canReach = function(s, minJump, maxJump) {
    let n = s.length;
    let queue = [0];
    let farthest = 0;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let currentIndex = queue.shift();
        
        for (let j = Math.max(currentIndex + minJump, farthest + 1); j <= Math.min(currentIndex + maxJump, n - 1); j++) {
            if (s[j] === '0') {
                if (j === n - 1) {
                    return true;
                }
                queue.push(j);
            }
        }
        farthest = Math.max(farthest, currentIndex + maxJump);
    }
    return false;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of string `s`. This is because each position in the string is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage required for the BFS queue and other auxiliary data structures.

By implementing this approach, we efficiently explore only valid jump paths and ensure we only visit each position once, making the algorithm optimal for the given constraints.
