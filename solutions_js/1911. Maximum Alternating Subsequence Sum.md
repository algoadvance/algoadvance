[Leetcode 1911. Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1911)
# Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is called alternating if its elements alternately increase and decrease (excluding equal elements). Calculate the maximum sum of any alternating subsequence in `nums`.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: [4, 5, 3] is alternating, and its sum is 4 + 5 - 3 = 7.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8]
Output: 8
Explanation: [8] is the only alternating subsequence.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [6,2,1,2,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: [6, 1, 5] is the maximum alternating subsequence, and its sum is 6 - 1 + 5 = 10.
```

# Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` be empty?
2. Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
3. What are the size constraints for `nums`?

# Code

```javascript
function maxAlternatingSum(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    let odd = 0, even = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        // Temporarily store the current odd before updating it
        let newOdd = Math.max(odd, even - nums[i]);
        // Update even using the maximum of previous even and adding the current number to odd
        even = Math.max(even, odd + nums[i]);
        odd = newOdd;
    }
    
    return even;
}
```

# Strategy

1. **Initialize State Variables**: We'll use two variables `even` and `odd` to keep track of the maximum sum where `even` represents the sum ending at an even index and `odd` represents the sum ending at an odd index.
   - Initialize `even` with the first element because the maximal alternating sum starting with the first element (an even index in 0-based counting) is the element itself.
   - Initialize `odd` as `0` because there is no odd indexed element at the start.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Loop through the array starting from the second element (index `1`).
   - For each element, calculate the new possible values for `odd` and `even`.
   - `even` at any position can be either:
     - Its previous value, meaning we skip the current element.
     - `odd + current element`, meaning we're considering the current element as part of the alternating sequence.
   - `odd` at any position can be either:
     - Its previous value, meaning we skip the current element.
     - `even - current element`, meaning we're considering the current element as part of the alternating sequence.

3. **Return Result**: The maximum alternating sum is stored in `even` since the sequence starts with an even index.

# Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we only use a single loop to traverse through the array once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space (two variables).

This approach ensures that we compute the maximum alternating sum efficiently.
