[Leetcode 1995. Count Special Quadruplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1995)
## Problem Statement
1995. Count Special Quadruplets

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`, return the number of distinct quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` such that:
- `0 <= a < b < c < d < n`
- `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input array size `n`?**
   - The constraints usually provided will help determine whether a naive O(n^4) solution is feasible or if we need a more optimized one.
   
2. **Can `nums` contain negative integers?**
   - Knowing this helps us plan our approach, especially when dealing with sums.

3. **Are there any constraints on the magnitude of the elements in `nums`?**
   - This helps in estimating potential optimizations.

- Assuming:
  - `1 <= n <= 50`
  - `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

Given the constraint n ≤ 50, an O(n^4) solution might be feasible, but it's still better to consider optimized approaches if possible.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-Force Approach**:
   - Use four nested loops to check every possible combination of quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)`.
   - Check the condition `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]` and count the valid quadruplets.

2. **Optimized Approach Using Hashmaps**:
   - Use hashmaps to store possible sums and check against `nums[d]`.

Considering that `n <= 50`, let's start with a brute-force approach which is straightforward and simple to implement. If performance is an issue, we can later extend this to a more optimized solution.

## Code
```javascript

var countQuadruplets = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let n = nums.length;

    for (let a = 0; a < n - 3; a++) {
        for (let b = a + 1; b < n - 2; b++) {
            for (let c = b + 1; c < n - 1; c++) {
                for (let d = c + 1; d < n; d++) {
                    if (nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] === nums[d]) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The brute-force solution is O(n^4), where n is the length of the array `nums`. Given n ≤ 50, this results in at most 6,250,000 iterations, which is manageable within constraints.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This brute-force approach should work fine within the given constraints but is not the most optimal. If needed, an optimized solution using hashmaps can be explored.
