[Leetcode 377. Combination Sum IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l377)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to the target.

The order of the numbers in the combination does not matter. For example, with `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `target = 4`, the possible combinations are:
- 1, 1, 1, 1
- 1, 1, 2
- 1, 3
- 2, 2

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - No, `nums` will only contain positive integers.
2. Are the elements in `nums` unique?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the array `nums` contains distinct integers.
3. Can `target` be negative?
   - No, `target` will be a positive integer.

## Strategy
This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**:
   - Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations that sum up to `i`.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0]` should be `1` because there is only one way to make zero sum, i.e., choosing nothing.
   
3. **Iterate and Compute**:
   - For each number `i` from `1` to `target`, iterate through the elements of `nums`.
   - For each number `num` in `nums`, if `i - num` is non-negative, add the count of combinations to make `i - num` to `dp[i]`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The value at `dp[target]` will be our answer.

## Code
Here is the JavaScript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function combinationSum4(nums, target) {
    // Initialize the dp array with zeros
    let dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Base case: There's one way to obtain a sum of 0.
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    // Iterate over each value from 1 to target
    for (let i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
        for (let num of nums) {
            if (i - num >= 0) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - num];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The answer is the value of dp at index `target`
    return dp[target];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * target)`, where `n` is the length of `nums` and `target` is the target value. This is because we have two nested loops: one iterating through 1 to `target` and the other iterating through all elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(target)`, as we are using a single array `dp` of size `target + 1`.

This implementation ensures that we exhaustively count all the possible combinations effectively using dynamic programming.
