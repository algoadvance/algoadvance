[Leetcode 1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1128)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of dominoes, represented by pairs of integers, you need to determine the number of pairs of equivalent dominoes. Two dominoes are considered equivalent if one domino can be rotated to match the other. For example, the domino [1,2] is equivalent to the domino [2,1].

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - How many dominoes can there be in the list?
   - Are the integers in each domino pair constrained in any way?

2. **Output**:
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of equivalently paired dominoes.

### Code
Here's a solution to the problem.

```javascript
var numEquivDominoPairs = function(dominoes) {
    let map = new Map();
    let count = 0;
    
    // Process each domino
    for (let [a, b] of dominoes) {
        // Normalize by sorting the numbers
        let key = a < b ? `${a},${b}` : `${b},${a}`;
        
        // Count occurrences of each normalized domino pair
        if (map.has(key)) {
            count += map.get(key);
            map.set(key, map.get(key) + 1);
        } else {
            map.set(key, 1);
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Normalize the Domino Pairs**:
   - Each domino pair is sorted to ensure [a, b] and [b, a] are treated the same. This allows easy comparison.

2. **Use a Map to Count Occurrences**:
   - Use a HashMap to store the count of each normalized domino configuration.

3. **Calculate Equivalent Pairs**:
   - For each domino configuration stored in the map, if it appears n times, it can form `n * (n - 1) / 2` equivalent pairs. This is directly calculated during the iteration.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - We iterate through the list of dominoes once, which is O(n) where n is the number of dominoes.
  - Operations with the map (insert and retrieve) are average O(1), making the overall complexity O(n).

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - In the worst case, all dominoes could be unique after normalization, meaning we store up to n keys in the map, which requires O(n) space.
