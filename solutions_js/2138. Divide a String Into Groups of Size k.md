[Leetcode 2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2138)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to divide the string into groups of size `k`. If the last group is smaller than `k`, append extra characters (represented as `fill`) to make its size equal to `k`.

Write a function `divideString(s, k, fill)` that returns an array of strings, where each string is a group of size `k`.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
Output: ["abc","def","ghi"]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
Output: ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jxx"]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `fill` is a string of exactly one character.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `fill` always a single character?**
   - Yes, as stated in the constraints.

2. **What should be returned if `s` is empty?**
   - Given the constraints, `s` will not be empty.

3. **Is `s` always a lowercase English letter?**
   - The constraints do not specify this; hence, you can assume `s` could contain any characters.

## Code

```javascript
function divideString(s, k, fill) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i += k) {
        let chunk = s.substring(i, i + k);
        if (chunk.length < k) {
            chunk = chunk + fill.repeat(k - chunk.length);
        }
        result.push(chunk);
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(divideString("abcdefghi", 3, 'x')); // ["abc","def","ghi"]
console.log(divideString("abcdefghij", 3, 'x')); // ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jxx"]
```

## Strategy

1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the resulting groups.
2. Iterate over the string `s` in steps of size `k`:
    - For each step, extract a substring of length `k` starting at the current index.
    - If the extracted substring's length is less than `k`, append `fill` characters to make it of length `k`.
3. Push each processed substring into the `result` array.
4. Return the `result` array.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the entire string `s` once, performing constant-time operations for each segment.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the number of groups. The space is used to store the result array, which could at most have `(n + k - 1) // k` groups.
