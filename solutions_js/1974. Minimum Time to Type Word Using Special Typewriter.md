[Leetcode 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1974)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1974: Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter

The special typewriter has a circular keyboard with lowercase English letters arranged in a circle from 'a' to 'z' in a clockwise direction. The typewriter has a pointer initially pointing at the letter 'a'. 

* Each second, you can perform one of the following operations:
  - Move the pointer one character clockwise or counter-clockwise.
  - Type the character the pointer is currently on.

Given a string `word`, you need to return the minimum time to type the string.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, letâ€™s clarify a few questions:
1. Does the string `word` only contain lowercase English letters? *(Assuming yes since only lowercase English letters are mentioned).*
2. Is there any constraint on the length of the string `word`? *(The normal constraints from LeetCode are assumed unless specified, typically up to 10^4 characters).*

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Pointer:** Imagine a pointer on a circular keyboard starting at 'a'.
2. **Iterate through the Word:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - Calculate the distance clockwise and counterclockwise from the current position of the pointer to the desired character.
     - Move the pointer to the desired character, and update the total time by adding the minimum of the two calculated distances plus one second for typing the character.
3. **Calculate Distance:** Use modular arithmetic to find the minimal distance in a circular manner.
4. **Sum Up Time:** Keep a running total of the minimum time required for all characters in the string.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function minTimeToType(word) {
    let time = 0;
    let currentPosition = 0; // 'a' is at index 0

    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        let targetPosition = word.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        let clockwiseDistance = Math.abs(targetPosition - currentPosition);
        let counterClockwiseDistance = 26 - clockwiseDistance;
        time += Math.min(clockwiseDistance, counterClockwiseDistance) + 1;
        currentPosition = targetPosition;
    }
    return time;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `word`. This is because we iterate through each character of the word exactly once, processing each in constant time. Calculating distances and updating the time both take a constant time operation.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
