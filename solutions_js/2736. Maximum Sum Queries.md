[Leetcode 2736. Maximum Sum Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2736)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`, and an array `queries` containing `m` queries. Each query is represented by a pair of integers `[xi, yi]`. For each query, you need to find the maximum possible value of `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` such that `nums1[j] >= xi` and `nums2[j] >= yi`. If no such `j` exists, the answer to the query is `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries` all guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. What are the constraints on the values of `nums1`, `nums2`, and the queries?
3. Should the result for each query be returned in the same order as the queries?

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Method**: A straightforward solution involves iterating over each element in `nums1` and `nums2` for each query to check if they meet the conditions `nums1[j] >= xi` and `nums2[j] >= yi`, and then calculating the maximum sum. This approach can be quite inefficient for large inputs.
2. **Optimized Method**:
    - **Data Preprocessing**: Use a sorted list of pairs `(nums1[j], nums2[j])` to effectively manage and look up the sums that can meet the query conditions.
    - **Binary Search for Queries**: Use binary search on the sorted list for efficient querying of the sums.
    - **Data Structures**: Utilize appropriate data structures like segment trees, binary search trees, or heaps for efficient minimum-maximum range queries.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code implementing the brute force solution due to its simplicity. For large inputs, this code can be optimized using advanced data structures as mentioned in the strategy.

```javascript
function maximumSumQueries(nums1, nums2, queries) {
    const n = nums1.length;
    const m = queries.length;
    let result = new Array(m).fill(-1);

    // Process each query
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        const [xi, yi] = queries[i];
        let maxSum = -1;

        // Check every element in nums1 and nums2
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (nums1[j] >= xi && nums2[j] >= yi) {
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, nums1[j] + nums2[j]);
            }
        }

        result[i] = maxSum;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Strategy for Optimization

1. **Preprocess Arrays**: Sort `nums1` and `nums2` and keep track of the indices.
2. **Efficient Query Lookup**: Use data structures that allow efficient min/max range queries (like segment trees or balanced BSTs).
3. **Data Mapping**: Create mappings to retain original indices post sorting.

### Time Complexity

The brute force solution has a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of queries and \(n\) is the length of `nums1` and `nums2`.

For optimized solutions:
- **Preprocessing**: Sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Query Processing**: With segment trees or balanced BSTs, each query can be processed in \(O(\log n)\).

Thus, the optimized approach can achieve \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\) time complexity.
