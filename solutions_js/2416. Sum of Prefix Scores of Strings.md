[Leetcode 2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2416)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. A prefix score of a string is defined as the sum of the scores of all prefixes of that string. The score of a string is defined as the number of strings in the array `words` that have that string as a prefix. 

Return an array of integers containing the prefix scores of given strings. The prefix score of a string is the sum of scores of all its prefixes.

For example, if a word is "abc", its prefixes are "a", "ab", and "abc".

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that all strings in `words` only contain lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, all strings consist of lowercase English letters.

2. What should be the length of the output array?
   - The length of the output array should be the same as the length of the input array `words`.

3. Can the input `words` array be empty?
   - No, you can assume that the array will contain at least one string.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure Choice**: A Trie (prefix tree) will be suitable for this problem because we can store and count prefixes efficiently.
2. **Build the Trie**: As we insert each string into the Trie, we can also update the frequency of each prefix.
3. **Calculate Prefix Scores**: Traverse each word again and calculate the sum of the prefix scores using the Trie.

### Code

```javascript
class TrieNode {
    constructor() {
        this.children = {};
        this.frequency = 0;
    }
}

class Trie {
    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    insert(word) {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children[char]) {
                node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[char];
            node.frequency += 1;
        }
    }
    
    getPrefixScore(word) {
        let node = this.root;
        let prefixScore = 0;
        for (const char of word) {
            node = node.children[char];
            prefixScore += node.frequency;
        }
        return prefixScore;
    }
}

function sumPrefixScores(words) {
    const trie = new Trie();
    
    // Step 1: Insert all words into the Trie
    for (const word of words) {
        trie.insert(word);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the prefix scores for each word
    const result = [];
    for (const word of words) {
        result.push(trie.getPrefixScore(word));
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
const words = ["abc", "ab", "bc", "b"];
console.log(sumPrefixScores(words)); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion into the Trie**: O(M * N), where M is the length of the longest word and N is the number of words.
- **Calculating Prefix Scores**: O(M * N), since we are traversing each word to get the scores.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(M * N), which is efficient for this problem given the constraints.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the prefix scores using a Trie data structure, keeping the operations linear relative to the input size and the length of the strings.
