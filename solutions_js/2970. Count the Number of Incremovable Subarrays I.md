[Leetcode 2970. Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2970)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. A subarray is considered "incremovable" if you cannot obtain it from a strictly increasing rearrangement of its elements. Your task is to count the number of "incremovable" subarrays in the given array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Definition:** Is a subarray in this context defined as contiguous elements of the array?
    - **Answer:** Yes, in this context, a subarray refers to a contiguous segment of the array.
   
2. **Type of Subarray:** Are we only considering subarrays that cannot be obtained by any strictly increasing sequence, or only particular cases?
    - **Answer:** We consider any subarray where at least one element would need to be repositioned to achieve a strictly increasing order.

3. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the array's length and the values of the integers?
    - **Answer:** Typical constraints for problems like this might be:
        - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
        - `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
 
4. **Output:** Are we returning just the count of such subarrays?
    - **Answer:** Yes, we are returning only the count of "incremovable" subarrays.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll need to:

1. **Generate all possible subarrays:** For each subarray of the given array, check if it's strictly increasing.
2. **Check strictly increasing order:** For a subarray to be increasing, each element must be less than the next one. If this condition is violated, the subarray is "incremovable."
3. **Count those subarrays:** Maintain a count of the subarrays that don’t meet the strictly increasing criteria.

### Code

Here’s the JavaScript solution:

```javascript
function countIncremovableSubarrays(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Loop over all possible subarrays
    for (let start = 0; start < n; start++) {
        for (let end = start; end < n; end++) {
            let isIncreasing = true;
            // Check if the current subarray is strictly increasing
            for (let i = start; i < end; i++) {
                if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
                    isIncreasing = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            // If it's not strictly increasing, increment count
            if (!isIncreasing) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Test the function with an example input
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 4];
console.log(countIncremovableSubarrays(nums));  // Output: Should be the count of incremovable subarrays.
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach:
- The outer loop runs `O(n)` for the starting index.
- The second loop also runs `O(n)` for the ending index.
- Inside these loops, we check if the subarray is strictly increasing, which takes `O(n)` in the worst case.

Thus, the time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)`, which might not be efficient enough for constraints where `n` can be as large as `10^5`.

### Optimized Strategy

Given that the brute force has a high time complexity, an optimized approach should aim to identify segments that aren't strictly increasing and count subarrays related to these inefficiently.

Let’s consider optimizing the counting method instead of checking each subarray step-by-step.

### Optimized Code (Advanced):

```javascript
function countIncremovableSubarrays(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    const n = nums.length;

    // Initialize left and right arrays to store boundaries of increasing segments
    const left = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const right = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Compute left boundaries
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            left[i] = left[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Compute right boundaries
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
            right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Count the incremovable subarrays
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Length of the longest increasing subarray to the left starting at `i`
        let leftCount = left[i] + 1;
        // Length of the longest increasing subarray to the right starting at `i`
        let rightCount = right[i] + 1;

        // Total subarrays that include nums[i]
        let totalSubarrays = (leftCount * rightCount) - 1;

        // All the subarrays of length greater than 1 which are not increasable
        count += totalSubarrays;
    }

    return count;
}

// Test the function with an example input
const nums = [1, 3, 2, 4];
console.log(countIncremovableSubarrays(nums));  // Output: Should be the count of incremovable subarrays.
```

### Time Complexity (Optimized)

This optimized approach significantly reduces the computation:
- Initializing and computing left and right arrays: `O(n)`
- Counting using precomputed left and right arrays: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity becomes `O(n)`, making it efficient for large input sizes up to `10^5`.

With this optimized approach, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient for large input sizes.
