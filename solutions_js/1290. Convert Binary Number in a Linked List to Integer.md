[Leetcode 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1290)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list that contains a binary number. The task is to convert this binary number to an integer and return it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the linked list be empty?
   - No, the linked list will have at least one node as per the problem constraints.
2. Will the binary number fit within a 32-bit signed integer?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
3. Are there any characters other than '0' or '1' in the linked list?
   - No, the linked list consists solely of '0' and '1'.

### Strategy

1. Traverse the linked list from the head to the end.
2. For each node, shift the current result to the left by one bit (equivalent to multiplying by 2).
3. Add the current node's value (which is either 0 or 1) to the result.
4. Continue this process until all nodes have been processed.
5. Return the resulting integer.

### Code

```javascript
function getDecimalValue(head) {
    let num = 0;
    while (head !== null) {
        num = (num << 1) | head.val;
        head = head.next;
    }
    return num;
}
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize `num` to 0, which will hold the resultant integer value.
2. Traverse the linked list using a while loop until `head` becomes null:
    - Shift `num` one position to the left (`num << 1`). This operation is equivalent to multiplying `num` by 2.
    - Use the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to add the current node's value (`head.val`) to `num`.
    - Move to the next node (`head = head.next`).
3. After the loop ends, `num` will contain the integer value corresponding to the binary number represented by the linked list.
4. Return the computed integer value.

### Time Complexity

- Traversing the linked list takes O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a few extra variables.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
