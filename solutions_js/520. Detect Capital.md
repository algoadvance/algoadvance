[Leetcode 520. Detect Capital](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l520)
### Problem Statement

Given a word, you need to determine if the usage of capitals in it is correct. We define the usage of capitals in a word to be correct when one of the following cases holds:
1. All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
2. All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
3. Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Return `true` if the capital usage in the given word is right, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is the input always a single word?
   - **A:** Yes, the input is always a single word.
  
2. **Q:** Can the word be an empty string?
   - **A:** No, according to the problem, the input will always be a word, so it will have at least one character.
   
3. **Q:** Is the word case-sensitive?
   - **A:** Yes, capital and lowercase letters are treated differently as per the problem statement.

### Strategy

We can determine the correctness of the capitalization using basic string methods in JavaScript. We will check for the three scenarios:
1. All letters in the word are uppercase.
2. All letters in the word are lowercase.
3. Only the first letter is uppercase, and the rest are lowercase.

We can use the following functions:
- `toUpperCase()`: To convert the entire string to uppercase.
- `toLowerCase()`: To convert the entire string to lowercase.
- Character checking using `charAt(0)`.

### Code

```javascript
function detectCapitalUse(word) {
    if (word === word.toUpperCase()) return true;
    if (word === word.toLowerCase()) return true;
    if (word.charAt(0) === word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() && word.slice(1) === word.slice(1).toLowerCase()) return true;
    return false;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Check if all letters are uppercase:** 
   ```javascript
   if (word === word.toUpperCase()) return true;
   ```
   Here, if the word is the same as its uppercase version, all letters are uppercase.

2. **Check if all letters are lowercase:** 
   ```javascript
   if (word === word.toLowerCase()) return true;
   ```
   Similarly, if the word is the same as its lowercase version, all letters are lowercase.

3. **Check if only the first letter is uppercase and the rest are lowercase:**
   ```javascript
   if (word.charAt(0) === word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() && word.slice(1) === word.slice(1).toLowerCase()) return true;
   ```
   Here, `word.charAt(0)` gives the first character of the word. We check if the first character is uppercase and the rest of the substring from the second character are all lowercase.

4. **If none of the above conditions are met, return false:**
   ```javascript
   return false;
   ```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the word. This is because the `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `charAt()`, and `slice()` methods each run in linear time relative to the length of the input string.

Additionally, converting the string to all uppercase or lowercase, and performing the comparisons are linear operations, making the overall time complexity O(n).
