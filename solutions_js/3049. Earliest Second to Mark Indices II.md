[Leetcode 3049. Earliest Second to Mark Indices II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3049)
Sure, let's break down the solution step-by-step.

## Problem Statement

We need to solve a problem on LeetCode (hypothetically numbered 3049):

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to find the earliest time (in terms of indices) when exactly `k` different indices will have been marked. Initially, the marked indices are empty.

Each second `i` marks the element at index `arr[i]`. In other words, the integer at each position in `arr` determines the index to be marked at that moment. You have to return the earliest second `j` after which exactly `k` different indices have been marked.

### Example

For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4]` and `k = 3`, the earliest second where exactly 3 indices are marked can be determined by the indices `1`, `2`, and `3`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and the value of `k`?**
   - This will help us understand if there are any performance concerns.
   
2. **Are there guarantees on the values within `arr`?**
   - For example, are the values within a certain range?

3. **What should be returned if `k` is larger than the possible unique indices in `arr`?**
   - This can guide how we deal with corner cases.

Assuming typical constraints and that `k` is valid for the array:

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a Set** to keep track of marked indices.
2. **Iterate through the array** `arr` and mark the indices as specified by the values in `arr`.
3. **Track the earliest second** when the count of unique marked indices reaches `k`.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize a set `markedIndices` to keep track of unique indices being marked.
2. Iterate over each element in `arr` while tracking the index with a variable, say `time`.
3. For each element `arr[time]`, add the corresponding index to `markedIndices`.
4. Check the size of `markedIndices` during each iteration. If the size becomes equal to `k`, return `time` as the earliest second.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `arr`. Each insertion and lookup in a set is average \(O(1)\), making this efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), for storing up to `k` indices in the `markedIndices` set.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code implementing the strategy:

```javascript
function earliestSecondToMarkIndices(arr, k) {
    const markedIndices = new Set();
    
    for (let time = 0; time < arr.length; time++) {
        markedIndices.add(arr[time]);
        
        if (markedIndices.size === k) {
            return time;
        }
    }
    
    // Return -1 if it's not possible to mark k different indices
    return -1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(earliestSecondToMarkIndices([1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4], 3));  // Output: 3
```

In this example:
- Initially, marked indices are `{}`.
- At time 0: Mark index 1, marked indices are `{1}`.
- At time 1: Mark index 2, marked indices are `{1, 2}`.
- At time 2: Mark index 1 again (no change).
- At time 3: Mark index 3, marked indices are `{1, 2, 3}`, which are 3 unique indices.

Thus, the function should return `3`, which is the earliest second where exactly 3 unique indices have been marked.
