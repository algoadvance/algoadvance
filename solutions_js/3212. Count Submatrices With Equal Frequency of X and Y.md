[Leetcode 3212. Count Submatrices With Equal Frequency of X and Y](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3212)
## Problem Statement
You are given a matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and two integers `X` and `Y`. You need to count the number of submatrices where the frequency of `X` and `Y` elements is equal.

Here's how the function signature will look like in JavaScript:

```javascript
var countSubmatricesWithEqualFrequency = function(matrix, X, Y) {
    // Your code here
};
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the matrix contain negative numbers?**
   - No, for simplicity assume the matrix only contains non-negative integers.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the matrix and the values of m, n, X, and Y?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems might be `1 <= m, n <= 100`.
   
3. **Are m and n equal?**
   - No assumption should be made; the matrix can be any rectangular shape.

4. **Are the values of X and Y guaranteed to be in the matrix?**
   - No, they may or may not be present.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a sliding window-like approach to count the number of submatrices with an equal number of `X` and `Y`. Here's the plan:

1. Loop over all possible top-left corners of submatrices.
2. Loop over all possible bottom-right corners of submatrices.
3. For each submatrix determined by the corners, count the number of X's and Y's.
4. If the count of X's is equal to Y's, increment the count.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var countSubmatricesWithEqualFrequency = function(matrix, X, Y) {
    let m = matrix.length;
    let n = matrix[0].length;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let row1 = 0; row1 < m; row1++) {
        for (let col1 = 0; col1 < n; col1++) {
            for (let row2 = row1; row2 < m; row2++) {
                for (let col2 = col1; col2 < n; col2++) {
                    let freqX = 0;
                    let freqY = 0;
                    
                    for (let i = row1; i <= row2; i++) {
                        for (let j = col1; j <= col2; j++) {
                            if (matrix[i][j] === X) freqX++;
                            if (matrix[i][j] === Y) freqY++;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    if (freqX === freqY) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- Generating all possible submatrices: O(m^2 * n^2)
  - Two nested loops for the top-left corners: O(m * n)
  - Two nested loops for the bottom-right corners: O(m * n)
- Counting elements within a submatrix: O(m * n) in the worst case for each submatrix

Total complexity: O(m^3 * n^3)

This complexity might not be optimal, but it is straightforward. In a real-world scenario, further optimization might be necessary for larger input sizes.
