[Leetcode 1424. Diagonal Traverse II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1424)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of lists of integers, `nums`, return all elements of `nums` in diagonal order as described below.

Each of the diagonals will begin at the first element of any row or any column. The traversal should go from top-left to bottom-right diagonally, all the way to the end of `nums`.

#### Example:
- Input: `nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
- Output: `[1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the sublists of varying lengths?**
   - Yes, some sublists can be shorter or longer than others.
2. **Is the given `nums` non-empty?**
   - Yes, it's guaranteed that `nums` contains at least one element.

### Strategy
1. **Organize the Elements by Diagonals**:
   - Utilize a map to collect elements by their diagonals. Keys of the map will be the sum of the current row index and column index (`i + j`). All elements with the same `i + j` are on the same diagonal.
2. **Extract and Concatenate Results**:
   - Once all elements are categorized, extract them from the map in order of their diagonal's keys and concatenate the results into a single list.

### Code
Here's the JavaScript function to accomplish this:

```javascript
function findDiagonalOrder(nums) {
    let diagonals = new Map();
    let maxDiagonal = 0;

    // Collect elements into diagonals
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < nums[i].length; j++) {
            let diagonalKey = i + j;
            if (!diagonals.has(diagonalKey)) {
                diagonals.set(diagonalKey, []);
            }
            diagonals.get(diagonalKey).push(nums[i][j]);
            maxDiagonal = Math.max(maxDiagonal, diagonalKey);
        }
    }
    
    // Construct the result from the diagonals
    let result = [];
    for (let k = 0; k <= maxDiagonal; k++) {
        if (diagonals.has(k)) {
            result.push(...diagonals.get(k));
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Collection into diagonals**: Each element is visited once, leading to `O(N)` where `N` is the total number of elements in `nums`.
- **Extraction from diagonals**: Iterates over each diagonal and each element within them, again leading to `O(N)`.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in `nums`. 

This solution efficiently traverses `nums` and categorizes elements by diagonal, ensuring optimal performance.
