[Leetcode 1175. Prime Arrangements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1175)
Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, you need to return the number of permutations of the first `n` positive integers that are prime in the prime indices (1-indexed).

For example, if `n = 5`, we have the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. On positions {2, 3, 5} (which are prime indices), the numbers must be prime. 

Return the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of `n`?
   - `1 <= n <= 100`.

2. Are there specific constraints or edge cases we should consider?
   - Yes, the constraints are set such that `n` can sometimes be small (where enumerating permutations manually may be feasible), and sometimes larger. Calculating prime numbers efficiently will be crucial.

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Prime Numbers within the Range**:
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify all prime numbers up to `n`.

2. **Count Prime and Non-Prime Indices**:
   - Determine which indices (up to `n`) are prime indices and count how many there are.

3. **Calculate Permutations**:
   - Use factorial calculations to determine permutations of prime and non-prime indexed elements in their respective places.
   - The formula will effectively be the factorial of the number of prime-indexed positions multiplied by the factorial of the number of non-prime indexed positions.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the output needs to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\), ensure intermediate results are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code:

```javascript
const MOD = 1000000007;

function numPrimeArrangements(n) {
    // Helper function to calculate factorial with modulo
    function factorial(x) {
        let result = 1;
        for (let i = 2; i <= x; i++) {
            result = (result * i) % MOD;
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify primes up to n
    function sieve(n) {
        let isPrime = Array(n + 1).fill(true);
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not prime
        
        for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                for (let j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return isPrime;
    }

    // Get primes up to n
    const isPrime = sieve(n);

    // Count prime indices
    let primeCount = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) primeCount++;
    }

    // Calculate factorial of prime indexed positions count and non-prime count
    let nonPrimeCount = n - primeCount;

    return (factorial(primeCount) * factorial(nonPrimeCount)) % MOD;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: \(O(n \log \log n)\)
2. **Factorial Calculation**: \(O(n)\)
   
Combining these, the overall time complexity is dominated by \(O(n \log \log n)\), which is efficient for `n` up to 100.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the number of valid permutations of `n` positive integers where primes are correctly placed at prime indices.
