[Leetcode 2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2419)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the length of the longest subarray in which all the elements have the same bitwise AND value as the maximum bitwise AND value of all the elements in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in `nums`**: What is the range of the values in the `nums` array?
   - Typically, the values are within the range of typical integers in JavaScript.

2. **Array length**: What is the typical size range of the `nums` array? 
   - Let's assume the size can be large since it's a LeetCode problem, so we might need to consider efficiency.

3. **Content of the array**: Can the array contain negative numbers, or is it restricted to non-negative integers?
   - For bitwise operations, the input will generally be non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Maximum AND Value**:
   - First, find the maximum number in the `nums` array which will be used to calculate the maximum bitwise AND value.

2. **Identify the Longest Subarray**:
   - Iterate through the array while keeping track of the longest subarray where every element has the same bitwise AND value as the maximum bitwise AND value of the entire array.
   - Utilize a sliding window or two-pointer technique to identify subarrays and compare elements' bitwise AND values with the maximum bitwise AND value.

### Implementation

Here is how we can implement this:

```javascript
function longestSubarray(nums) {
    let maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    let maxAndValue = maxNum; // max value in nums is max AND value
    
    // We are now looking for the longest subarray of elements each of which ANDs to the maxAndValue
    let currentLength = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if ((num & maxAndValue) === maxAndValue) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 0;
        }
    }
    
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength); // To account for ending streak
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the max number**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.
- **Iterating through the array to find the longest subarray**: \(O(n)\).

So the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Summary

- We first determine the maximum bitwise AND value by finding the maximum number in the array.
- We then iterate through the array to find the longest contiguous subarray where each element's AND with the maximum number equals the maximum number itself.
- This implementation ensures we get the solution with a linear time complexity \(O(n)\), which is efficient given the potential size of the input array.
