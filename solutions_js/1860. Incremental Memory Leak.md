[Leetcode 1860. Incremental Memory Leak](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1860)
### Problem Statement
1860. Incremental Memory Leak-out

Suppose you have two memory slots, `memory1` and `memory2` with their sizes represented by `memory1` and `memory2` respectively. Initially, the values of `memory1` and `memory2` are non-negative integers.

You will perform a series of memory allocations. The memory allocations happen in the following way:
- On the 1st second, you'll allocate 1 unit of memory.
- On the 2nd second, you'll allocate 2 units of memory.
- And so on.

If `memory1` is greater than or equal to `memory2`, allocate memory to `memory1`. Otherwise, allocate memory to `memory2`.

If a memory slot runs out of memory or cannot accommodate the current allocation, stop the allocation process.

Return an array containing `[t, memory1, memory2]` where `t` is the total number of seconds you have performed the allocation, and `memory1` and `memory2` are the remaining sizes of the memory slots.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done if both memory slots are exhausted at the same time?
   - The allocation process should stop as soon as either of the slots cannot accommodate the current allocation.

2. Are the initial sizes of `memory1` and `memory2` always non-negative?
   - Yes, they are always non-negative integers.

3. How should we handle the situation when both memory slots are equal?
   - Allocate to `memory1` if both are equal.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Initialize a variable `t` to denote the current second.
2. Run a loop starting with `t=1`.
3. In each iteration, determine which memory slot to allocate to based on the current state.
4. Deduct the allocation from the chosen memory slot.
5. Check if the chosen memory slot can accommodate the next allocation.
6. If neither slot can accommodate the current allocation, break the loop and return the result.

### Code

```javascript
function memLeak(memory1, memory2) {
    let t = 1;
    
    while (true) {
        if (memory1 >= memory2) {
            if (memory1 < t) break;
            memory1 -= t;
        } else {
            if (memory2 < t) break;
            memory2 -= t;
        }
        t++;
    }
    
    return [t, memory1, memory2];
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(sqrt(N))`, where `N` is the initial value of `memory1` or `memory2` (whichever is larger). This is because the iterations will roughly proceed until the current second `t` such that the sum of natural numbers `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + t` exceeds `N`, which happens around `t^2 â‰ˆ N`.
