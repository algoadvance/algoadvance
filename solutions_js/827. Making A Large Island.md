[Leetcode 827. Making A Large Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l827)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change **at most one** `0` to a `1`. Return the size of the largest island in `grid` after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one `0` to `1` to have a 2x2 island, and finally the largest island has a size of 3.

Input: grid = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change one `0` to `1` to have a large island with a size of 4.

Input: grid = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: There's no need to change because the entire grid is already an island.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - What is the range of `n`? `The constraint n will be in range 1 <= n <= 500.`
   - Is the grid guaranteed to have at least one `0`? `No, the grid could be all 1s, in which case the entire grid is the answer.`
   
### Strategy
1. **Initial Observation:**
   - Without any operation, we can calculate the size of all existing islands.
   - Changing one `0` to `1` can potentially merge two or more islands.

2. **Steps to Solve:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to find all islands and assign each island a unique ID while storing their sizes.
   - Iterate through each `0`, and check the sizes of unique island IDs surrounding it.
   - Keep track of the maximum size obtained by changing a single `0` to `1`.

### Code

```javascript
var largestIsland = function(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    
    const getId = (x, y) => x * n + y;
    
    let islandId = 2; // Start island ID from 2 as grid already has 1s and 0s
    
    const islandSizeMap = new Map(); // Key: islandId, Value: size of the island
    
    const dfs = (x, y, id) => {
        const stack = [[x, y]];
        let size = 0;
        while (stack.length) {
            const [cx, cy] = stack.pop();
            grid[cx][cy] = id;
            size++;
            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const nx = cx + dx, ny = cy + dy;
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < n && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] === 1) {
                    grid[nx][ny] = id;
                    stack.push([nx, ny]);
                }
            }
        }
        islandSizeMap.set(id, size);
    };
    
    // Step 1: DFS to label all islands and calculate sizes
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                dfs(i, j, islandId);
                islandId++;
            }
        }
    }

    // If grid is all 1s, return the total number of cells
    if (islandSizeMap.size === 0) return n * n;

    let maxSize = Math.max(...islandSizeMap.values());
    
    // Step 2: Check each 0 cell to find possible larger island
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                const seenIds = new Set();
                let combinedSize = 1;
                for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                    const nx = i + dx, ny = j + dy;
                    if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < n && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] > 1) {
                        const id = grid[nx][ny];
                        if (!seenIds.has(id)) {
                            seenIds.add(id);
                            combinedSize += islandSizeMap.get(id);
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, combinedSize);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxSize;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **DFS Approach:** Each cell is visited once, so the initial DFS run is `O(n^2)`.
- **ID Checking for `0`s:** Each zero in the grid is checked against up to 4 directions, hence the complexity for this step is also `O(n^2)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`.
