[Leetcode 939. Minimum Area Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l939)
### Problem Statement

We are provided with an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the *X-Y plane*. We need to determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed by any four of these points. Note that the rectangle must align with the coordinate axes, meaning its sides are parallel to the x and y axes respectively. If no rectangle can be formed, the function should return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicate Points:** Are there duplicate points in the provided input list?
   - Typically, there should not be duplicate points in such competitive programming problems.
   
2. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the number of points and their coordinates?
   - Standard constraints as inferred from Leetcode problems can be assumed.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var minAreaRect = function(points) {
    let pointSet = new Set();
    for (let point of points) {
        pointSet.add(`${point[0]}#${point[1]}`);
    }

    let minArea = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            let x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            let x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];

            if (x1 !== x2 && y1 !== y2) {
                if (pointSet.has(`${x1}#${y2}`) && pointSet.has(`${x2}#${y1}`)) {
                    let area = Math.abs(x2 - x1) * Math.abs(y2 - y1);
                    minArea = Math.min(minArea, area);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minArea === Infinity ? 0 : minArea;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Data Storage:** Use a Set for quick point existence checks. Each point will be stored in the format `x#y` in the Set to uniquely identify it.

2. **Pairing Points:** Use two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of points. Each pair of points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` can potentially be diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle if `x1 ≠ x2` and `y1 ≠ y2`.

3. **Rectangle Validation:** For the rectangle to form, we should have the other two points available:
   - `(x1, y2)` and `(x2, y1)`.
   - Check if these points exist in the Set.

4. **Calculate Area:** If the rectangle is valid, calculate the area: `|x2 - x1| * |y2 - y1|` and update the minimum area if it's the smallest found so far.

5. **Final Result:** After examining all pairs, if no rectangle has been found, return 0; otherwise, return the minimum area.

### Time Complexity

- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the number of points provided.
  - This is due to the nested loops iterating over pairs of points.
  - The Set operations (add and check existence) are average O(1) operations.

This approach efficiently verifies the existence of rectangles and computes the smallest possible area, meeting the problem constraints and requirements.
