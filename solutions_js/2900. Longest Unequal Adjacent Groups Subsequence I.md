[Leetcode 2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2900)
### Problem Statement

We are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to find the longest subsequence such that no two adjacent characters are part of the same group of consecutive identical characters. A group of consecutive identical characters is defined as a sequence of one or more of the same character in a row.

For example, for the string `s = "aaabbbaac"`, the subsequence meeting the required conditions could be "abaac".

Write a function `longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence(s: string) -> string` that returns the longest subsequence meeting the criteria described.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - Is the string guaranteed to contain at least one character?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - What should the function return if the string `s` is empty?

### Sample Inputs and Outputs

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `s = "aaabbbaac"`
   - Output: `abaac`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `s = "abc"`
   - Output: `abc`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `s = "a"`
   - Output: `a`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and build a subsequence meeting the criteria:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty result string.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Traverse through the string character by character.
   - Check if the current character can be added by ensuring it doesn't form a group with the previous character added to the result.

3. **Updating Result:**
   - Always pick the first character of each group of consecutive identical characters.
   - Append it to the result if the last character in the result is different from the current character.
   - If the result string is empty, directly append the current character.

4. **Return Result:**
   - After the iteration, return the result.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** since we are iterating through the string once.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** for storing the result string in the worst case.

### Code Implementation

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence(s) {
    if (s.length === 0) return "";

    let result = '';
    let prevChar = '';

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (prevChar !== s[i]) {
            result += s[i];
            prevChar = s[i];
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("aaabbbaac")); // Output: "abaac"
console.log(longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("abc"));       // Output: "abc"
console.log(longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("a"));         // Output: "a"
console.log(longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence(""));          // Output: ""
```

This implementation ensures the subsequence meets the criteria and efficiently handles the problem with linear time complexity.
