[Leetcode 2818. Apply Operations to Maximize Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2818)
### Problem Statement

2818. **Apply Operations to Maximize Score**

You are given a list of operations and an integer array `nums`. You need to apply these operations to `nums` to maximize a computed score. Each operation consists of choosing an element from `nums` and applying a mathematical function to it which changes its value and contributes to the score. You must maximize the final score after all operations have been applied.

The formal specification is not provided, but based on usual problem settings, let's assume:
- You may have several types of operations (add, multiply, modulo, etc.)
- You'll apply these operations in such an order as to maximize the sum of the results of these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the specific operations available?
2. Can each operation be used any number of times, or is there a limit?
3. Are there additional constraints on the length of the array or values within it?
4. Do the operations change the value in place, or do they just contribute a score while keeping the original values intact?

Given these questions aren't answered yet, I'll provide a generic strategy and a sample code based on an assumed setup. Let's assume we have the following operations:
- Add a constant (e.g., `+3`)
- Multiply by a constant (e.g., `*2`)
- Modulo by a constant (e.g., `%5`)

### Strategy

1. **Initial Assumption**: Consider all operations can be applied to each element in any number of times.
2. **Greedy Approach**: For maximization, prioritize the operations that yield the highest immediate increase in score.
3. **Heap/Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to always apply the best current operation to the highest current value.

### Code

```javascript
function maximizeScore(operations, nums) {
    // Priority Queue to keep track of the best choices (could use max-heap structure)
    let maxHeap = new MaxHeap();
    
    // Initialize the heap with original elements and their best possible operations
    for (let num of nums) {
        for (let op of operations) {
            let score = applyOperation(num, op);
            maxHeap.insert({value: score, num: num, op: op});
        }
    }
    
    let totalScore = 0;
    
    while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
        let { value, num, op } = maxHeap.extractMax();
        totalScore += value;
        num = applyOperation(num, op); // Apply the operation to the current number
        for (let nextOp of operations) {
            let nextScore = applyOperation(num, nextOp);
            maxHeap.insert({value: nextScore, num: num, nextOp: nextOp});
        }
    }
    
    return totalScore;
}

function applyOperation(num, op) {
    switch(op.type) {
        case 'add': return num + op.value;
        case 'multiply': return num * op.value;
        case 'modulo': return num % op.value;
        default: return num;
    }
}

class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    insert(val) {
        // Add to the heap
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.bubbleUp();
    }
    
    extractMax() {
        // Remove and return the max element
        let max = this.heap[0];
        let end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this.sinkDown(0);
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    bubbleUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        let element = this.heap[index];
        
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            let parent = this.heap[parentIndex];
            
            if (element.value <= parent.value) break;
            this.heap[index] = parent; 
            this.heap[parentIndex] = element;
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    sinkDown(index) {
        let length = this.heap.length;
        let element = this.heap[index];
        
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIdx = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIdx = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;
            
            if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIdx];
                if (leftChild.value > element.value) {
                    swap = leftChildIdx;
                }
            }
            if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIdx];
                if (
                    (swap === null && rightChild.value > element.value) || 
                    (swap !== null && rightChild.value > leftChild.value)
                ) {
                    swap = rightChildIdx;
                }
            }
            if (swap === null) break;
            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }
    
    isEmpty() {
        return this.heap.length === 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion/Extraction in MaxHeap**: \(O(\log n)\)
- **Overall Complexity**: Given the operations and the need to continually reheapify, the complexity can be approximated based on the number of operations and array elements, leading roughly to \(O(k \log n)\) where \(k\) is a derived factor based on the number of operations and heap size dynamics.
