[Leetcode 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l930)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to `goal`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are [1,0,1], [1,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,1].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the elements in the `nums` array strictly binary (0 or 1)?
   - Yes.
2. Can the `goal` be a negative number?
   - No, since the array is binary and thus non-negative sums only.
3. What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and the value of `goal`?
   - The length of `nums` will be between `1` and `30000`, and `goal` will be between `0` and the length of `nums`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a prefix sum along with a hash map to keep track of the frequencies of prefix sums we encounter. By doing this, we can count the number of subarrays that sum up to `goal` in linear time.

### Steps:
1. Use a variable `sum` to maintain the current prefix sum while iterating through the array.
2. Use a hash map `prefixSumCount` to store frequencies of various prefix sums encountered.
3. For every element in the array:
   - Update the current prefix sum.
   - Check if `sum - goal` exists in the hash map. If it does, it means we found subarrays ending at the current index which sum up to `goal`.
   - Update the hash map with the current prefix sum.

This approach ensures we only pass through the array once, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} goal
 * @return {number}
 */
var numSubarraysWithSum = function(nums, goal) {
    let prefixSumCount = new Map();
    prefixSumCount.set(0, 1); // To handle the case when a subarray with sum equal to goal starts from index 0
    let sum = 0;
    let result = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        sum += num;
        
        if (prefixSumCount.has(sum - goal)) {
            result += prefixSumCount.get(sum - goal);
        }
        
        prefixSumCount.set(sum, (prefixSumCount.get(sum) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`. We iterate through the array once, and all operations (map insertion and lookup) are O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case scenario where all prefix sums are unique.

This ensures the solution is efficient and scalable for large input sizes.
