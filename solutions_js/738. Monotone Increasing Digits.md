[Leetcode 738. Monotone Increasing Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l738)
### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `N`, find the largest number that is less than or equal to `N` with monotone increasing digits.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: N = 10
Output: 9
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: N = 1234
Output: 1234
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: N = 332
Output: 299
```

**Note:**
- `N` is an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of "monotone increasing digits"?**
   - A number has monotone increasing digits if each digit is less than or equal to the next digit.
   
2. **What should be returned if the input number itself has monotone increasing digits?**
   - If `N` itself has monotone increasing digits, return `N`.

3. **Are there any leading zeros in input or output?**
   - No, the numbers are standard integers without leading zeros.

### Strategy
1. Convert the number into an array of its digits.
2. Identify the first place from the left where the digits stop being monotone increasing.
3. Decrease the digit at this problematic place and set all following digits to 9 to ensure the number remains maximum and all digits after it contribute to making it a valid decreasing sequence.
4. After making the change, recheck from the start to ensure the number is still monotone increasing. If not, repeat the decrease process.

### Code
```javascript
function monotoneIncreasingDigits(N) {
    let digits = Array.from(String(N), Number);
    let n = digits.length;
    let marker = n;
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if (digits[i] < digits[i - 1]) {
            marker = i;
            digits[i - 1]--;
        }
    }

    for (let i = marker; i < n; i++) {
        digits[i] = 9;
    }

    return parseInt(digits.join(''), 10);
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(d)`, where `d` is the number of digits in `N`. This is because we make a single pass to find the problematic digit where the non-monotone condition starts and another pass to set the subsequent digits to `9`.

### Explanation
1. Convert the integer `N` to an array of its digits for easier manipulation.
2. Traverse from the end of the array to the start. When a non-increasing pair is found, mark its position and decrease the preceding digit.
3. Set all digits following the marked position to `9` to form the largest possible number that maintains the monotone increasing property.
4. Convert the modified array of digits back to an integer and return it.
