[Leetcode 2106. Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2106)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D list `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [position_i, amount_i]` represents `amount_i` fruits located at `position_i` on a horizontal line. You start at position `startPos`. 

Your task is to return the maximum number of fruits you can collect in at most `k` steps. You can go left or right from your starting position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the `fruits` array sorted by position?**
   - No, it can be in any order.

2. **Can positions and amounts be negative or zero?**
   - Positions are non-negative integers. Amounts are non-negative integers.

3. **Is it feasible to have duplicate positions in the `fruits` array?**
   - No, each position is unique.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input?**
   - The number of fruit positions and the value of `k` can be quite large, potentially up to 10^5.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the positions**: First, we need to sort the `fruits` array by position.
2. **Define boundaries**:
   - You will need to determine the boundary positions (leftmost and rightmost) that you can reach within `k` steps.
3. **Sliding Window**:
   - We can use a sliding window approach to find the maximum fruits we can collect, considering the distance constraints from `startPos`.

### Code

```javascript
function maxFruits(fruits, startPos, k) {
    // Step 1: Sort fruits by position
    fruits.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Step 2: Use a prefix sum array to get the sum of fruits between any two positions
    let n = fruits.length;
    let prefix = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + fruits[i][1];
    }

    // Binary search helper to find the farthest position within a limit
    function binarySearch(low, high, limit, getPos) {
        while (low < high) {
            let mid = Math.floor((low + high + 1) / 2);
            if (getPos(mid) <= limit) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    let maxFruitsCollected = 0;

    // Case 1: Walk to the left then to the right
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let dist = startPos - fruits[i][0];
        if (dist > k) break; // too far to the left
        let maxRightPos = startPos + (k - 2 * dist);
        let rightIdx = binarySearch(i, n - 1, maxRightPos, (idx) => fruits[idx][0]);
        maxFruitsCollected = Math.max(maxFruitsCollected, prefix[rightIdx + 1] - prefix[i]);
    }

    // Case 2: Walk to the right then to the left
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let dist = fruits[i][0] - startPos;
        if (dist > k) break; // too far to the right
        let maxLeftPos = startPos - (k - 2 * dist);
        let leftIdx = binarySearch(0, i, maxLeftPos, (idx) => fruits[idx][0]);
        maxFruitsCollected = Math.max(maxFruitsCollected, prefix[i + 1] - prefix[leftIdx]);
    }

    return maxFruitsCollected;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step**: O(n log n) where n is the number of fruit positions.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n).
- **Sliding Window and Binary Search**: Each produces O(n log n) complexity in the worst case due to the binary search within the loop.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n log n).

This solution should efficiently handle the input constraints, ensuring that the operations remain within feasible limits even for large values of `n`.
