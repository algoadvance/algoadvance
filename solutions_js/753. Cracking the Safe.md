[Leetcode 753. Cracking the Safe](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l753)
Sure! Let's start with the problem statement, and then we can break it down step by step.

## Problem Statement

**LeetCode 753: Cracking the Safe**

There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of digits, and the safe has a circular dial with 10 positions numbered 0 through 9.

The password is supposed to be the shortest string of digits that includes all possible `k`-digit combinations of the digits from 0 to 9 as a substring. You need to find the password and return it.

**Example:**
```
Input: k = 1
Output: "0123456789"

Input: k = 2
Output: "001122334455667788990"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that `k` will be a valid integer and within a certain range?**
   - Yes, k will be a positive integer and within reasonable limits for calculation.
   
2. **Can I assume that we need to find the shortest possible password?**
   - Yes, the problem explicitly asks for the shortest string that includes all possible k-digit combinations.

3. **Is the output format any specific string format, or just any possible string that fits the criteria?**
   - Any valid shortest string that fits the criteria is acceptable.

## Strategy

To construct the shortest sequence containing every possible `k`-digit combination, we will use a method rooted in graph theory called the **de Bruijn sequence**. This sequence is the shortest cyclic sequence that contains each possible k-length string exactly once.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Generate Nodes and Edges:**
   - We generate a directed graph where nodes represent each possible (k-1)-length combination (prefix) and edges represent each possible k-length combination (suffix).
   
2. **Hierholzer's Algorithm:**
   - Use Hierholzer's algorithm to find an Eulerian circuit in this directed graph, ensuring each edge is visited exactly once.

3. **Construct the Sequence:**
   - From the Eulerian circuit, construct the sequence while ensuring that each k-length combination is considered exactly once.

### Code

Here, we implement the above steps directly in JavaScript.

```javascript
function crackSafe(k, n) {
    if (k === 1) {
        return Array.from({length: n}, (_, i) => i).join('');
    }
    
    const numNodes = Math.pow(n, k - 1);
    const result = [];
    const seen = new Set();

    const dfs = (node) => {
        for (let x = 0; x < n; x++) {
            const nextNode = node * n + x;
            if (!seen.has(nextNode)) {
                seen.add(nextNode);
                dfs(nextNode % numNodes);
                result.push(x);
            }
        }
    };

    dfs(0);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < k; i++) {
        result.push(0);
    }
    
    return result.reverse().join('');
}

console.log(crackSafe(1, 10)); // "0123456789"
console.log(crackSafe(2, 10)); // The exact output may vary, but should be a shortest string containing all 2-digit combinations
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

- Generating nodes and edges: O(n^k) - Generating the numbers and every possible combination requires O(n^k) operations.
- Depth-first search traversal: O(n^k) - Since we are traversing every edge exactly once.
- Constructing the final output also happens in linear time to the length of the string.

Hence, the overall complexity is O(n^k).
