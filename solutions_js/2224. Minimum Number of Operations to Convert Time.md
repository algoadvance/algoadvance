[Leetcode 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2224)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `current` and `correct`, representing two 24-hour times in the format "HH:MM", return the minimum number of operations required to convert `current` to `correct`.

You can perform the following operations:

- Add 1 minute
- Add 15 minutes
- Add 30 minutes
- Add 60 minutes

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range:** Are the input times always valid 24-hour times?
   - Yes, both `current` and `correct` are valid times in "HH:MM" format.
2. **Edge Cases:** Do we need to handle any specific edge cases, such as times spanning across midnight?
   - The problem does not specifically mention crossing midnight, but since time is formatted in "HH:MM", we assume both `current` and `correct` are in the same day.

## Strategy
1. Convert both times from "HH:MM" format to the total number of minutes since 00:00.
2. Calculate the difference in minutes between `current` and `correct`.
3. Use a greedy approach to minimize the number of operations:
   - Prioritize subtracting larger minute chunks first (60, 30, 15, 1).
4. Subtract the largest possible value until the difference is 0.
5. Return the total number of operations.

## Example
- `current = "02:30"`
- `correct = "04:35"`

The difference in minutes is `125` (275 minutes - 150 minutes), and the minimum number of operations are calculated by taking the largest possible chunks.

## Code
```javascript
function convertTime(current, correct) {
    function toMinutes(time) {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }

    const currentMinutes = toMinutes(current);
    const correctMinutes = toMinutes(correct);
    
    let difference = correctMinutes - currentMinutes;
    let operations = 0;

    const timeIncrements = [60, 30, 15, 1];
    
    for (const increment of timeIncrements) {
        if (difference >= increment) {
            operations += Math.floor(difference / increment);
            difference %= increment;
        }
    }

    return operations;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(convertTime("02:30", "04:35")); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- **Converting Time:** The conversion of both times to minutes is O(1) since the operations on strings and simple arithmetic are constant.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** The loop over the fixed increment list is O(1) since it always iterates over four elements (60, 30, 15, 1).
- **Overall:** The time complexity of the solution is O(1).

This constant time complexity ensures the solution is highly efficient and handles the conversion with minimal computation regardless of input size.
