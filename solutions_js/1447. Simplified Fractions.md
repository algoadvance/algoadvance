[Leetcode 1447. Simplified Fractions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1447)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, you need to return a list of strings representing all simplified fractions between `0` and `1` (exclusive) such that the denominators are less than or equal to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is considered a simplified fraction?**
   A fraction is considered simplified if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator is `1`.
   
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   The typical constraint will be `1 <= n <= 100`.

3. **What should be included in the list?**
   Only those fractions in their simplest form between `0` and `1` exclusive.

### Code
```javascript
function simplifiedFractions(n) {
    const result = [];

    for (let denominator = 2; denominator <= n; denominator++) {
        for (let numerator = 1; numerator < denominator; numerator++) {
            if (gcd(numerator, denominator) === 1) {
                result.push(`${numerator}/${denominator}`);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

function gcd(a, b) {
    return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(simplifiedFractions(2));  // Output: ["1/2"]
console.log(simplifiedFractions(3));  // Output: ["1/2", "1/3", "2/3"]
console.log(simplifiedFractions(4));  // Output: ["1/2", "1/3", "2/3", "1/4", "3/4"]
console.log(simplifiedFractions(1));  // Output: []
```

### Strategy
1. **Loop Through Denominators:**
   Start with a loop that iterates through all possible denominators from `2` to `n`.

2. **Loop Through Numerators:**
   Within that loop, iterate through all possible numerators from `1` to one less than the current denominator.

3. **Check for Simplified Fractions:**
   For each numerator and denominator pair, check if the GCD of the two is `1`. If it is, then this fraction is in its simplest form and should be added to the result list.

4. **Implement the GCD Function:**
   Use the Euclidean algorithm to determine the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`. If the GCD is `1`, the numbers are co-prime.

### Time Complexity
- **Calculating GCD:** The time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers is O(log(min(a,b))).
- **Nested Loop Execution:** The number of iterations of the nested loop is proportional to `O(n^2)` in the worst case since we have to compare each numerator with each denominator under the given conditions.

Hence, the overall time complexity of this approach is **O(n^2 log n)**. This complexity should generally be acceptable given the constraints (`1 <= n <= 100`).

Feel free to ask if you have any specific cases or additional requirements!
