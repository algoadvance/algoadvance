[Leetcode 467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l467)
### Problem Statement

Consider the string `s` to be an infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Suppose we need to find the number of unique non-empty substrings of `s` that can be present in any given `p`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string `p` guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input string `p` contains only lowercase English letters.

2. **Does the infinite wraparound string imply cyclic access like from 'z' back to 'a'?**
   - Yes, from 'z' you wrap back around to 'a'.

3. **Should substrings be consecutive in `p`?**
   - Yes, substrings must be consecutive which mirror segments of the infinite wraparound string.

### Strategy

The problem is to count unique substrings that can form parts of the infinite string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". 

The key insight is to leverage each character in `p` and count the maximum length of consecutive substrings ending in each character. If we know this for each letter, we can sum these lengths to get the count of distinct substrings.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `count[]` of size 26 to store the maximum length of substrings ending with each letter of the alphabet.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Iterate through `p` to update the count array based on substring continuation and the cyclic nature.

3. **Check for Continuity:**
   - For each character, check if it follows the previous character in the infinite wraparound string.

4. **Summing the Results:**
   - Sum all values in the `count[]` array to get the number of unique substrings.

### Code

```javascript
var findSubstringInWraproundString = function(p) {
    let count = new Array(26).fill(0);
    let maxLengthCur = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
        let currentChar = p.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        
        if (i > 0 && 
           (p.charCodeAt(i - 1) === p.charCodeAt(i) - 1 || 
            (p.charCodeAt(i - 1) === 'z'.charCodeAt(0) && p.charCodeAt(i) === 'a'.charCodeAt(0)))) {
            maxLengthCur++;
        } else {
            maxLengthCur = 1;
        }
        
        count[currentChar] = Math.max(count[currentChar], maxLengthCur);
    }

    return count.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val);
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `p`. This is because we are iterating through the string once.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization:** We initialize `count` array of size 26 with zeros to store the max length of substrings ending with 'a', 'b', ..., 'z'.
2. **Loop through Characters:** For each character `p[i]`:
   - Compute `currentChar` which is the zero-based index of the character ('a' → 0, ..., 'z' → 25).
   - If it forms a contiguous substring with the previous character (`p[i-1]`), increment `maxLengthCur`.
   - Else, reset `maxLengthCur` to 1.
   - Update the count array at `currentChar` position with the maximum length of the substring ending with that character.
3. **Return Result:** Finally, sum all values in the `count` array to get the total count of unique substrings.
