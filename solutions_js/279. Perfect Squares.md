[Leetcode 279. Perfect Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l279)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on `n`?
   - Typically, constraints specify the range for `n`.
2. **Edge Cases**: How should we handle cases where `n` is very small or specific numbers such as 0?
   - For example, `n = 1` should return 1 because 1 is a perfect square.
3. **Output Format**: Should the output be a specific data type?
   - Generally, it should be an integer indicating the fewest number of perfect squares.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to build a solution for each number from `1` to `n` and use previously computed results to solve the current number. We will use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the least number of perfect squares that sum to `i`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n + 1` with all values set to `Infinity`, except `dp[0]` which should be `0`.
2. Iterate over each number from `1` to `n`.
3. For each number, iterate over all perfect squares less than or equal to the current number.
4. Update the `dp` array by considering the minimum value between the current `dp[i]` and `dp[i - square] + 1`.
5. The result will be stored in `dp[n]`.

### Pseudocode:
1. Initialize `dp` array.
2. For each number `i` from `1` to `n`:
   - For each perfect square `j` such that `j * j <= i`:
     - Update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - j * j] + 1`.
3. Return `dp[n]`.

## Code
```javascript
function numSquares(n) {
    // Initialize the dp array with Infinity
    const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0; // Because 0 can be formed by 0 numbers
    
    // Loop over each number from 1 to n
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Check each perfect square less than or equal to the current number
        for (let j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \sqrt{n})\) where `n` is the input number. This is because we have an outer loop running `n` times and an inner loop running approximately `sqrt(n)` times.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the `dp` array used to store the results of subproblems.
