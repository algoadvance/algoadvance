[Leetcode 332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l332)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [from_i, to_i] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order using these tickets. 

All the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK". Thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

- You must use all the tickets once and only once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can any airport appear as both a departure and an arrival airport?
   - Yes.

2. Are all airport codes guaranteed to be unique and valid?
   - Assume they follow standard IATA 3-letter codes, but not necessarily unique in the context of departure vs arrival.

3. Can there be multiple valid itineraries?
   - Yes, but you are required to return the lexicographically smallest one.

## Strategy

The problem can be visualized as finding an Eulerian path in a directed graph, where each airport is a node and each ticket is a directed edge. We start from "JFK" and ensure we visit all the nodes, considering the lexicographical order of nodes.

We'll use Hierholzer's algorithm for finding the Eulerian path in this directed graph. The general steps are:

1. **Build the graph**: Use an adjacency list where each key is a node and the value is a sorted list of destination nodes. Ensure sorting for lexical order.
2. **DFS to find the itinerary**: Start from "JFK", and recursively visit nodes using depth-first search. Append nodes to result in reverse order to build the final itinerary.

## Code

```javascript
function findItinerary(tickets) {
    // Build the graph
    let graph = {};
    for (let [from, to] of tickets) {
        if (!graph[from]) graph[from] = [];
        graph[from].push(to);
    }
    
    // Sort the destinations lexicographically
    for (let from in graph) {
        graph[from].sort();
    }

    let result = [];
    
    function dfs(curr) {
        let dests = graph[curr] || [];
        while (dests.length) {
            dfs(dests.shift()); // Remove the first element and explore it
        }
        result.push(curr);
    }
    
    dfs("JFK");
    
    return result.reverse();
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findItinerary([["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]));
console.log(findItinerary([["JFK", "SFO"], ["JFK", "ATL"], ["SFO", "ATL"], ["ATL", "JFK"], ["ATL", "SFO"]]));
```

## Time Complexity

Building the graph involves going through each ticket once, so it's O(N), where N is the number of tickets. Sorting each adjacency list means O(E log E) where E is the number of edges. Finally, the DFS operation will visit each edge exactly once, which is O(E). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(E log E), primarily due to sorting the adjacency lists.
