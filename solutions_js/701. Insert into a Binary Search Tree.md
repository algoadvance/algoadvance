[Leetcode 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l701)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) and a `value` to insert into the tree. Insert the `value` into the BST such that the BST properties are maintained, and return the root node of the BST.

A BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The function signature is as follows:
```javascript
function insertIntoBST(root, val) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if the tree is initially empty (i.e., `root` is `null`)?
   **A:** If the tree is initially empty, you should create a new tree with the given value as the root node and return that node.

2. **Q:** Can the inserted value already exist in the tree?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that the value to be inserted will not exist in the BST.

3. **Q:** Should the function handle large trees efficiently?
   **A:** Yes, since a BST insertion should ideally have a time complexity of O(log(n)) in average conditions.

### Code

Here is a JavaScript function to insert a value into a BST:

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

function insertIntoBST(root, val) {
    // Handle the case when the tree is empty
    if (root === null) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }
    
    // Initialize current node to root
    let currentNode = root;
    
    while (true) {
        // If the value to be inserted is less than the current node's value, go to the left subtree
        if (val < currentNode.val) {
            // If there's no left child, insert here
            if (currentNode.left === null) {
                currentNode.left = new TreeNode(val);
                break;
            } else {
                // Move to the left child
                currentNode = currentNode.left;
            }
        } else {
            // If the value to be inserted is greater than the current node's value, go to the right subtree
            if (currentNode.right === null) {
                currentNode.right = new TreeNode(val);
                break;
            } else {
                // Move to the right child
                currentNode = currentNode.right;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return root;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Edge Case Check:** First, check if the tree is empty. If `root` is `null`, create a new node with the given value and return it.
2. **Iterate for Position:** Use a loop to traverse the tree starting from the `root`.
3. **Left or Right Move:** Depending on the comparison between the current node's value and the value to be inserted, move left or right:
   - If the value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child.
   - If the value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right child.
4. **Insert Node:** When a suitable `null` position is found (either left or right of the current node), insert the new node at that position and break out of the loop.
5. **Return Root:** Finally, return the root of the modified tree.

### Time Complexity

The average time complexity of the insert operation in a BST is **O(log(n))** where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, on average, the tree would be balanced, giving a logarithmic height.

In the worst-case scenario (e.g., the tree becomes a linked list like structure), the time complexity would degrade to **O(n)**.
