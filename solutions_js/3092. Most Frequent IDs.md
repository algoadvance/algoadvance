[Leetcode 3092. Most Frequent IDs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3092)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of customer IDs, return the most frequent customer ID in the array. If there is a tie for the most frequent ID, return the smallest ID among them.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What data type will the customer IDs be? 
   - They will be integers.
   
2. What should be returned in case of an empty array?
   - We can assume the array will not be empty as per the problem description.

3. What is the range of the customer IDs?
   - The problem does not specify, so we may assume they are within the JavaScript safe integer range.

## Strategy

1. Use a hash map to count the frequency of each customer ID.
2. Traverse the hash map to determine the customer ID with the highest frequency.
3. In case of a tie, return the smallest customer ID.

## Code

```javascript
function mostFrequentID(ids) {
    const frequencyMap = new Map();

    // Build frequency map
    for (const id of ids) {
        if (frequencyMap.has(id)) {
            frequencyMap.set(id, frequencyMap.get(id) + 1);
        } else {
            frequencyMap.set(id, 1);
        }
    }

    let mostFrequentId = null;
    let highestFrequency = 0;

    // Determine the most frequent ID
    for (const [id, frequency] of frequencyMap.entries()) {
        if (frequency > highestFrequency || (frequency === highestFrequency && id < mostFrequentId)) {
            highestFrequency = frequency;
            mostFrequentId = id;
        }
    }

    return mostFrequentId;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(mostFrequentID([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the Frequency Map:** O(n), where n is the number of customer IDs.
2. **Traversing the Map to Determine the Most Frequent ID:** O(m), where m is the number of unique customer IDs.

**Total Time Complexity:** O(n), because in the worst case, the number of unique customer IDs `m` is proportional to `n`.
