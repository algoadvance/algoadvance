[Leetcode 1528. Shuffle String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1528)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length, the string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i`-th position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input values:**
   - What is the length range for string `s` and array `indices`?
   - Answer: The length `n` can be up to 100.

2. **Character set:**
   - Are there any constraints on the characters in the string `s`?
   - Answer: No, `s` can contain any lowercase English letters.

3. **Uniqueness of indices:**
   - Are the values in `indices` guaranteed to be unique and in the range `[0, n-1]`?
   - Answer: Yes, every value in `indices` will be unique and within the valid range.

4. **Matching lengths:**
   - Can we assume that the lengths of `s` and `indices` are always the same?
   - Answer: Yes, `s` and `indices` will always have the same length.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can proceed with the following steps:

1. Create an empty array `result` of the same length as the input string `s`.
2. Iterate through the string `s` and the `indices` array simultaneously.
3. For each character in `s` and its corresponding index in `indices`, place the character in the corresponding position in the `result` array.
4. Convert the `result` array back to a string and return it.

### Code

```javascript
var restoreString = function(s, indices) {
    const result = new Array(s.length); 
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        result[indices[i]] = s[i];
    }
    
    return result.join('');
};

// Example usage:
console.log(restoreString("codeleet", [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3])); // Output: "leetcode"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because:
- We iterate through the string `s` and the `indices` array exactly once.
- Assigning the character to the specific index in the `result` array is an O(1) operation.
- Joining the array to form the final string is also O(n).

Therefore, the entire process is linear in time with respect to the input size.
