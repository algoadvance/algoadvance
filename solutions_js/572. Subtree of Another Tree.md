[Leetcode 572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l572)
### Problem Statement
Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this nodeâ€™s descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Node Values**: Do the tree nodes contain unique values?
    - No, node values may be repeated.
2. **Tree Size**: What are the constraints on the size of the trees?
    - Number of nodes in the tree `root` is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
    - Number of nodes in the tree `subRoot` is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
3. **Tree Structure**: Are the trees binary trees?
    - Yes, both trees are binary trees.
4. **Nullable Nodes**: Can `root` or `subRoot` be `null`?
    - The problem guarantees that both `root` and `subRoot` are non-null.

### Strategy
1. **Tree Traversal and Comparison**:
   - We need a function `isSameTree` to check if two trees are identical.
   - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the main tree `root`. For each node in the main tree, use the `isSameTree` function to check if the subtree rooted at that node is identical to `subRoot`.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

var isSubtree = function(root, subRoot) {
    if (!root) return false;
    if (isSameTree(root, subRoot)) return true;
    return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
};

var isSameTree = function(s, t) {
    if (!s && !t) return true;
    if (!s || !t) return false;
    if (s.val !== t.val) return false;
    return isSameTree(s.left, t.left) && isSameTree(s.right, t.right);
};

// Example usage
// let root = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(4, new TreeNode(1), new TreeNode(2)), new TreeNode(5));
// let subRoot = new TreeNode(4, new TreeNode(1), new TreeNode(2));
// console.log(isSubtree(root, subRoot)); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity
- **isSubtree** function:
  - In the worst case, you might traverse all nodes in `root` for each starting point in `root`, leading to `O(m*n)` complexity where `m` is the number of nodes in `root` and `n` is the number of nodes in `subRoot`.
- **isSameTree** function:
  - Each call to `isSameTree` is `O(min(m, n))`.
- Hence, the worst-case combined time complexity is `O(m*n)`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is determined by the recursion depth, which in the worst case is `O(m)` due to the depth of the recursion stack (for skewed trees).

This approach checks every possible subtree of `root` to see if it matches `subRoot`, ensuring correctness while maintaining concise and clear code structure.
