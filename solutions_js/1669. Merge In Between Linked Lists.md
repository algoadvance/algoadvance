[Leetcode 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1669)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.

You are also given two integers `a` and `b` such that `0 <= a <= b < n`. 

The goal is to merge `list2` into `list1` such that `list2` replaces the sections of `list1` from the `a`-th node to the `b`-th node (inclusive). Specifically, the nodes from `a` to `b` in `list1` are completely removed, and `list2` is inserted in their place.

Return the head of the resulting linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002], a = 3, b = 4
Output: [0,1,2,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are the lists singly linked or doubly linked?
   - They are singly linked lists.
2. Can the lists be empty?
   - `list1` cannot be empty as `a` and `b` are indices within `list1`. `list2` can be empty, but `list1` will remain as is from `0` to `a-1` and `b+1` onwards.
3. Is it guaranteed that `list2` should be inserted exactly in place and no extra adjustments needed?
   - Yes, exactly replacing nodes from index `a` to `b` inclusive.

### Code:
```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
}

var mergeInBetween = function(list1, list2, a, b) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = list1;
    let current = dummy;
    
    // Step 1: Traverse list1 to just before node `a`
    for(let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // Keep a reference to the `a`-1 node in list1
    let nodeBeforeA = current;
    
    // Step 2: Traverse from `a` to `b` in list1
    for(let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    // Keep a reference to the `b+1` node in list1
    let nodeAfterB = current.next;
    
    // Step 3: Link `nodeBeforeA` to the head of `list2`
    nodeBeforeA.next = list2;
    
    // Step 4: Traverse through the entirety of `list2`
    let tail2 = list2;
    while(tail2.next !== null) {
        tail2 = tail2.next;
    }
    
    // Step 5: Link the end of `list2` to `nodeAfterB`
    tail2.next = nodeAfterB;
    
    return dummy.next;
};
```

### Strategy:
1. **Traverse `list1` to find the node just before the index `a`**.
2. **Continue traversing to find the node just after index `b`**.
3. **Link the node before `a` to the head of `list2`**.
4. **Traverse `list2` to find its tail**.
5. **Link the tail of `list2` to the node after `b`**.
6. **Return the modified `list1`**.

### Time Complexity:
- **Traversal of `list1`**: \(O(a + b - a + 1) = O(b + 1) \approx O(n)\)
- **Traversal of `list2`**: \(O(m)\)
- **Overall Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\)
