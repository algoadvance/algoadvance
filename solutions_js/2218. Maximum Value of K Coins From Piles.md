[Leetcode 2218. Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2218)
## Problem Statement

You are given `piles`, an array of `n` piles of coins, where each pile contains a non-negative integer number of coins. 

The coins in each pile are stored as a list of integers. You cannot break up piles. For example, if a pile contains [1,2,3] coins, you cannot select 2 coins from the pile; you have to select either all of them or none.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the total number of coins you can select across all piles.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the coins you pick given you can pick at most `k` coins.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can a pile contain zero coins?
2. Is it possible for the value of `k` to be larger than the total coins available?
3. Are the coins in the piles sorted in any specific order?

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll define `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum value we can get using the first `i` piles and `j` coins.
2. **Prefix Sums**: Use prefix sums to easily calculate the value of taking multiple coins from a pile.
3. **Transitions**: For each pile, for each possible `k` coins that can be picked, update the dp state by considering all possible decisions (taking 0, 1, ..., k coins from the current pile).

## Code

```javascript
var maxValueOfCoins = function(piles, k) {
    // Initialize DP table with (k+1) columns because we need to consider 0 to k coins.
    let dp = new Array(piles.length + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(k + 1).fill(0));

    // Iterate over each pile
    for (let i = 1; i <= piles.length; i++) {
        const pile = piles[i - 1];
        // Calculate the prefix sums for the current pile
        let prefixSums = [0];
        for (const coin of pile) {
            prefixSums.push(prefixSums[prefixSums.length - 1] + coin);
        }
        
        // Update dp table
        for (let coins = 0; coins <= k; coins++) {
            // Try to take 0 to min(coins, pile.length) coins from the current pile
            for (let x = 0; x <= Math.min(coins, pile.length); x++) {
                dp[i][coins] = Math.max(dp[i][coins], dp[i - 1][coins - x] + prefixSums[x]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[piles.length][k];
};
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **DP Initialization**: We initialize the DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value we can get using the first `i` piles and `j` coins.
2. **Prefix Sums**: For each pile, compute prefix sums up to that pile so that we can easily calculate the sum of any subset of coins we choose.
3. **DP Transition**: For each pile, for every count of coins we can take (from `0` to `k`), update the DP value considering taking `0` to `min(pile.length, j)` coins from the current pile and adding the value to the best possible value from the previous pile state.
4. **Final Result**: The result is stored in `dp[piles.length][k]`, representing the maximum value achievable with all piles and `k` coins.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k^2)` where `n` is the number of piles and `k` is the maximum number of coins. This arises because for each pile we may iterate up to `k` and for each element within `k`, we iterate up to another `k` coins.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)` due to the DP table's size.

This solution efficiently finds the optimal selection of coins using dynamic programming with regard to the number of piles and the maximum number of coins to be selected.
