[Leetcode 2405. Optimal Partition of String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2405)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal partition is ["a","b","a","cab","a"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ssssss"
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal partition is ["s","s","s","s","s","s"].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the substrings overlap?**
   - No, the substrings must be contiguous and non-overlapping.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the input string length?**
   - Constraints are typically provided. For this problem, assume `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
   
3. **Are there any constraints on the character set?**
   - The problem usually involves lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty set to keep track of characters in the current substring and a counter for the partitions.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse each character in the string.
   - If the character is already in the set, it's a signal to partition.
   - Add the character to the set if it's not present.
3. **Partition Logic**: Each time we encounter a duplicate character, increment the partition counter and clear the set for a new substring.
4. **Edge cases**: Handle single character and repetitive characters.

### Code

```javascript
var partitionString = function(s) {
    let charSet = new Set();
    let partitions = 0;
    
    for (let ch of s) {
        if (charSet.has(ch)) {
            partitions++;
            charSet.clear();
        }
        charSet.add(ch);
    }
    
    // Count the last partition if there's any characters left in the set.
    if (charSet.size > 0) {
        partitions++;
    }
    
    return partitions;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(partitionString("abacaba")); // Output: 4
console.log(partitionString("ssssss"));  // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We are iterating over the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** in terms of auxiliary space, as the set can hold at most 26 characters (all lowercase English letters).

This ensures the solution is efficient and handles the upper constraint of the input size effectively.
