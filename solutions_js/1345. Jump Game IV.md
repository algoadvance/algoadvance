[Leetcode 1345. Jump Game IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1345)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. You need to return the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What happens if `arr` has only one element?
   **A:** No jumps are needed, so the answer should be `0`.

2. **Q:** Can we assume that it's always possible to reach the last index?
   **A:** Yes, based on the problem statement constraints, we can assume that it's always possible.

3. **Q:** Are there negative values in `arr`?
   **A:** Yes, `arr` can contain negative values within the given range.

### Strategy
This problem can be approached by using Breadth-First Search (BFS) considering each element as a node. The BFS approach helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, making it ideal for our problem.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a queue to store the positions and the number of jumps needed to reach them.
   - Use a `visited` array to keep track of visited nodes.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Start from the first element (index `0`).
   - For each position, consider all possible jumps to the next indices within the allowed step range from the current element value.
   - Add valid steps to the queue and mark them as visited.
   - If we reach the last index, return the number of jumps.

### Code
```javascript
var minJumps = function(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    if (n === 1) return 0;
    
    let queue = [[0, 0]]; // [index, number of steps to reach this index]
    let visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    visited[0] = true;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [index, steps] = queue.shift();
        
        for (let step = 1; step <= arr[index]; step++) {
            let nextIndex = index + step;
            
            if (nextIndex >= n) break;
            
            if (!visited[nextIndex]) {
                if (nextIndex === n - 1) {
                    return steps + 1;
                }
                queue.push([nextIndex, steps + 1]);
                visited[nextIndex] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // It should never reach here as it's guaranteed to be able to reach the last index.
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
  - Every node (index) is processed at most once.
  - Each node checks its neighbors (steps), which will in total be less than or equal to `n`.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
  - Due to the `queue` and `visited` array.

This implementation ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.
