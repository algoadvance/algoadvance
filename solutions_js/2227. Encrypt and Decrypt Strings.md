[Leetcode 2227. Encrypt and Decrypt Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2227)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `key` and `message`, to help in encryption and decryption.

The `key` is a string of unique lowercase letters. This means it contains each lowercase letter exactly once in an arbitrary order.

The `message` is another string of lowercase letters that you want to either encrypt or decrypt.

The encryption should map each letter in the `message` to the corresponding letter found in the `key`. So, for example, if `key[0]` is 'b', and the first letter of the alphabet is 'a', then every 'a' in the `message` should be replaced with 'b'.

Similarly, decryption should work in the reverse fashion, mapping each letter in the `message` to its corresponding original letter in the alphabet.

Implement the `EncryptorDecryptor` class with the following methods:

1. `encrypt(message: string): string`
    - Encrypts the given `message` using the `key`.

2. `decrypt(encryptedMessage: string): string`
    - Decrypts the given `encryptedMessage` back to the original message using the `key`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the `key` guaranteed to contain all unique characters?
2. Should we consider only the given `key` for both encryption and decryption in one instance of the class?
3. Can the characters in the `message` be non-alphabetic or should we ignore non-alphabetic characters?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an instance of the `EncryptorDecryptor` class initialized with a key.
   - Create two mappings:
     - **Encryption map**: This will map each letter in the alphabet to the corresponding letter in the `key`.
     - **Decryption map**: This will map each letter in the `key` back to the corresponding letter in the alphabet.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Use the **encryption map** to transform each character in the `message` and return the encrypted string.

3. **Decryption**:
   - Use the **decryption map** to transform each character in the `encryptedMessage` and return the decrypted string.

## Code

```javascript
class EncryptorDecryptor {
    constructor(key) {
        this.key = key;
        this.encryptionMap = {};
        this.decryptionMap = {};
        
        // creating encryption and decryption maps
        const alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
        for (let i = 0; i < alphabet.length; i++) {
            this.encryptionMap[alphabet[i]] = key[i];
            this.decryptionMap[key[i]] = alphabet[i];
        }
    }

    encrypt(message) {
        let encryptedMessage = '';
        for (let char of message) {
            encryptedMessage += this.encryptionMap[char];
        }
        return encryptedMessage;
    }

    decrypt(encryptedMessage) {
        let decryptedMessage = '';
        for (let char of encryptedMessage) {
            decryptedMessage += this.decryptionMap[char];
        }
        return decryptedMessage;
    }
}

// Example usage:
const key = 'phqgiumeaylnofdxjkrcvstzwb';
const message = 'hello';
const encryptorDecryptor = new EncryptorDecryptor(key);
const encryptedMessage = encryptorDecryptor.encrypt(message);
console.log('Encrypted message:', encryptedMessage);
const decryptedMessage = encryptorDecryptor.decrypt(encryptedMessage);
console.log('Decrypted message:', decryptedMessage);
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the two mappings will take O(26) time as there are 26 letters in the alphabet.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Both operations iterate through the input strings. Given the length of the input strings is `n`, the time complexity for each of these operations is O(n).

Overall, the space complexity is O(26) for the encryption and decryption maps since each map will contain 26 entries.
