[Leetcode 792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l792)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. Each word can be a subsequence of `s`. Return the number of words in the array `words` that are a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints for the inputs?**
   - The string `s` and the array `words` have lengths up to 5000.
   - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
   - `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters as well.

2. **Is there any guarantee that words in `words` are unique?**
   - No, words in `words` might not be unique.

3. **Is there a maximum length for each word in `words`?**
   - Yes, each word in `words` has a maximum length of 50.

### Strategy

1. **Subsequence Checking**: We need a helper function that checks if a word is a subsequence of `s`.
2. **Efficient Search**: To speed up the lookup, we can use a map to store positions of each character in `s`.
3. **Multiple Search**: For each word in `words`, we check if it’s a subsequence using the helper function.

### Steps

1. **Preprocessing `s`**: Create a map where each key is a character and each value is a list of indices where the character appears in `s`.
2. **Binary Search**: For checking if a word is a subsequence, use binary search to find positions of characters in `s` that preserve the relative order.
3. **Count Matching Subsequences**: Iterate through each word and use the helper function to count the valid subsequences.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var numMatchingSubseq = function(s, words) {
    // Create a map to store positions of each character in string s
    const charMap = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (!charMap.has(s[i])) {
            charMap.set(s[i], []);
        }
        charMap.get(s[i]).push(i);
    }
    
    // Function to check if a word is a subsequence of s
    const isSubsequence = (word) => {
        let lastPosition = -1;
        
        for (let char of word) {
            if (!charMap.has(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            const indices = charMap.get(char);
            let left = 0, right = indices.length - 1;
            
            // Binary search for the smallest index greater than lastPosition
            while (left <= right) {
                const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
                if (indices[mid] > lastPosition) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            
            if (left === indices.length) {
                return false;
            }
            
            lastPosition = indices[left];
        }
        
        return true;
    };
    
    // Count how many words are subsequences of s
    let count = 0;
    for (let word of words) {
        if (isSubsequence(word)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing** the string `s` to create the map takes \( O(n) \) where `n` is the length of `s`.
- **Checking a word**: For each word in `words`:
  - Each character lookup and binary search takes \( O(\log m) \).
  - If the average length of `words[i]` is `l`, the checking takes \( O(l \log m) \).
- **Total Complexity**:
  - Let `k` be the number of words in the `words` array.
  - Therefore, the overall complexity is \( O(n + k \times l \log m) \).

Here, `m` is the maximum possible positions list length in `charMap` (which doesn’t exceed `n`), `k` is the length of the words list, `l` is the average word length, and `n` is the length of `s`.
