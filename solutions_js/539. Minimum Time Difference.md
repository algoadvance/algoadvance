[Leetcode 539. Minimum Time Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l539)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of 24-hour clock times (`HH:MM`), find the minimum difference in minutes between any two time points in the list.

### Example:
```
Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
1. `2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 * 10^4`
2. `timePoints[i]` is in the format "HH:MM".

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done in the case of duplicate time points?
   - Typically for duplicates, the minimum difference would be 0. Thus, if duplicates exist, the minimum difference will be 0.
2. Are the time points guaranteed to be valid 24-hour times?
   - Yes, you can assume all `timePoints[i]` are valid 24-hour times.
3. Can I assume the input array is always non-empty?
   - Yes, the constraints already guarantee at least 2 time points.

## Strategy
1. **Convert Time Strings to Minutes**:
    - Convert each time in `timePoints` from the "HH:MM" format to the number of minutes past midnight.
   
2. **Sort the Time Points**:
    - Sort the time points. This step will help in easily calculating differences between consecutive times.
   
3. **Calculate Minimum Difference**:
    - Compute the differences between consecutive sorted times.
    - Also consider the difference between the first and last time across midnight (circular).
   
4. **Return Minimum Difference**:
    - Return the minimum difference found.

### Code Implementation:

```javascript
function findMinDifference(timePoints) {
    // Helper function to convert "HH:MM" to minutes from 00:00.
    const convertToMinutes = (time) => {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    // Convert all time points to minutes.
    const minutes = timePoints.map(convertToMinutes);

    // Sort the minutes array.
    minutes.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Find the minimum difference.
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    const n = minutes.length;

    // Compute the minimal difference between consecutive times.
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1]);
    }

    // Compute the difference between the first and the last time across midnight.
    const diffAcrossMidnight = 1440 + minutes[0] - minutes[n - 1];
    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, diffAcrossMidnight);

    return minDiff;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findMinDifference(["23:59","00:00"])); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Conversion to Minutes**: O(N), where N is the length of `timePoints`.
- **Sorting**: O(N log N).
- **Finding Minimum Difference**: O(N).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N log N)** due to the sorting step.

The space complexity is O(N) for storing the minutes array.
