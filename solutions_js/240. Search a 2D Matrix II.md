[Leetcode 240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l240)
### Problem Statement
Write an efficient algorithm to search for a target value in an `m x n` integer matrix. The matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Given a matrix:
```
matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
  [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
  [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
```
and a target value `target = 5`, return `true`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the function return `false` if the target is not found in the matrix?
   - Yes, return `false` if the target is not found.
2. What constraints can be imposed on the size of the matrix?
   - The matrix dimensions can be reasonably large, so the solution should be efficient.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can take advantage of the matrix properties (sorted rows and columns). 

#### Approach:
1. Start from the top-right corner of the matrix.
2. Use the following rules to traverse the matrix:
   - If the current value is equal to the target, return `true`.
   - If the current value is greater than the target, move left (decrease the column index).
   - If the current value is less than the target, move down (increase the row index).
3. Continue this process until the indices are out of the matrix's bounds.
4. If no match is found, return `false`.

### Code
```javascript
function searchMatrix(matrix, target) {
    if (!matrix || matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
        return false;
    }

    let rows = matrix.length;
    let cols = matrix[0].length;

    let row = 0;
    let col = cols - 1;

    while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
        if (matrix[row][col] === target) {
            return true;
        } else if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
            col--;
        } else {
            row++;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

// Example Usage:
// const matrix = [
//     [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
//     [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
//     [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
//     [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
//     [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
// ];
// const target = 5;
// console.log(searchMatrix(matrix, target)); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is \( O(m + n) \), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because, in the worst case, we might traverse `m` rows and `n` columns.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is \( O(1) \) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
