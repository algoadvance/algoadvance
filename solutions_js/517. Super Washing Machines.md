[Leetcode 517. Super Washing Machines](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l517)
## Problem Statement

You have `n` super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty.

For each move, you can choose any m (1 ≤ m ≤ n) washing machines, and pass one dress of each washing machine to one of its adjacent washing machines at the same time. If the number of dresses in the i-th machine is `machines[i]`, for each move, `machines[i-1]` gains 1 dress and `machines[i+1]` gains 1 dress from `machines[i]`.

Return the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it's not possible to do it, return -1.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: machines = [1,0,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st move:    1     0 <-- 5    =>    1     1     4
2nd move:    1 <-- 1 <-- 4    =>    2     2     3
3rd move:    2     2 <-- 3    =>    2     3     2

Input: machines = [0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
1st move:    0 <-- 3     0    =>    1     2     0
2nd move:    1     2 --> 0    =>    1     1     1

Input: machines = [0,2,0]
Output: -1
Explanation:
It's impossible to make all the three washing machines have the same number of dresses.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `n` (the number of washing machines)?
2. Is there a limit to the number of dresses in each washing machine?
3. Should the function handle edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with only one machine gracefully?

## Strategy
1. **Check Total Dresses**: First, determine if balancing the dresses is possible by checking if the total number of dresses is divisible by the number of machines.
2. **Calculate Target**: If balancing is possible, calculate the target number of dresses each machine should have.
3. **Track Moves**: Iterate through the array while tracking the number of dresses each machine needs to give or receive to achieve the target. The key is to find the maximum number of operations required for balance, which could involve either distribution from machines with surplus dresses or accumulation in machines with a deficit.

## Code

```javascript
function findMinMoves(machines) {
    const n = machines.length;
    const totalDresses = machines.reduce((sum, dresses) => sum + dresses, 0);
    
    // If the total number of dresses is not divisible by the number of machines, it's impossible
    if (totalDresses % n !== 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    const target = totalDresses / n;
    let maxMoves = 0;
    let currentBalance = 0;
    
    for (let dresses of machines) {
        const difference = dresses - target;
        currentBalance += difference;
        maxMoves = Math.max(maxMoves, Math.abs(currentBalance), difference);
    }

    return maxMoves;
}

// Sample Tests
console.log(findMinMoves([1, 0, 5])); // Output: 3
console.log(findMinMoves([0, 3, 0])); // Output: 2
console.log(findMinMoves([0, 2, 0])); // Output: -1
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of washing machines. This is because we perform a single pass through the `machines` array to both calculate the total number of dresses and then to determine the number of moves required.
