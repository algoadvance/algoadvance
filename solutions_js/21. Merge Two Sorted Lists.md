[Leetcode 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l21)
### Problem Statement

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a single sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the input lists?**
   - The input lists are singly linked lists.

2. **What should be returned if one or both of the input lists are null?**
   - If both lists are null, return null.
   - If one list is null, return the other list.

3. **Should the new linked list be created by creating new nodes or by reusing existing nodes?**
   - Reuse the existing nodes from `list1` and `list2`.

4. **How should we handle duplicate values?**
   - Since the lists are already sorted, simply merge them without removing duplicates.

5. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   - The goal is to achieve linear time complexity, O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `list1` and `list2` respectively.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a dummy node to act as the start of the merged linked list.
2. Use a pointer `current` to keep track of the last node in the merged list as we iterate.
3. Compare the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`. Append the smaller node to the merged list and move the respective pointer to the next node.
4. Continue this process until one of the lists is exhausted.
5. Append the remaining nodes from the non-exhausted list to the merged list.
6. Return the merged list starting from the node next to the dummy node.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `list1` and `list2` respectively. This is because each node is processed exactly once.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function mergeTwoLists(list1, list2) {
    // Initialize a dummy node to be the start of the merged list
    let dummy = new ListNode();
    // Current points to the last node in the merged list
    let current = dummy;

    // Iterate while both lists have nodes
    while (list1 !== null && list2 !== null) {
        if (list1.val <= list2.val) {
            current.next = list1;
            list1 = list1.next;
        } else {
            current.next = list2;
            list2 = list2.next;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Append the rest of the nodes in list1 if list2 is exhausted
    if (list1 !== null) {
        current.next = list1;
    }

    // Append the rest of the nodes in list2 if list1 is exhausted
    if (list2 !== null) {
        current.next = list2;
    }

    // Return the head of the merged list
    return dummy.next;
}
```

This code effectively merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list by iterating through both lists only once, ensuring efficient linear time complexity.
