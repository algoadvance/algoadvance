[Leetcode 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3223)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operations on the string any number of times:

1. Choose a **non-empty** substring `w` of `s`, where all characters of `w` are the same, and remove all occurrences of `w` from `s`.

Return the **minimum length** that `s` can be reduced to after performing any number of operations.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aabcccbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
Remove 'aa': Remaining string is "bcccbb".
Remove 'ccc': Remaining string is "bb".
Remove 'bb': Remaining string is "b".
Remove 'b': The minimum length of the string is 1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
No sequence of operations can reduce the string to a shorter length.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `s` be an empty string?
    - No, according to the problem description, `s` is a non-empty string.

2. Is there any constraint on the length of `s`?
    - Let's assume the usual competitive programming constraint (e.g., length up to 10^5).

3. Are there any characters other than lowercase English letters?
    - No, the string contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to track the characters as we iterate through the string. The idea is to use a stack to manage the removal of consecutive identical characters efficiently.

### Steps
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. If the stack is not empty and the top character of the stack is the same as the current character:
   - Remove (pop) the top character from the stack.
4. Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
5. The length of the stack at the end will be the minimum length of the string after all operations.

This approach leverages the stack data structure to manage character sequences effectively and ensures that we only iterate over the string once.

## Code

```javascript
function minLengthAfterOperations(s) {
    // Initialize an empty stack
    let stack = [];
    
    // Iterate over each character in the string
    for (let char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === char) {
            // Pop the top character if it matches the current character
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            // Push the current character onto the stack
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    
    // The length of the stack is the minimum length of the string
    return stack.length;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minLengthAfterOperations("aabcccbb")); // Output: 2
console.log(minLengthAfterOperations("abc"));      // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the string. This is because we perform a constant amount of work (push or pop) for each character in the input string.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case, which occurs when no characters are removed and all characters are pushed onto the stack.

This solution is efficient and effectively leverages the stack data structure to achieve the desired result.
