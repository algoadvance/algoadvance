### Problem Statement

**1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences**

Given a string `s`, determine if all the characters in the string have the same frequency. Return `true` if all characters have the same number of occurrences, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of string length?**
   - The string length could be from 1 up to \(10^5\).

2. **What type of characters does the string contain?**
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Can the string be empty?**
   - No, as per the problem, the string will have at least one character.

4. **Can I use built-in JavaScript methods like `Map` to keep track of occurrences?**
   - Yes, you can use any built-in JavaScript methods to solve the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency of Each Character:**
   - Use a `Map` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

2. **Store Frequency Counts in a Set:**
   - A `Set` will help us track unique frequencies of characters.

3. **Validation:**
   - If the `Set` size is 1 after processing the entire string, it means all characters have the same frequency.

4. **Edge Case:**
   - If there's only one unique character in the string, then it automatically satisfies the condition.

### Code

```javascript
function areOccurrencesEqual(s) {
    // Step 1: Create a Map to track frequency of each character
    const charCount = new Map();
    
    // Step 2: Populate the Map with character counts
    for (const char of s) {
        if (charCount.has(char)) {
            charCount.set(char, charCount.get(char) + 1);
        } else {
            charCount.set(char, 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Store frequencies in a Set to check uniqueness
    const frequencySet = new Set(charCount.values());
    
    // Step 4: Check if all characters have the same frequency
    return frequencySet.size === 1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(areOccurrencesEqual("abacbc")); // true
console.log(areOccurrencesEqual("aaabb"));  // false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We traverse the entire string to count frequencies which takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
  - Adding items to the `Set` is `O(1)` on average for each element, thus remains `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - The space complexity is constant, `O(1)`, as the maximum number of unique lowercase English letters is `26`.

This solution efficiently checks if all characters in the string appear an equal number of times.
