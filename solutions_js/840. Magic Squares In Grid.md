[Leetcode 840. Magic Squares In Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l840)
## Problem Statement

A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum. Given an `grid` of `m x n` integers, write a function to find and count all the 3 x 3 magic square subgrids in the given `grid`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the dimensions of the `grid`?
     - `m` and `n` are both >= 3.
   - What are the values in the grid?
     - Values are integers.

2. **Output:**
   - Return a single integer representing the number of 3 x 3 magic square subgrids.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The grid has the minimum dimension of 3 x 3.
   - Multiple overlapping magic squares.

## Strategy

1. **Magic Square Identification:** 
   - Sum of all numbers in a 3x3 magic square is \( 45 \) (since \(1 + 2 + \ldots + 9 = 45 \))
   - Sum of each row, each column, and diagonals is \( 15 \).

2. **Grid Traversal:** 
   - Traverse each possible 3x3 subgrid in the m x n grid.
   - Check if the subgrid is a magic square.

3. **Validation:**
   - Ensure each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once.
   - Validate sums of rows, columns, and diagonals.

## Code

```javascript
function numMagicSquaresInside(grid) {
    const isMagicSquare = (grid, row, col) => {
        const nums = new Array(10).fill(false);
        let sum = 0;
        for (let r = row; r < row + 3; r++) {
            for (let c = col; c < col + 3; c++) {
                const val = grid[r][c];
                if (val < 1 || val > 9 || nums[val]) return false;
                nums[val] = true;
                sum += val;
            }
        }
        if (sum !== 45) return false;

        return (
            grid[row][col] + grid[row][col+1] + grid[row][col+2] === 15 &&
            grid[row+1][col] + grid[row+1][col+1] + grid[row+1][col+2] === 15 &&
            grid[row+2][col] + grid[row+2][col+1] + grid[row+2][col+2] === 15 &&
            grid[row][col] + grid[row+1][col] + grid[row+2][col] === 15 &&
            grid[row][col+1] + grid[row+1][col+1] + grid[row+2][col+1] === 15 &&
            grid[row][col+2] + grid[row+1][col+2] + grid[row+2][col+2] === 15 &&
            grid[row][col] + grid[row+1][col+1] + grid[row+2][col+2] === 15 &&
            grid[row][col+2] + grid[row+1][col+1] + grid[row+2][col] === 15
        );
    };

    let count = 0;
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    for (let i = 0; i <= m - 3; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n - 3; j++) {
            if (isMagicSquare(grid, i, j)) count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Nested Loop Traversal:**
   - The outer loop runs \( (m-2) \) times.
   - The inner loop runs \( (n-2) \) times.
   - Each \(3x3\) subgrid validation checks a constant number of elements.

2. **Overall Complexity:** 
   - Both loops together: \(O((m-2) \times (n-2) \times 1)\)
   - Simplifying to \(O(m \times n)\).

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the given grid.
