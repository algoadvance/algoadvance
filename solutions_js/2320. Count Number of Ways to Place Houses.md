[Leetcode 2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2320)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer n representing the length of a street. The street is divided into n plots, and each plot can either have a house or be empty. However, there cannot be two adjacent houses on the street.

Calculate the total number of ways to place houses on these plots such that no two houses are next to each other. Since the answer might be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `n` is 0?**
   - Since no houses and no plots exist, return 1 because there's exactly one way to do nothing.

2. **What about the edge cases like the minimum and maximum limits of `n`?**
   - Minimum value of `n` is 1, as given.
   - The upper constraints of `n` is not defined, but should typically be within a range that can be handled by integer calculations.

3. **Should the plot placements be distinct for different values of `n`?**
   - Yes, for each value of `n`, we need to find the number of valid placements independently.

## Strategy

This is a dynamic programming problem where:
- Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to place houses on a street of length `i`.
- For a plot to be empty (`E`), the count would be equivalent to the way to arrange houses on `i - 1` plots (`dp[i-1]`).
- For a plot to have a house (`H`), the next plot must be empty (`E`), thus the count would be equivalent to the way to arrange houses on `i - 2` plots (`dp[i-2]`).

The recursive formula would be: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

We need to also consider the problem modulo `10^9 + 7`.

To start:
- There’s exactly 1 way to arrange houses in plots of length 0 (`dp[0] = 1`).
- There’s exactly 2 ways to arrange houses in plots of length 1 (one house or no house), `dp[1] = 2`.

Finally, to get the total number of ways for a given `n`, we have to compute the square of `dp[n]`.

## Code

```javascript
const MOD = 1000000007;

function countWaysToPlaceHouses(n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;

    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 2;

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD;
    }

    return (dp[n] * dp[n]) % MOD;
}

// Example Use Case
console.log(countWaysToPlaceHouses(1)); // Output: 4
console.log(countWaysToPlaceHouses(2)); // Output: 9
console.log(countWaysToPlaceHouses(3)); // Output: 25
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate from 2 to `n` to fill up the DP array.

The space complexity is also O(n) as we use an array of size `n + 1`. This solution can be optimized further to O(1) space if we only keep track of the last two computed values instead of the whole array.
