[Leetcode 591. Tag Validator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l591)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string representing a code snippet. You need to implement a validator to check if every start tag has a corresponding end tag and if every end tag has a matching start tag, following these rules:

1. A tag is formed by `<TAG_NAME>`, where `TAG_NAME` consists of uppercase letters, and `TAG_NAME` is at most 9 characters long.
2. The content between tags, except for tags themselves, can include any characters except the special characters `<` and `>`.
3. A valid `<![CDATA[...]]>` tag can also appear in the content to escape special characters `<` and `>`. Once inside `CDATA`, the string `]]>` is its only termination sequence.
4. All tags must be appropriately nested within each other.

Return `true` if the code is valid, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the code snippet be empty?**  
   - No, the input is assumed to be a non-empty string.

2. **How do we treat self-closing tags or tags that appear out of order?**  
   - Self-closing tags or tags that do not follow proper nesting rules should be considered invalid.

3. **Are there any specific constraints on the length or the characters of the input?**  
   - The input length is implicitly constrained by practical limits, and the text between tags can contain any characters except for `<` and `>`.

## Strategy

1. Use a stack to ensure matching and proper nesting for start and end tags.
2. Utilize regular expressions to detect tags and CDATA blocks.
3. Process each detected component (tag or CDATA block) sequentially:
   - Push start tags onto a stack.
   - Ensure end tags match the most recent start tag on the stack.
4. Ensure that after processing all tags, the stack should be empty (all tags matched and nested properly).
5. Enforce constraints for valid tags and ensure CDATA sections are used correctly.

## Code

```javascript
function isValid(code) {
    const tag_name = /^[A-Z]{1,9}$/;
    const CDATA = /^<!\[CDATA\[.*?\]\]>$/;
    
    let stack = [];
    let i = 0;
    
    while (i < code.length) {
        if (i > 0 && stack.length === 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (code.startsWith("<![CDATA[", i)) {
            let j = i + 9;
            i = code.indexOf("]]>", j);
            if (i === -1) return false;
            i += 3;
        } else if (code.startsWith("</", i)) {
            let j = i + 2;
            i = code.indexOf(">", j);
            if (i === -1) return false;
            
            let tag = code.substring(j, i);
            if (!tag.match(tag_name)) return false;
            
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== tag) return false;
            i++;
        } else if (code.startsWith("<", i)) {
            let j = i + 1;
            i = code.indexOf(">", j);
            if (i === -1) return false;
            
            let tag = code.substring(j, i);
            if (!tag.match(tag_name)) return false;
            
            stack.push(tag);
            i++;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The entire code snippet is processed linearly, once by the while loop and potentially inner loop operations like `indexOf` which also run in linear time in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The stack can contain up to `n` tags in the worst-case scenario, contributing linear space complexity.

This solution is efficient and ensures that each tag and CDATA block are properly validated and nested according to the given rules.
