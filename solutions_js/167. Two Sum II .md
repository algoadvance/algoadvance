[Leetcode 167. Two Sum II ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l167)
### Problem Statement
Given a 1-indexed array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an array `[index1, index2]`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input array size?**
   - Example response: The input array `numbers` can have a length from 2 to 10^3.
   
2. **What is the range of the elements in the array?**
   - Example response: The elements in `numbers` can range from -10^3 to 10^3.
   
3. **What if all elements are negative?**
   - The solution approach still holds as long as the array is sorted and the sum `target` is within achievable range of those elements.

4. **Can the same element be used twice?**
   - No, each input will have exactly one solution where indices differ.

### Strategy
We can use a two-pointer strategy to solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time, where n is the length of `numbers`.

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - Left Pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning of the array.
   - Right Pointer (`right`) starts at the end of the array.

2. **Iteratively Adjust Pointers**:
   - Calculate `current_sum` as the sum of the elements at the two pointers.
   - If `current_sum` is equal to `target`, return the indices (`left + 1`, `right + 1`).
   - If `current_sum` is less than `target`, increment the `left` pointer to increase the sum.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `target`, decrement the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

3. **Repeat** until the correct pair is found.

### Code
```javascript
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        
        if (current_sum === target) {
            return [left + 1, right + 1];
        } else if (current_sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else { // current_sum > target
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    // Since there's always exactly one solution as per the problem statement, 
    // we should not reach here.
    return [];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `numbers`. This is because each element will be looked at most once as the left and right pointers traverse the array from both ends.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), auxiliary space since we're using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures the solution is both efficient and straightforward given the input constraints.
