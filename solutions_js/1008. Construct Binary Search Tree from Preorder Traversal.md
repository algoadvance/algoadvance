[Leetcode 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1008)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `preorder`, which represents the preorder traversal of a binary search tree (BST), construct the BST and return its root.

**Example:**
```
Input: [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]
Output: [8, 5, 10, 1, 7, null, 12]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the structure of the tree node?
   - Typically, a tree node consists of a value, a left child, and a right child.
2. Can there be duplicate values in the `preorder` array?
   - Usually, BSTs do not contain duplicate values. For this problem, let's assume there are no duplicates.
3. How do we output the tree?
   - In coding problems like this, you typically return the root of the constructed BST.

### Strategy
1. **Preorder Traversal in BST**: This means the first element is the root. For each subsequent element, if it is less than the root, it goes to the left subtree; otherwise, it goes to the right subtree.
2. **Recursive Construction**: Use a helper function to recursively build the tree.
   - **Base Case**: If the start index is greater than the end index, return `null`.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The first element of the given range in preorder traversal is the root.
     - Find the first element larger than the root to determine the boundary between left and right subtrees.
     - Recursively construct the left and right subtrees.

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function bstFromPreorder(preorder) {
    if (!preorder.length) return null;

    let buildTree = (start, end) => {
        if (start > end) return null;
        
        let rootVal = preorder[start];
        let root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
        
        // Find the boundary for left and right subtree
        let splitIndex = start + 1;
        while (splitIndex <= end && preorder[splitIndex] < rootVal) {
            splitIndex++;
        }
        
        root.left = buildTree(start + 1, splitIndex - 1);
        root.right = buildTree(splitIndex, end);
        
        return root;
    };

    return buildTree(0, preorder.length - 1);
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The construction of the tree is performed once for each node. In the worst case, each recursive call scans the range of elements, so the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).
  - The worst case occurs when the tree becomes skewed (like a linked list), e.g., for an input like [10, 9, 8, 7].
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the recursion stack and the creation of tree nodes.

### Conclusion
This solution constructs the BST from the given preorder traversal using a recursive approach and covers the BST properties efficiently. The next step would be to test the function with various cases (including edge cases) to ensure its correctness.
