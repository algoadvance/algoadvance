[Leetcode 2126. Destroying Asteroids](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2126)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `mass` representing the initial mass of a planet and an integer array `asteroids` where `asteroids[i]` is the mass of the `i`-th asteroid. You can destroy an asteroid if your mass is greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass. When you destroy an asteroid, your mass increases by that asteroid's mass. Return `true` if you can destroy all asteroids. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1
```
Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3, 9, 19, 5, 21]
Output: true
Explanation: 
- You start with a mass of 10.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 3 and increase your mass to 13.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 5 and increase your mass to 18.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 9 and increase your mass to 27.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 19 and increase your mass to 46.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 21 and increase your mass to 67.
All asteroids are destroyed.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: mass = 5, asteroids = [4, 9, 23]
Output: false
Explanation:
- You start with a mass of 5.
- You destroy the asteroid with mass 4 and increase your mass to 9.
- You cannot destroy the asteroid with mass 9 since your mass is equal to it.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the masses of the asteroids guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Can we assume that the `mass` of the planet is always a positive integer?
3. Is there a constraint on the size of the asteroids array?
4. How large can the values in `mass` and `asteroids` be?

## Strategy

1. **Sort Asteroids**: First, sort the asteroids array in ascending order. This way, we can always try to destroy the smallest asteroid first, ensuring that we maximize our mass increment early on.
2. **Iterate and Destroy**: Iterate through the sorted array, and at each step, check if the current mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass. If yes, destroy the asteroid and add its mass to your current mass. If no, break out of the loop and return `false`, as you cannot destroy this asteroid.
3. **Final Check**: If you successfully go through all asteroids, return `true`.
  
## Code

```javascript
function canDestroyAllAsteroids(mass, asteroids) {
    // Sort the array of asteroids
    asteroids.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (let i = 0; i < asteroids.length; i++) {
        // If the mass of the planet is less than the current asteroid
        if (mass < asteroids[i]) {
            return false;
        }
        // Destroy the asteroid and increase the mass
        mass += asteroids[i];
    }
    // All asteroids were destroyed
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `asteroids` array takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the sorted array takes `O(n)`.

The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. The space complexity is `O(1)` if we consider the input array does not count towards additional space usage.

With this solution, we maximize the chance of successfully destroying all asteroids by ensuring we always attempt to destroy the smallest possible asteroids first.
