[Leetcode 1240. Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1240)
### Problem Statement

Given a rectangle of size `n x m`, return the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the dimensions of the rectangle?
   - **A:** The dimensions `n` and `m` will be positive integers where `1 <= n, m <= 13`.

2. **Q:** Can the sides of the squares have any integer length within the dimensions?
   - **A:** Yes, the sides of the squares can be any integer length that fits within the dimensions of the rectangle being tiled.

3. **Q:** Is there a specific orientation or position for placing the squares?
   - **A:** No specific orientation; you can place the squares anywhere within the rectangle as long as they fit without overlapping and cover the entire rectangle.

### Strategy

Given the problem constraints, using a backtracking approach combined with dynamic programming/memoization is a suitable approach. Here’s the plan:

1. **State Representation:** A 2D grid to represent the tiling of the rectangle.
2. **Backtracking:** Try placing the largest possible square at each empty cell and backtrack if it doesn't lead to an optimal solution.
3. **Memoization:** Store the results of subproblems in a map to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript solution implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
var tilingRectangle = function(n, m) {
    let memo = new Map();
    
    const placeSquare = (grid, i, j, size, fill) => {
        for (let x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
            for (let y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                grid[x][y] = fill;
            }
        }
    };

    const canPlace = (grid, i, j, size) => {
        if (i + size > n || j + size > m) return false;
        for (let x = i; x < i + size; x++) {
            for (let y = j; y < j + size; y++) {
                if (grid[x][y] === 1) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    const findMinSquares = (grid) => {
        let key = grid.map(row => row.join('')).join('');
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);

        let minCount = Infinity;

        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                    for (let size = Math.min(n-i, m-j); size > 0; size--) {
                        if (canPlace(grid, i, j, size)) {
                            placeSquare(grid, i, j, size, 1);

                            minCount = Math.min(minCount, 1 + findMinSquares(grid));

                            placeSquare(grid, i, j, size, 0);
                        }
                    }
                    memo.set(key, minCount);
                    return minCount;
                }
            }
        }

        return 0;
    };

    let grid = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m).fill(0));
    return findMinSquares(grid);
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is hard to determine exactly due to the nature of the backtracking with memoization. However, the complexity is greatly reduced by the use of memoization, which avoids redundant computations by caching the results of previously computed states.

Given the constraints (n, m ≤ 13), this method should perform efficiently within allowable execution time for most practical purposes in a competitive programming scenario.
