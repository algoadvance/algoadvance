[Leetcode 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1334)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of cities, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from_i` and `to_i`.

You are also given an integer `distanceThreshold`.

Your task is to find the city with the smallest number of neighbors at a threshold distance. If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `edges`?**
   - The number of cities `n` can be between 2 to 100. The values in `edges` can range from 1 to the max `n`.

2. **What is the range of possible weights for the edges?**
   - The weights can be any integer from 1 up to a maximum of 10^4.

3. **How should ties be handled?**
   - If there are multiple cities with the smallest number of neighbors, return the city with the greatest numerical id.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities because it is well-suited for dense graphs and handles the weighted edges well.

1. **Initialize** a matrix `dist` where `dist[i][j]` is initialized to `infinity`, representing the distance between city `i` and city `j`. Set `dist[i][i]` to 0 for all cities `i`.
2. **Populate** initial distances using the given `edges`.
3. **Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm** to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of cities.
4. **Count** the number of neighbors within the `distanceThreshold` for each city.
5. **Determine** the city with the smallest number of neighbors within the threshold. In case of ties, choose the city with the greatest id.

### Code

Here is the code to achieve the above plan:

```javascript
function findTheCity(n, edges, distanceThreshold) {
    const INF = Infinity;
    let dist = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(INF));
    
    // Initialize the distances with edges information
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }
    for (const [from, to, weight] of edges) {
        dist[from][to] = weight;
        dist[to][from] = weight;
    }

    // Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs
    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let minNeighbors = Infinity;
    let city = -1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let neighborCount = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i !== j && dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                neighborCount++;
            }
        }
        if (neighborCount < minNeighbors || (neighborCount === minNeighbors && i > city)) {
            minNeighbors = neighborCount;
            city = i;
        }
    }

    return city;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization** of the distance matrix: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Populating Initial Distances**: \(O(|edges|)\).
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: \(O(n^3)\).
- **Counting Neighbors**: \(O(n^2)\).

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, making it \(O(n^3)\). Given the constraints of \(n \leq 100\), this is an efficient approach.
