[Leetcode 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1026)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, your task is to find the maximum value `v` for which there exist different nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`. A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either `a` is equal to `b` or any child of `a` is a (direct or indirect) ancestor of `b`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the tree contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the tree can contain negative values.

2. **What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The tree can have up to 10^5 nodes.

3. **Is the tree always non-empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume the tree is non-empty as per the problem constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum difference between any node and its ancestor. We can employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to traverse the tree while keeping track of the minimum and maximum values encountered from the root to the current node. For each node, the potential maximum difference is the larger of the absolute differences between the current node's value and both the minimum and maximum values tracked so far.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Start from the root node and use a stack or recursion to traverse the tree.
2. **Track Min and Max**: At each node, record the minimum and maximum values from the root to that node.
3. **Calculate Differences**: For each node, calculate the absolute difference with the current min and max values.
4. **Update Maximum Difference**: Keep updating the maximum difference encountered.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxAncestorDiff = function(root) {
    let maxDifference = 0;
    
    function dfs(node, currentMin, currentMax) {
        if (!node) return;

        // Update the current difference
        let potentialMaxDiff = Math.max(Math.abs(node.val - currentMin), Math.abs(node.val - currentMax));
        maxDifference = Math.max(maxDifference, potentialMaxDiff);

        // Update the current min and max
        currentMin = Math.min(currentMin, node.val);
        currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, node.val);

        // Recur to left and right children
        dfs(node.left, currentMin, currentMax);
        dfs(node.right, currentMin, currentMax);
    }

    dfs(root, root.val, root.val);
    return maxDifference;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

The space complexity is `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack used during the DFS traversal. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height `H` can be `N`, leading to O(N) space complexity. For a balanced tree, the height would be `log(N)`, leading to O(log(N)) space complexity.
