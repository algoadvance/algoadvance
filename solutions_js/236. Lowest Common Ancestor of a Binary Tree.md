[Leetcode 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l236)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints of the problem?**
   - Each node in the binary tree has a unique value.
   - Both `p` and `q` are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

2. **What should be the output if `p` is an ancestor of `q`?**
   - The output should be `p`, since `p` is the lowest node with both `p` and `q` as descendants.

3. **Can `p` or `q` be the root itself?**
   - Yes, either `p` or `q` can be the root.

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - We'll use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree.
   - If we find either `p` or `q`, we return that node.
   - If a subtree does not contain either `p` or `q`, we return `null`.
   - If both left and right subtrees return non-null values, the current node is the LCA.

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left=null, right=null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }
    
    // Recur for left and right subtrees
    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    
    // If both left and right are not null, root is LCA
    if (left !== null && right !== null) {
        return root;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, check if left subtree or right subtree is the LCA
    return left !== null ? left : right;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
   - In the worst case, we visit each node of the binary tree once, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`
   - This is due to the recursion stack, where `H` is the height of the tree. In the worst case of a skewed tree, it could be `O(N)`.

This approach ensures that we accurately find the lowest common ancestor efficiently using DFS traversal.
