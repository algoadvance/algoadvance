[Leetcode 3168. Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3168)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of meeting arrival and departure times for a set of meetings. Each meeting will have two times `arrive` and `depart`. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of chairs required in the waiting room so that at no point in time a person is standing.

**Example:**
- Input: `meetings = [[1, 5], [2, 6], [4, 7]]`
- Output: `3`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input values?**
   - Arrival and departure times are non-negative integers within reasonable bounds (e.g., \(0 \le arrive < depart \le 10^6\)).
   
2. **Can meetings overlap exactly at the start and end times?**
   - Yes, meetings can overlap and start exactly at the same time another meeting ends.

3. **Are inputs guaranteed to be sorted?**
   - No, they may not be sorted. We need to handle unsorted input.

4. **Can there be empty meetings?**
   - Yes, if there are no meetings, the output should be `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check how many meetings overlap at any single point in time.
   - We can use a two-pointer technique or events-based approach to solve this.

2. **Approach:**
   - Use two sorted lists: one for arrival times and one for departure times.
   - Traverse both lists to determine maximum overlap.

3. **Steps:**
   - Extract and sort all arrival and departure times.
   - Use two pointers to track current arrivals and departures.
   - Iterate through time points and keep a count of chairs needed, updating the max as required.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
var minChairs = function(meetings) {
    if (meetings.length === 0) return 0;

    // Extract and sort arrival and departure times
    const arrivals = meetings.map(meeting => meeting[0]).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const departures = meetings.map(meeting => meeting[1]).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let arr_ptr = 0, dep_ptr = 0;
    let chairs = 0, max_chairs = 0;

    while (arr_ptr < arrivals.length && dep_ptr < departures.length) {
        if (arrivals[arr_ptr] < departures[dep_ptr]) {
            // A new person arrives before the next person leaves
            chairs++;
            arr_ptr++;
        } else {
            // A person leaves
            chairs--;
            dep_ptr++;
        }
        max_chairs = Math.max(max_chairs, chairs);
    }
    
    return max_chairs;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(minChairs([[1, 5], [2, 6], [4, 7]])); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the arrival and departure times takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of meetings.
- **Two-pointer traversal** through the sorted lists takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

- Storing sorted arrays for arrivals and departures takes \(O(n)\) space.

Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).
