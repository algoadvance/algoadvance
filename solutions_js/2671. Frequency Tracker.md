[Leetcode 2671. Frequency Tracker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2671)
### Problem Statement

Create a `FrequencyTracker` class that allows you to efficiently track the frequency of integers, and query which frequencies are present.

The class should support the following methods:
- `add(int number)` - Adds the given number to the data structure.
- `deleteOne(int number)` - Deletes one occurrence of the given number from the data structure. If the number does not exist in the data structure, do nothing.
- `hasFrequency(int frequency)` - Returns true if there is at least one integer in the data structure that is present exactly `frequency` times, otherwise returns false.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `number` be negative?
   - Typically, integers can include negatives, but let's assume only non-negative integers unless stated otherwise.
2. Should we handle very large numbers (both in values and in amounts of operations)?
   - Generally, yes.
3. Is there a limit on the numbers to be added? 
   - The problem statement doesn't specify a limit, so assume a reasonable usage scenario.

### Strategy

1. We will maintain a map `numberFrequencyMap` to keep track of the frequency of each number.
2. We will also maintain another map `frequencyCountMap` to keep track of how many numbers have a certain frequency.

**Methods:**

1. `add(number)`: 
   - Update the `numberFrequencyMap` to increase the count of the given number.
   - Adjust the `frequencyCountMap` to reflect this change.

2. `deleteOne(number)`:
   - Check if the number exists in `numberFrequencyMap`, and if the frequency is positive.
   - If so, decrease the count of the given number in `numberFrequencyMap`.
   - Adjust the `frequencyCountMap` accordingly.

3. `hasFrequency(frequency)`:
   - Simply check in the `frequencyCountMap` if there is at least one number with the given frequency.

### Time Complexity

- `add(number)`: O(1)
- `deleteOne(number)`: O(1)
- `hasFrequency(frequency)`: O(1)

### Code

```javascript
class FrequencyTracker {
    constructor() {
        this.numberFrequencyMap = new Map();
        this.frequencyCountMap = new Map();
    }

    add(number) {
        if (this.numberFrequencyMap.has(number)) {
            let prevFreq = this.numberFrequencyMap.get(number);
            this.numberFrequencyMap.set(number, prevFreq + 1);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(prevFreq, -1);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(prevFreq + 1, 1);
        } else {
            this.numberFrequencyMap.set(number, 1);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(1, 1);
        }
    }

    deleteOne(number) {
        if (!this.numberFrequencyMap.has(number)) {
            return;
        }

        let currentFreq = this.numberFrequencyMap.get(number);

        if (currentFreq === 1) {
            this.numberFrequencyMap.delete(number);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(1, -1);
        } else {
            this.numberFrequencyMap.set(number, currentFreq - 1);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(currentFreq, -1);
            this._updateFrequencyCount(currentFreq - 1, 1);
        }
    }

    hasFrequency(frequency) {
        return (this.frequencyCountMap.get(frequency) || 0) > 0;
    }

    _updateFrequencyCount(frequency, delta) {
        if (!this.frequencyCountMap.has(frequency)) {
            this.frequencyCountMap.set(frequency, 0);
        }
        this.frequencyCountMap.set(frequency, this.frequencyCountMap.get(frequency) + delta);
        if (this.frequencyCountMap.get(frequency) <= 0) {
            this.frequencyCountMap.delete(frequency);
        }
    }
}
```

This code provides a compact and efficient implementation to track frequencies of integers using two maps, ensuring that all operations are constant time.
