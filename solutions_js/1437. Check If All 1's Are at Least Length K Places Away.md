[Leetcode 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1437)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s, and an integer `k`, return `true` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**:
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `k`?
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the function behave if the array contains no `1`s?
   - How should the function behave if `k` is larger than the length of `nums`?
   
### Strategy
1. Initialize a variable `previousOneIndex` to keep track of the index of the last seen `1` (initially set to `-k-1` which ensures the first `1` won't cause an immediate failure).
2. Iterate through the `nums` array. For every `1` found at index `i`:
   - Check if `i - previousOneIndex` is less than or equal to `k`.
     - If true, return `false`.
     - If false, update `previousOneIndex` to `i`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any violations, return `true`.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves a single pass through the array, so the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

### Code

```javascript
function kLengthApart(nums, k) {
    let previousOneIndex = -k-1; // Initialize to a valid point considering k
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            if (i - previousOneIndex <= k) {
                return false;
            }
            previousOneIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(kLengthApart([1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], 2)); // true
console.log(kLengthApart([1,0,0,1,0,1], 2)); // false
console.log(kLengthApart([1,1,1,1,1,1], 0)); // true
console.log(kLengthApart([0,1,0,1], 1)); // true
console.log(kLengthApart([0,0,0,0], 1)); // true, edge case with no 1s
console.log(kLengthApart([], 1)); // true, edge case with empty array
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the distance between consecutive `1`s in the array, adhering to the required condition.
