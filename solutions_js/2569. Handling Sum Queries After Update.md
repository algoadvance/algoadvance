[Leetcode 2569. Handling Sum Queries After Update](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2569)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, and an array of queries where queries[i] = [type_i, index_i, value_i].

- `nums1` is of length `n` and `nums2` is of length `m`.
- `queries` contains some queries which need to be processed for the `nums1` and `nums2`.

Queries can be of three types:
1. If type_i == 1, update `nums1` at index `index_i` to `value_i`.
2. If type_i == 2, add `value_i` to all elements of `nums2`.
3. If type_i == 3, return the sum of `nums2` after applying all previous type 2 queries since the start.

Your task is to process all queries and return an array of sums from all type 3 queries.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input and Output Sizes**: 
   - What are the maximum sizes for `nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries`?
     - Typically, in Leetcode problems, the sizes can go up to $10^5$.
   - Are we guaranteed valid inputs (index ranges and query types)?
     - Assuming inputs will always be valid as per constraints mentioned.
     
2. **Behavior on Edge Cases**: 
   - Does `nums2` get affected for type 3 queries after having type 1 queries mixed in?
     - Since type 1 queries do not affect the content of nums2, it won't matter.

### Code

```javascript
function handleQueries(nums1, nums2, queries) {
    let cumulativeAdd = 0;
    let results = [];
    
    queries.forEach(query => {
        const [type, index, value] = query;
        
        if (type === 1) {
            nums1[index] = value;
        } 
        else if (type === 2) {
            cumulativeAdd += value;
        } 
        else if (type === 3) {
            const sum = nums2.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num + cumulativeAdd, 0);
            results.push(sum);
        }
    });
    
    return results;
}

// Example usage:
const nums1 = [1, 2, 3];
const nums2 = [10, 20, 30];
const queries = [
    [1, 1, 5],     // nums1 becomes [1, 5, 3]
    [2, 0, 10],    // add 10 to all of nums2, cumulativeAdd is now 10
    [3, 0, 0],     // output sum of nums2 + cumulativeAdd = [20, 30, 40], sum = 90
    [2, 0, 5],     // add 5 to all of nums2, cumulativeAdd is now 15
    [3, 0, 0],     // output sum of nums2 + cumulativeAdd = [25, 35, 45], sum = 105
];

console.log(handleQueries(nums1, nums2, queries)); // [90, 105]
```

### Strategy

1. **Type 1 Queries**: Directly apply the value update to `nums1` at the specified index.
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   
2. **Type 2 Queries**: Maintain a cumulative addition value to add to every element of `nums2`.
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   
3. **Type 3 Queries**: Calculate the sum of `nums2` with the cumulative addition value applied.
   - Time Complexity: O(m), due to iterating over `nums2`.

### Time Complexity

- **Overall Time Complexity**: 
  - For type 1 and type 2 queries: O(1).
  - For type 3 queries: O(m), where `m` is the length of `nums2`.
  - In worst case, if all queries are of type 3, the complexity would be O(k*m) where k is the number of queries.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - O(1) additional space for tracking cumulative addition and results array for type 3 results. The result array can have up to `k` elements where `k` is the number of type 3 queries in the input.
