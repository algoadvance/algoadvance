[Leetcode 1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1304)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, return any array containing `n` unique integers such that they add up to zero.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `n` be negative?
   - No, `n` will be a positive integer as per the problem constraints.
2. What is the range of `n`?
   - Typically, constraints would let `n` be within a reasonable amount, say up to 1000 or more, but specifics aren't provided here.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, let's observe the following:
- If `n` is 1, the only array that can sum up to zero is `[0]`.
- For `n > 1`, we need to include both positive and negative numbers, balancing them out to zero.
  
Given `n`:
1. When `n` is odd, we can include 0 to make the sum zero. The remaining elements will be pairs of negative and positive integers.
2. When `n` is even, we don't need zero, just pairs of negative and positive integers.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty array `result`.
2. If `n` is odd, add `0` to the array.
3. Add pairs of integers `[-i, i]` to the array where `i` ranges from 1 to `floor(n/2)`.

### Time Complexity:
- The solution involves generating `n` elements and thus will have a time complexity of O(n).

### Code:

```javascript
function sumZero(n) {
    let result = [];
    
    // If n is odd, start by adding 0
    if (n % 2 !== 0) {
        result.push(0);
        n -= 1;
    }
    
    // Now n is even, add pairs (-i, i)
    for (let i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
        result.push(-i);
        result.push(i);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `sumZero(n)` first checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the code adds `0` to the result array and decrements `n` by 1.
- Then, it iterates from `1` to `n/2`, adding `i` and `-i` pairs to the result array.
- The generated array contains `n` unique integers that sum to zero and is then returned.

By following the above-explained strategy and code, we ensure that the array generation is efficient and meets the problem requirements.
