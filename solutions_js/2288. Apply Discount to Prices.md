[Leetcode 2288. Apply Discount to Prices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2288)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string, `sentence`, that contains a list of words. Each word is separated by a single space without leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of either lowercase or uppercase letters or represents a price (a positive number followed by a dollar sign $). 

For example, "$100", "500$", or "$30.00" are considered prices. We are required to apply a discount of some value `discount` to every price in the sentence and return the modified string where all the prices have the given discount applied.

For example:
- Input: `sentence = "The total is $100 and the discount is 20%"`, `discount = 20`
- Output: `"The total is $80.00 and the discount is 20%"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Discount Calculation**: How is the discount calculated? 
    - The discount is a percentage of the price.
2. **Price Format**: How should the prices be formatted in the output?
    - Prices should be formatted in a fixed two-decimal point format (e.g., `80.00`).
3. **Edge Cases**: 
    - Should we handle inputs where the price values are invalid (e.g., missing dollar signs)?
    - Should we validate the input format strictly?

## Strategy

1. **Split Sentence**: Break the sentence into words based on spaces.
2. **Identify Prices**: Identify words that represent prices (they will have a dollar sign).
3. **Calculate Discounted Price**: Calculate the discounted price using the given percentage.
4. **Format Prices**: Ensure the prices are formatted to two decimal points.
5. **Reconstruct Sentence**: Reconstruct the sentence with updated prices.

## Code

```javascript
function discountPrices(sentence, discount) {
    const words = sentence.split(' '); // Split the sentence into words
    const discountFactor = (100 - discount) / 100; // Calculate the discount factor

    // Function to format a discounted price
    function formatPrice(price) {
        return '$' + price.toFixed(2); // Format to two decimal places
    }

    // Helper function to check if a word is a price
    function isPrice(word) {
        if (word.startsWith('$')) {
            const numberPart = word.slice(1);
            return !isNaN(numberPart) && numberPart !== '';
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Process each word
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        const word = words[i];
        if (isPrice(word)) {
            const originalPrice = parseFloat(word.slice(1)); // Extract number from price
            const discountedPrice = originalPrice * discountFactor; // Apply the discount
            words[i] = formatPrice(discountedPrice); // Update the word in the array
        }
    }

    return words.join(' '); // Join words back into a sentence
}

// Example usage:
const sentence = "The total is $100 and the discount is 20%";
const discount = 20;
console.log(discountPrices(sentence, discount)); // Output: "The total is $80.00 and the discount is 20%"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. This complexity arises from processing each word in the sentence and calculating the discounted prices.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. We use extra space for storing the split words and the resultant transformed sentence.

This implementation ensures each word is processed appropriately, and prices are correctly formatted with the applied discount.
