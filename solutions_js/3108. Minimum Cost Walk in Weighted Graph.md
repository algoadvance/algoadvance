[Leetcode 3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3108)
## Problem Statement

You are given a connected, undirected, and weighted graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to `n`. You are also given a source node `src` and a destination node `dest`. Your task is to find the minimum cost to walk from the source to the destination.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Representation**
   - How is the graph represented in the input? Typically, a list of edges might be provided where each edge is specified by two nodes and a weight.

2. **Edge Weights**
   - Can the edge weights be negative? (Assume weights are non-negative if not specified)

3. **Input Constraints**
   - What are the constraints on `n`, `m`, the ranges of weights, and node values?

4. **Expected Output**
   - Should the output be the minimum cost, or is there any additional information required? (Typically, it's just the minimum cost)

For the sake of an explanation, let’s assume:
- The graph is given as an array of edges.
- Edge weights are non-negative.
- You need to find the minimum cost from `src` to `dest`.

## Strategy

To find the minimum cost to walk from the source to the destination in a weighted undirected graph, you can use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is well-suited for graphs with non-negative weights and will efficiently find the shortest path.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize a Min-Heap (Priority Queue)**: Use to always extend the smallest known distance.
2. **Distance Array**: Maintain the minimum distance to each node.
3. **Set Source Distance to Zero**: Start from the source node.
4. **Relax All Edges**: For the current shortest path, update the distances to neighboring nodes.
5. **Repeat Until All Nodes Processed or Destination Found**: Follow the algorithm until all nodes are processed or the destination node's shortest path is found.

## Code

Here’s an implementation using Dijkstra's algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minimumCostWalk(n, edges, src, dest) {
    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => []);
    const distances = Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue();

    // Convert edges to adjacency list
    for (const [u, v, w] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push([v, w]);
        adjList[v].push([u, w]); // Assuming undirected graph
    }

    // Initialize the start node
    distances[src] = 0;
    minHeap.enqueue(src, 0);

    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
        const { element: currentNode, priority: currentDist } = minHeap.dequeue();

        // Early exit if we reach the destination
        if (currentNode === dest) {
            return currentDist;
        }

        for (const [neighbor, weight] of adjList[currentNode]) {
            const newDist = currentDist + weight;
            if (newDist < distances[neighbor]) {
                distances[neighbor] = newDist;
                minHeap.enqueue(neighbor, newDist);
            }
        }
    }

    // If there is no path from src to dest
    return distances[dest] === Infinity ? -1 : distances[dest];
}

// Priority Queue Class Implementation
class MinPriorityQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.nodes = [];
    }

    enqueue(element, priority) {
        this.nodes.push({ element, priority });
        this.bubbleUp();
    }

    dequeue() {
        const min = this.nodes[0];
        const end = this.nodes.pop();
        if (this.nodes.length > 0) {
            this.nodes[0] = end;
            this.sinkDown();
        }
        return min;
    }

    bubbleUp() {
        let index = this.nodes.length - 1;
        const element = this.nodes[index];
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            const parent = this.nodes[parentIndex];
            if (element.priority >= parent.priority) break;
            this.nodes[parentIndex] = element;
            this.nodes[index] = parent;
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }

    sinkDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.nodes.length;
        const element = this.nodes[0];
        while (true) {
            const leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            const rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.nodes[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild.priority < element.priority) {
                    swap = leftChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.nodes[rightChildIndex];
                if (
                    (swap === null && rightChild.priority < element.priority) ||
                    (swap !== null && rightChild.priority < leftChild.priority)
                ) {
                    swap = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (swap === null) break;
            this.nodes[index] = this.nodes[swap];
            this.nodes[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.nodes.length === 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm using a min-heap (priority queue) is `O((V + E) log V)` where:
- `V` is the number of vertices (nodes).
- `E` is the number of edges.

This is efficient for large graphs commonly encountered in competitive programming and technical interviews.
