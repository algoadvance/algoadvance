[Leetcode 1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1996)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attack_i, defense_i]` represents the properties of the i-th character in the game.

A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is weak if there exists another character `j` such that `attack_j > attack_i` and `defense_j > defense_i`.

Return the number of weak characters.

### Example
```javascript
Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0

Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1

Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints
- `2 <= properties.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= attack_i, defense_i <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the characters have the same attack and defense values?**
   A: Yes, characters can have the same values for attack and defense.
   
2. **Q: Is it possible to have multiple weak characters?**
   A: Yes, there can be multiple weak characters depending on the input.

3. **Q: What should be the return type of the function?**
   A: The function should return an integer representing the number of weak characters.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting the Characters**: First, we need to sort the characters based on two keys. We sort the characters first by attack in ascending order. If two characters have the same attack values, we sort them by defense in descending order. This prevents unnecessary comparison when two characters have the same attack value but different defense values.
   
2. **Tracking Maximum Defense**: As we iterate over the sorted list from the end, we keep track of the maximum defense encountered so far. For each character, we compare their defense with the maximum defense seen so far. If it's less, then the current character is weak.

3. **Counting Weak Characters**: We increment the count of weak characters whenever we find a character whose defense is less than the maximum defense seen so far.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} properties
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfWeakCharacters = function(properties) {
    // Sort properties by attack in ascending order and by defense in descending order if attacks are the same
    properties.sort((a, b) => a[0] === b[0] ? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);

    let maxDefense = 0;
    let weakCharacters = 0;

    // Traverse the sorted array from the end
    for (let i = properties.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // If current character's defense is less than max defense seen so far, it is a weak character
        if (properties[i][1] < maxDefense) {
            weakCharacters++;
        } else {
            // Update max defense with the current character's defense
            maxDefense = properties[i][1];
        }
    }

    return weakCharacters;
};

// Example usage:
// const properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]];
// console.log(numberOfWeakCharacters(properties)); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting operation takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of characters.
- **Traversal**: The subsequent traversal of the array takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach leverages sorting to reduce the complexity of comparisons and efficiently count the weak characters in the game.
