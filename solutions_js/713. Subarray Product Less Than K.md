[Leetcode 713. Subarray Product Less Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l713)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in the array all positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are positive integers.

2. **Is `k` guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

3. **What should be returned if no subarray matches the condition?**
   - If no subarray meets the criteria, return 0.

4. **Can the size of `nums` be large?**
   - Yes, the size of `nums` can be large. We need an efficient solution.

### Strategy

The problem can be efficiently solved using a two-pointer or sliding window approach. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `left`: the left pointer of the sliding window, start at 0.
   - `product`: to store the current product of the window, start at 1.
   - `count`: to count the number of valid subarrays, start at 0.

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer from 0 to the end of the array.
   - Multiply `product` by `nums[right]`.
   - If `product` is greater than or equal to `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right until `product` is less than `k`, adjusting the `product` accordingly.
   - Add `(right - left + 1)` to `count` because each position from `left` to `right` forms a valid subarray.

3. **Return the `count` after the iteration.**

### Code

```javascript
var numSubarrayProductLessThanK = function(nums, k) {
    if (k <= 1) return 0;  // Since all nums are positive, product >= 1, and if k <= 1, product < k is never true.
    
    let left = 0;
    let product = 1;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        product *= nums[right];
        
        while (product >= k && left <= right) {
            product /= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        
        count += (right - left + 1);  // Number of subarrays with right end at `right` and satisfying the condition
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
