[Leetcode 526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l526)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. You have to find the number of beautiful arrangements that you can construct with the numbers `1` to `n`.

A beautiful arrangement is defined as an array where for `i-th (1 <= i <= n)` position, one of the following is true:
- The number at the `i-th` position is divisible by `i`.
- `i` is divisible by the number at the `i-th` position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is `n` always going to be positive? (Yes, based on the statement.)
   - What is the maximum value for `n`? (This helps in understanding the upper bounds for time complexity)
   
2. **Output**:
   - Do I need to return the number of possible beautiful arrangements? (Yes.)

### Strategy

The problem involves permutations and checking each permutation if it satisfies the condition of a beautiful arrangement. A backtracking approach is suitable here:

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Use a function to try placing numbers at each position.
   - At each step, check if placing a number at the current index follows the beautiful arrangement rules.
   - Swap elements (or mark as used) and recurse.
   - Backtrack by undoing the changes made to try other possibilities.

### Code

Here is the solution:

```javascript
var countArrangement = function(n) {
    let count = 0;
    
    function backtrack(pos, remaining) {
        if (pos > n) {
            count++;
            return;
        }
        
        for (let i = 0; i < remaining.length; i++) {
            if (remaining[i] % pos === 0 || pos % remaining[i] === 0) {
                let newRemaining = remaining.slice();
                newRemaining.splice(i, 1);
                backtrack(pos + 1, newRemaining);
            }
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(1, Array.from({length: n}, (_, i) => i + 1));
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(countArrangement(2)); // Output: 2
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `countArrangement` function initializes the `count` variable to keep track of valid arrangements.
   - It calls the `backtrack` function starting from position 1 and with an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Backtracking Logic**:
   - The `backtrack` function takes the current position `pos` and the `remaining` list of numbers that have not been placed yet.
   - If `pos` exceeds `n`, it means all positions are filled validly, so increment `count`.
   - Iterate through the `remaining` numbers, try placing each number at the current position if it satisfies the beautiful arrangement rules.
   - Call `backtrack` recursively for the next position after updating the `remaining` array.
   - This recursive exploration covers all possible permutations, counting only the valid beautiful arrangements.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(k)` where `k` is the number of valid permutations. This is hard to determine exactly and depends on `n`, as invalid positions avoid unnecessary recursions.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the recursion stack and array handling at each recursion call.

This approach ensures that all possible arrangements are considered, and only valid ones are counted, making it an efficient solution within the constraints of practical values of `n`.
