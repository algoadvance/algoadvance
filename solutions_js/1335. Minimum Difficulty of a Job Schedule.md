[Leetcode 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1335)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum job difficulty during that day.

You want to split the job schedule into exactly `d` days. The sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days should be minimized.

If you cannot find a valid schedule, return -1.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First split the jobs into two days: [6,5] and [4,3,2,1]. The difficulty of the first day is 6 and the difficulty of the second day is 4+1. The sum is 6+1=7.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: There are not enough jobs to schedule for 4 days.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Each day has only one job, so the difficulty is the sum of each job's difficulty which is 1+1+1 = 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
    - \(1 \leq jobDifficulty.length \leq 300\)
    - \(0 \leq jobDifficulty[i] \leq 1000\)
    - \(1 \leq d \leq 10\)
   
2. **Details on invalid schedules:**
    - If the number of jobs is less than the number of days, return `-1`.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][k]` represents the minimum difficulty of scheduling the first `i` jobs over `k` days.

1. **Initialization:**
    - `dp[0][0]` = 0. No jobs in 0 days means no difficulty.
    - `dp[i][0]` = Infinite for all `i > 0` because we cannot assign jobs without days.
    - `dp[0][k]` = Infinite for all `k > 0` because we cannot assign days without jobs.

2. **State Transition:**
    - For each `i` jobs and `k` days, we need to iterate over possible splits and find the minimum difficulty. 
    - The `dp[i][k]` can be derived from the previous states by taking the maximum difficulty of the jobs in the current split added to the `dp` value of the jobs scheduled up to the previous split.

### Code

```javascript
var minDifficulty = function(jobDifficulty, d) {
    const n = jobDifficulty.length;
    if (n < d) return -1;

    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(null).map(() => new Array(d + 1).fill(Infinity));
    dp[0][0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (let k = 1; k <= d; ++k) {
            let maxDifficulty = 0;
            for (let j = i; j >= k; --j) {
                maxDifficulty = Math.max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[j - 1]);
                dp[i][k] = Math.min(dp[i][k], dp[j - 1][k - 1] + maxDifficulty);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][d];
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(n^2 \cdot d)\). Here's the breakdown:
- We have two nested loops for `i` and `k`.
- Inside the nested loops, we have another loop for `j`, which makes it quadratic in terms of `n`.

This complexity is reasonable given the problem constraints.
