[Leetcode 2706. Buy Two Chocolates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2706)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array called `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of the ith chocolate in a store. You are also given an integer `$`, and you need to find a pair of distinct chocolates such that the sum of their prices is less than or equal to `$`. Return the maximum possible sum of the pair that does not exceed `$`. If no such pair exists, return 0.

### Example:
- Input: `prices = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `$ = 5`
- Output: `5`

### Constraints:
- `2 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= $ <= 2 * 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be duplicate prices in the array?**
   - Yes, the problem statement does not specify that prices are unique, so duplicates are allowed.

2. **Can the price of a single chocolate be greater than `$`?**
   - Yes, that's possible, which means some chocolates may be individually unaffordable.

3. **How should we handle edge cases like if there are no valid pairs?**
   - Return 0 if no such pair exists.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the prices array**:
   - This allows us to use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the required pair.

2. **Use two pointers to scan for pairs**:
   - Start with one pointer at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the sorted array.
   - Depending on the sum of the paired elements, move the pointers inward and adjust to find the optimal valid pair.
  
3. **Keep track of the maximum sum found**:
   - At each step, compare the current valid pair sum and update the maximum sum if it's within the budget and higher than any previously found sum.

### Pseudocode:
- Sort the prices array.
- Initialize two pointers and a variable to track the maximum valid sum.
- Move pointers based on the sum of their pointed values until they meet.

## Code

```javascript
function buyTwoChocolates(prices, budget) {
    prices.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = prices.length - 1;
    let maxSum = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        const sum = prices[left] + prices[right];
        
        if (sum <= budget) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(buyTwoChocolates([1, 2, 3, 4], 5));  // Output: 5
console.log(buyTwoChocolates([1, 3, 6, 2, 5], 8));  // Output: 7
console.log(buyTwoChocolates([10, 20, 30], 15));  // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the prices array.
- **Two-pointer search**: O(n), as each pointer will traverse the array at most once.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
