[Leetcode 1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1889)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an array `packages` representing the sizes of packages you have to ship, and an array `boxes` where `boxes[i]` is a list of box sizes available at warehouse `i`.

The packages must be shipped in some order by the available boxes, and each package must be shipped in exactly one box. A package can only be shipped in a box that can contain it (i.e., box size >= package size).

The space wasted when using a box is defined as the difference between the size of the box and the size of the package. The total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted in all the shipments.

Return the minimum total space wasted that you can achieve, or -1 if it is impossible to ship all the packages using the provided boxes.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input:
packages = [2,3,5]
boxes = [[4,8], [2,8]]

Output:
6
Explanation:
There are two sets of boxes available:
- In the first warehouse, you can choose boxes 4 and 8.
- In the second warehouse, you can choose boxes 2 and 8.
The minimum wasted space is by choosing the second warehouse:
- The first package (2) fits in the box of size 2 (wasted space = 0)
- The second package (3) fits in the box of size 8 (wasted space = 5)
- The third package (5) fits in the box of size 8 (wasted space = 3)
- Total wasted space = 0 + 5 + 3 = 8
Note that the first warehouse also offers a total wasted space of 6, but we return the minimum one.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can each box only be used once?
   - No. Each box size can be used multiple times unless explicitly stated otherwise.
2. Can packages be split between boxes?
   - No. Each package must be placed in a single box that can contain it.
3. Are the package sizes and box sizes always positive integers?
   - Yes.

## Strategy:
1. **Sort the packages** and each list of boxes to enable efficient searching.
2. **Binary Search** can be used to find the smallest box that can contain each package.
3. Iterate through each warehouse's boxes to calculate the total space wasted using that warehouse.
4. Track the minimum space wasted across all the warehouses.
5. If at least one warehouse can pack all the packages, return the minimum space wasted. Otherwise, return -1.

## Code:
```javascript
const minWastedSpace = function(packages, boxes) {
    packages.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let totalPackagesSize = packages.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p, 0);
    let minWaste = Infinity;
    
    for (let box of boxes) {
        box.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        
        if (box[box.length - 1] < packages[packages.length - 1]) {
            continue; // Skip this set of boxes since the largest box can't fit the largest package.
        }
        
        let waste = 0;
        let previous = 0;
        
        for (let b of box) {
            let index = binarySearch(packages, previous, p => p <= b);
            if (index < 0) {
                index = -index - 1;
            }
            
            waste += (index - previous) * b;
            previous = index;
            
            if (previous === packages.length) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        minWaste = Math.min(minWaste, waste - totalPackagesSize);
    }
    
    return minWaste === Infinity ? -1 : minWaste;
};

const binarySearch = function(arr, start, comp) {
    let low = start, high = arr.length;
    
    while (low < high) {
        let mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2);
        if (comp(arr[mid])) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    return arr[low] ? low : high;
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- Sorting `packages` takes `O(N log N)`.
- Sorting each `boxes[i]` list takes `O(Mi log Mi)` where `Mi` is the length of `boxes[i]`.
- Binary search operations for each package take `O(log N)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(N log N + sum(Mi log Mi) + sum(log N))`, which can be simplified as:
- `O(N log N)` for sorting packages.
- `O(B * M log M)` for sorting all boxes assuming average box length is `M` and `B` is the number of box lists.
- The binary search contributions can be polynomially bounded by the above terms.

In conclusion, the dominant factor would be the sorting operations. Therefore, it will mostly depend on the number of packages and the total number of box sizes across all warehouses.
