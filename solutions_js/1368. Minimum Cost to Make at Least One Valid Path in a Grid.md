[Leetcode 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1368)
## Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` grid. Each cell of the grid represents a direction you can move in. The direction is indicated by numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, where:

- `1` means you can move right,
- `2` means you can move left,
- `3` means you can move down,
- `4` means you can move up.

You can change the direction on a cell (i, j) to any direction cost 1. Return the minimum cost to make at least one valid path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of the grid (m x n)?
2. Can the input grid contain invalid directions (other than 1, 2, 3, 4)?
3. How should we handle empty grids or grids with only one cell?

## Code
Here's the solution using a minimum cost/priority queue approach:

```javascript
var minCost = function(grid) {
    const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const costs = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    
    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: (x) => x[2] });

    // Add initial position with cost 0
    pq.enqueue([0, 0, 0]);
    costs[0][0] = 0;
    
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const [x, y, cost] = pq.dequeue().element;

        // If we've reached the bottom-right corner, return the cost
        if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1) {
            return cost;
        }
        
        // Traverse all possible directions
        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            const nx = x + directions[i][0];
            const ny = y + directions[i][1];
            const newCost = cost + (grid[x][y] === i + 1 ? 0 : 1);

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && newCost < costs[nx][ny]) {
                costs[nx][ny] = newCost;
                pq.enqueue([nx, ny, newCost]);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Priority Queue/BFS**: Use a priority queue to explore the least costly paths first. Elements in the queue will be tuples representing the coordinates (x, y) and the current path cost.
2. **Direction Mapping**: Map the directions to indices and their respective moves.
3. **Cost Calculation**: While exploring each cell, calculate if the movement matches the direction of that cell. If yes, no additional cost is added; otherwise, add a cost of 1.
4. **Grid Traversal**: Traverse the grid using the priority queue ensuring the least cost paths are considered first. Update the cost map when a cheaper path to a cell is found.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n * log(m * n))`:
- `m * n` to ensure every cell in the grid is processed.
- `log(m * n)` due to the operations on the priority queue.

This approach ensures we explore the grid efficiently while maintaining a minimized cost to reach the target cell.
