[Leetcode 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1552)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `position` which represents the positions of `n` balls on a number line. You are also given an integer `m` which represents the number of balls to be placed on the positions such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is as large as possible.

The magnetic force between two balls at positions `x` and `y` is given by `|x - y|` (the absolute difference of their positions).

You need to return the maximum possible minimum magnetic force between any two of the `m` balls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Ball Positions**: Are the positions in the array guaranteed to be sorted, or should we sort them?
    - **Clarification**: We must ensure the positions are sorted since the input does not guarantee it.

2. **Feasibility of Placement**: How do we determine if it’s feasible to place `m` balls with at least a given minimum distance between them?
    - **Clarification**: We can use a greedy algorithm to check if placing the balls with a given minimum distance is possible.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a binary search approach on the possible values of the minimum magnetic force:
1. **Sort the Positions**: First, sort the array `position` to simplify the problem.
2. **Define Search Space**: The minimum possible force is 1 (if balls are at adjacent positions), and the maximum possible force is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `position`.
3. **Binary Search**:
    - Use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance.
    - Check feasibility using a greedy algorithm:
        - Start placing the first ball at the first position.
        - For each subsequent ball, place it in the next position that is at least the current minimum distance away from the last placed ball.
        - If you can place all `m` balls with the given distance, it’s feasible.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function maxDistance(position, m) {
    position.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    function canPlaceBalls(minDist) {
        let count = 1;
        let lastPos = position[0];
        
        for (let i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - lastPos >= minDist) {
                count++;
                lastPos = position[i];
                if (count === m) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    let left = 1;
    let right = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];
    let result = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canPlaceBalls(mid)) {
            result = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the `position` array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search on the distance takes \(O(\log d)\), where \(d\) is the range of distances.
3. **Feasibility Check**: Each check involves a single pass through the array, taking \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log d)\), where \(n\) is the number of positions, and \(d\) is the maximum position minus the minimum position.

This solution should be efficient for large input sizes due to the logarithmic factors involved.
