[Leetcode 2395. Find Subarrays With Equal Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2395)
### Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Determine whether there exist **two** subarrays of length `2` with equal sum. Note that the two subarrays must begin at different indices.

Return `true` if these subarrays exist, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a subarray?**
   A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array.

2. **How does the length of `nums` impact the solution?**
   If `nums` has less than 4 elements, it is impossible to have two non-overlapping subarrays of length 2.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?**
   No, there are no specific constraints on the values apart from them being integers.

### Strategy
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find if there are any pairs of subarrays of length 2 with the same sum. 

2. **Brute Force Approach:**
   We could, in theory, check every pair of subarrays of length 2 for equality, but this would be inefficient for large arrays.

3. **Optimized Approach:**
   Instead of comparing sums for every pair of subarrays, we can use a hash set to track the sums of subarrays as we iterate through the array:
   - Calculate the sum of each subarray of length 2.
   - Check if this sum has already been seen.
   - If yes, return `true`.
   - If no, add the sum to a set.
   - If no repeated sum is found, return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function findSubarrays(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 4) {
        return false;  // Less than 4 elements so no two distinct subarrays of length 2 could exist
    }

    let seenSums = new Set();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        let subarraySum = nums[i] + nums[i + 1];
        if (seenSums.has(subarraySum)) {
            return true;
        }
        seenSums.add(subarraySum);
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, since we are storing the sums of subarrays in a set.

This is an efficient solution that ensures we quickly find if such subarrays exist with minimal space overhead.
