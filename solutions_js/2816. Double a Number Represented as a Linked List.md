[Leetcode 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2816)
### Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative number represented as a non-empty singly linked list of digits. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. You need to double the number in-place and return the modified linked list.

For example:
- Input: (1 -> 2 -> 3), which represents the number 123.
- Output: (2 -> 4 -> 6), which represents the doubled number 246.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the input linked list always have at least one node?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, it's a non-empty singly linked list.
  
2. **Will there be any leading zeros in the input linked list?**
   - No, the problem implies a non-negative number without leading zeros in its representation.

3. **Do we need to handle very large numbers?**
   - Yes, but since we are working with a linked list, we don't need to worry about integer overflows in JavaScript.

### Strategy

1. **Reverse the Linked List:**
   - Reversing the list will help us handle the least significant digit first, making it easier to manage carries during the doubling process.
   
2. **Double the Number:**
   - Traverse through the reversed list, doubling each digit and managing carries appropriately.

3. **Reverse the List Back:**
   - After processing, we need to reverse the list back to its original order to return the result.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

var doubleLinkedList = function(head) {
  if (!head) return null;

  // Helper function to reverse a linked list
  function reverse(head) {
    let prev = null, curr = head;
    while (curr) {
      let next = curr.next;
      curr.next = prev;
      prev = curr;
      curr = next;
    }
    return prev;
  }
  
  // Step 1: Reverse the linked list
  head = reverse(head);

  // Step 2: Double the number
  let carry = 0, node = head;
  while (node) {
    let sum = node.val * 2 + carry;
    node.val = sum % 10;
    carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
    if (carry && !node.next) {
      node.next = new ListNode(0);
    }
    node = node.next;
  }

  // Step 3: Reverse the linked list back to its original form
  head = reverse(head);

  return head;
};

// Helper function to create linked list from array
function createLinkedList(arr) {
  const dummy = new ListNode();
  let current = dummy;
  for (const num of arr) {
    current.next = new ListNode(num);
    current = current.next;
  }
  return dummy.next;
}

// Helper function to print linked list
function printLinkedList(head) {
  const result = [];
  while (head) {
    result.push(head.val);
    head = head.next;
  }
  console.log(result.join(' -> '));
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Reversing the Linked List:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Doubling the Number:** O(n), since we need to traverse each node once.
- **Reversing the List Back:** O(n), similar to the first reversal.
  
The total time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, except for the new nodes created if there is a carry at the end, making the space complexity **O(1)** in terms of auxiliary space.
