[Leetcode 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1935)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters` of all distinct letters that are broken on your keyboard. Write a function `canBeTypedWords(text, brokenLetters)` that returns the number of words you can fully type using the broken keyboard.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input sizes?**
   - The length of `text` will be in the range [1, 10^4].
   - The length of `brokenLetters` will be in the range [0, 26].

2. **What should be returned if no letters are broken (i.e., `brokenLetters` is empty)?**
   - If no letters are broken, you can type all the words, so return the total number of words in the text.

3. **Are all characters in `brokenLetters` guaranteed to be lowercase?**
   - Yes, all characters in both `text` and `brokenLetters` are lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Convert `brokenLetters` to a Set**: This will allow for O(1) average-time complexity checks for broken letters.
2. **Split `text` into words**: This allows us to process each word individually.
3. **Check each word**: Iterate over each word and check if any character is in the set of broken letters. 
4. **Count valid words**: Count and return the number of words that can be fully typed without using any broken letters.

### Code

```javascript
var canBeTypedWords = function(text, brokenLetters) {
    // Convert the brokenLetters string into a Set for O(1) lookups
    const brokenSet = new Set(brokenLetters);
    
    // Split the text into individual words
    const words = text.split(' ');
    
    let count = 0;

    // Loop through each word in words
    words.forEach(word => {
        // Check if the word contains any broken letter
        let canType = true;
        for (let char of word) {
            if (brokenSet.has(char)) {
                canType = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        // If no broken letters were found, increment the count
        if (canType) {
            count++;
        }
    });
    
    return count;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(canBeTypedWords("hello world", "ad")); // Output: 1
console.log(canBeTypedWords("leet code", "lt")); // Output: 1
console.log(canBeTypedWords("leet code", "e")); // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Converting `brokenLetters` to a Set**: O(L), where L is the length of the brokenLetters string.
- **Splitting the `text` into words**: O(N), where N is the length of the text string.
- **Processing each word and character check**: O(M * K), where M is the number of words and K is the average length of a word.

**Overall Time Complexity:**
- O(N + M * K), which simplifies approximately to O(N + C), where C is the total number of characters in all words.

**Space Complexity:** 
- O(L) for the Set of broken letters.
- O(M) for the array of words.

This ensures our solution is efficient and optimally solves the problem within the acceptable constraints.
