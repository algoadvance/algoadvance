[Leetcode 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1755)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the absolute difference between the `goal` and the closest sum of any non-empty subsequence of `nums`.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   - The array size can be fairly large, up to 40 elements.

2. **What is the range for the elements in the input array?**
   - The elements in the input array can range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.

3. **Can the subsequence be empty?**
   - No, the problem statement specifies that the subsequence must be non-empty.

4. **Are there any constraints on the solution's time complexity?**
   - Given the constraints, an optimal solution is necessary. This suggests that a brute force solution may be inefficient.

## Strategy
Given that the array can have up to 40 elements, and considering the problem constraints, using a Meet in the Middle approach can be effective here:

1. **Divide the Array**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Generate Sums for Each Half**: Generate all possible sums of subsequences for each half.
3. **Sort and Binary Search**: Sort one of the sets of sums and use binary search to efficiently find the closest sum for each element in the other set of sums.
4. **Calculate Absolute Difference**: For each possible sum combination, compute the absolute difference from the goal, and track the minimum difference.

This approach leverages the combinatorial nature of the sums but reduces the overall complexity using sorting and binary search.

## Code
Here's a JavaScript solution implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function minAbsDifference(nums, goal) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const half = Math.floor(n / 2);

    const getAllSums = (array) => {
        const sums = new Set();
        const len = array.length;
        for (let i = 0; i < (1 << len); i++) {
            let sum = 0;
            for (let j = 0; j < len; j++) {
                if (i & (1 << j)) {
                    sum += array[j];
                }
            }
            sums.add(sum);
        }
        return Array.from(sums);
    };

    const leftSums = getAllSums(nums.slice(0, half));
    const rightSums = getAllSums(nums.slice(half));

    rightSums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDifference = Infinity;

    for (let sum of leftSums) {
        const target = goal - sum;
        // Binary search to find the closest sum in rightSums to `target`.
        let low = 0, high = rightSums.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (rightSums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (low < rightSums.length) {
            minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, Math.abs(target - rightSums[low]));
        }
        if (high >= 0) {
            minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, Math.abs(target - rightSums[high]));
        }
    }

    return minDifference;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Generating Sums**: `O(2^(n/2))` for each half of the array, with `n/2` being the size of each half.
- **Sorting**: `O(2^(n/2) log(2^(n/2)))`, simplifies to `O(2^(n/2) n)` for sorting one of the sum arrays.
- **Binary Search**: `O(n log n)` for each query, since we perform binary search for each element.
  
**Overall Complexity**:
- `O(2^(n/2) * n + 2^(n/2) * log(2^(n/2)))`, which essentially simplifies to `O(2^(n/2) * n)`.

Using this approach ensures that the solution is efficient enough for the given constraints.
