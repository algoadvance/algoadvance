[Leetcode 2171. Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2171)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` integers called `beans`, where each integer represents the number of magic beans in a bag. You are supposed to remove some (possibly zero) beans from each bag such that the total number of beans remaining in all the bags is the same. Your task is to minimize the total number of removed beans.

Return an integer representing the minimum number of beans that must be removed to satisfy the condition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements in the input array non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, all elements represent the number of magic beans in a bag which means they are non-negative integers.

2. **Can the input contain zero?**
   - Yes, some bags might have zero beans.

3. **What should we return when the array length is zero or one?**
   - If the array length is zero or one, there's no need to remove any beans since either there are no beans or the beans are already the same for one bag. The result should be `0`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Sort Array**: Sorting the array will help us calculate how many beans we would need to remove to make the beans in all bags the same as a specific number of beans in a sorted position.
  
2. **Calculate Total Beans**: First, calculate the total number of beans in all bags for easy subtraction later.

3. **Prefix Sum**: Use a prefix sum array that helps keep track of the cumulative sum of beans as we process each possible bean value to retain.

4. **Iterate and Minimize**: For each unique value in the sorted array:
    - Consider the current value as the candidate value for all the beans.
    - Calculate the number of beans needed to be removed if we want all bean counts in the array to be at least this candidate value.
    - Update the minimum number of beans removed accordingly.

### Code

```javascript
var minimumRemoval = function(beans) {
    const n = beans.length;
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) return 0;
    
    beans.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let totalBeans = beans.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    let minRemovals = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const beansAfterRetain = beans[i] * (n - i);
        const removalsIfRetain = totalBeans - beansAfterRetain;
        minRemovals = Math.min(minRemovals, removalsIfRetain);
    }
    
    return minRemovals;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \( O(n \log n) \).
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculating the total sum takes \( O(n) \).
- **Minimum Calculation**: Iterating through the beans to find the minimum removal also takes \( O(n) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \), which is efficient for this problem.
