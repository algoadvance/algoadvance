[Leetcode 2476. Closest Nodes Queries in a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2476)
Sure, let's work through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an array of queries, return an array of the same length where each element is the pair of the closest nodes in the BST for the corresponding query.

For each query `q`:
- Return an array with two elements: the value of the closest node that is less than or equal to `q`, and the value of the closest node that is greater than or equal to `q`.
- If there is no such node, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Datatype and Constraints**:
   - What are the data types for `root` and `queries`?
   - What is the range of values for the nodes in the BST?
   - What is the range of the length of `queries`?
   
2. **Can the BST contain duplicate values?** 
   - Usually, BSTs do not contain duplicate values, but let's confirm.

Assuming:
- The BST nodes contain distinct integer values.
- The BST might be large, and there can be many queries.

### Strategy

1. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - Perform an inorder traversal of the BST to get a sorted list of node values.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each query, use binary search (via the `bisect` module in Python) on the sorted list to find the closest values less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to the query.

### Steps

1. Perform an inorder traversal to get a sorted array of node values.
2. For each query:
   - Use binary search to locate the position where the query would be inserted to maintain sorted order.
   - Determine the closest values less than and greater than the query.

### Code Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
// Helper function to perform an inorder traversal
function inorderTraversal(root, nodes) {
    if (root === null) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root.left, nodes);
    nodes.push(root.val);
    inorderTraversal(root.right, nodes);
}

// Function to find the closest nodes
function closestNodes(root, queries) {
    const nodes = [];
    inorderTraversal(root, nodes);

    const results = [];
    
    for (const q of queries) {
        let lessThanOrEqual = -1;
        let greaterThanOrEqual = -1;
        
        // Binary search for the position
        let left = 0, right = nodes.length - 1;
        
        // Find greater than or equal
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (nodes[mid] >= q) {
                greaterThanOrEqual = nodes[mid];
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        left = 0, right = nodes.length - 1;
        
        // Find less than or equal
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (nodes[mid] <= q) {
                lessThanOrEqual = nodes[mid];
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        results.push([lessThanOrEqual, greaterThanOrEqual]);
    }
    
    return results;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - The helper function `inorderTraversal` recursively traverses the tree in an inorder manner, which ensures the nodes are visited in sorted order.
   - The node values are stored in an array `nodes`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each query, we perform binary search twice:
     - First, to find the smallest node that is greater than or equal to the query.
     - Second, to find the largest node that is less than or equal to the query.
   - These results `lessThanOrEqual` and `greaterThanOrEqual` are combined and added to the results array.

### Time Complexity

- **Inorder Traversal**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the BST.
- **Binary Search**: For each query, it takes \(O(\log n)\). Given \(m\) queries, the total complexity is \(O(m \log n)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n + m \log n)\).

### Summary

This solution effectively combines tree traversal and binary search to efficiently handle multiple queries on the BST. The separation of concerns (traversal and searching) makes the code clear and maintainable while keeping the performance optimal.
