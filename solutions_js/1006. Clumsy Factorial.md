[Leetcode 1006. Clumsy Factorial](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1006)
## Problem Statement
1006. Clumsy Factorial

The `clumsy` function computes a variant of the factorial operation. Instead of the standard `(n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1)`, the operations in the clumsy factorial include multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), addition (`+`), and subtraction (`-`) with the following order of operations for every four elements:

1. Multiply the first two numbers.
2. Integer divide the result by the next number.
3. Add the next number.
4. Subtract subsequent results in such sets.

For example:
- `clumsy(4)` = 4 * 3 / 2 + 1 = 7
- `clumsy(10)` = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1

Implement the `clumsy` function, which takes an integer `N` and returns the clumsy factorial of `N`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `N` always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, `N` is always a positive integer (1 <= N <= 10000).

2. **What should be the result if `N` is 1?**
   - The result should be `1` since there are no other operations to perform.

With these questions clarified, let's move on to the solution.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can:
1. Initialize relevant variables.
2. Iterate through every integer from `N` down to `1` and perform the sequence of operations according to the clumsy factorial logic.
3. Use a stack to manage intermediate results while respecting the order of operations.
4. Perform the final summation/subtraction according to the stack's contents.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} N
 * @return {number}
 */
var clumsy = function(N) {
    if (N === 1) return 1;
    if (N === 2) return 2 * 1;
    if (N === 3) return Math.floor(3 * 2 / 1);

    let stack = [];
    let index = 0;
    stack.push(N);
    N--;

    while (N > 0) {
        if (index % 4 === 0) { // Multiplication
            stack.push(stack.pop() * N);
        } else if (index % 4 === 1) { // Division
            stack.push(Math.floor(stack.pop() / N));
        } else if (index % 4 === 2) { // Addition
            stack.push(N);
        } else { // Subtraction
            stack.push(-N);
        }
        index++;
        N--;
    }

    return stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
};

console.log(clumsy(4));  // 7
console.log(clumsy(10)); // 12
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is `O(N)` because we iterate through each number from `N` down to `1` once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(N)` due to the stack used to store intermediate results.
