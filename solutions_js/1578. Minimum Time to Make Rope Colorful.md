[Leetcode 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1578)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode 1578: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope in a row. You are given a 0-indexed string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i-th` balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Alice needs to remove the `i-th` balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Alice needs to make the rope colorful.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `colors` string and the `neededTime` array have different lengths?
   - No, `colors.length` will always be equal to `neededTime.length` which equals `n`.

2. Are the time values always non-negative integers?
   - Yes, `neededTime` array contains non-negative integers.

3. What should be the output if the input string `colors` is empty?
   - If `colors` is empty, the function should return `0` since there are no balloons to remove.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we can iterate through the `colors` string and use a greedy algorithm to decide which balloons to remove when consecutive balloons are of the same color.

1. Initialize a variable `totalTime` to keep track of the minimum time required.
2. Iterate through the `colors` string.
3. Whenever we encounter two consecutive balloons of the same color (`colors[i] == colors[i-1]`), we need to decide which balloon to remove.
4. Always remove the balloon which has the smaller `neededTime` and add that time to `totalTime`.
5. Continue this process until all consecutive balloons of the same color are handled.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} colors
 * @param {number[]} neededTime
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCost = function(colors, neededTime) {
    if (colors.length === 0) return 0;

    let totalTime = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < colors.length; i++) {
        if (colors[i] === colors[i - 1]) {
            if (neededTime[i] < neededTime[i - 1]) {
                totalTime += neededTime[i];
            } else {
                totalTime += neededTime[i - 1];
                // Swap the current balloon with the previous one for explanation purposes
                neededTime[i - 1] = neededTime[i];
            }
        }
    }

    return totalTime;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `colors` string. We are iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we minimize the total `neededTime` while making the rope colorful by removing the least time-consuming balloons when consecutive colors match.
