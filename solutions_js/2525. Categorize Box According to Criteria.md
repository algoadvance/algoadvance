[Leetcode 2525. Categorize Box According to Criteria](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2525)
### Problem Statement

Given the dimensions and weight of a box, categorize it according to the following criteria:

- A box is categorized as "Bulky" if any of its dimensions is greater than or equal to `10^4`cm or its volume is greater than or equal to `10^9`cm³.
- A box is categorized as "Heavy" if its weight is greater than or equal to `100`kg.
- If a box meets both the "Bulky" and "Heavy" criteria, it is categorized as "Both".
- If a box meets neither of the criteria, it is categorized as "Neither".
- Otherwise, it should be categorized according to the criterion it meets.

Implement a function to determine the category of a given box.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format** - What is the format of the input, and what kind of values can the dimensions and weight take? Are they always positive integers?
   - We'll assume the dimensions and weight are positive integers for simplicity.

2. **Edge cases** - Are there any specific edge cases that need to be handled, such as extremely large values or minimum possible values?
   - We should handle edge cases where dimensions and weight are just below or above threshold values.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Categorize a box according to its dimensions and weight.
 * @param {number} length - The length of the box in cm.
 * @param {number} width - The width of the box in cm.
 * @param {number} height - The height of the box in cm.
 * @param {number} weight - The weight of the box in kg.
 * @return {string} - The category of the box.
 */
function categorizeBox(length, width, height, weight) {
    const BULKY_DIMENSION_THRESHOLD = 10**4;
    const BULKY_VOLUME_THRESHOLD = 10**9;
    const HEAVY_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD = 100;
    
    const isBulky = (
        length >= BULKY_DIMENSION_THRESHOLD ||
        width >= BULKY_DIMENSION_THRESHOLD ||
        height >= BULKY_DIMENSION_THRESHOLD ||
        (length * width * height) >= BULKY_VOLUME_THRESHOLD
    );
    
    const isHeavy = weight >= HEAVY_WEIGHT_THRESHOLD;
    
    if (isBulky && isHeavy) {
        return "Both";
    } else if (isBulky) {
        return "Bulky";
    } else if (isHeavy) {
        return "Heavy";
    } else {
        return "Neither";
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Define thresholds**: 
   - Bulky dimension threshold is `10^4` cm.
   - Bulky volume threshold is `10^9` cm³.
   - Heavy weight threshold is `100` kg.
   
2. **Check bulky criteria**: 
   - Check if any dimension of the box is greater than or equal to `10^4` cm.
   - Compute the volume of the box and check if it is greater than or equal to `10^9` cm³.

3. **Check heavy criteria**: 
   - Simply check if the weight of the box exceeds `100` kg.

4. **Determine category**:
   - If both bulky and heavy criteria are met, return "Both".
   - If only the bulky criterion is met, return "Bulky".
   - If only the heavy criterion is met, return "Heavy".
   - If neither criterion is met, return "Neither".

### Time Complexity

- **Constant time O(1)**: The operations involve only basic arithmetic and logical checks which take constant time regardless of the input size.
