[Leetcode 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2374)
### Problem Statement:
We are given a directed graph represented by an integer array `edges`, where `edges[i]` is the node to which node `i` is connected by a directed edge. We need to find the node with the highest "edge score."

The edge score of a node `k` is defined as the sum of `i` for all nodes `i` where `edges[i] == k`.

Return the node with the highest edge score. If there is a tie, return the smallest node.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the size of the `edges` array?**
   - The length of the `edges` array can be up to \( 10^5 \).
2. **Can `edges` contain cycles?**
   - Yes, the directed graph can contain cycles.
3. **What if the `edges` array is empty?**
   - The problem ensures an `edges` array will always be given, so we don't need to handle the empty case.

### Strategy:
1. **Initialize a score array:** We will use an array or hash map to keep track of the edge scores for each node.
2. **Iterate through the `edges` array:** For each entry `edges[i] = k`, add `i` to the score of node `k`.
3. **Find the max score:** Traverse the score array/map to find the node with the highest score. If there is a tie, choose the smallest node.

### Code:

```javascript
function edgeScore(edges) {
    const n = edges.length;
    const scores = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Add up the scores
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scores[edges[i]] += i;
    }

    // Find the node with the highest score
    let maxScore = 0;
    let bestNode = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (scores[i] > maxScore) {
            maxScore = scores[i];
            bestNode = i;
        }
    }

    return bestNode;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Initialization:** Initializing the `scores` array takes \( O(n) \) time.
2. **Accumulation:** Iterating through the `edges` array to accumulate scores takes \( O(n) \) time.
3. **Finding Max Score:** Iterating through the `scores` array to find the node with the highest score takes \( O(n) \) time.
   
Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(n) \).

### Space Complexity:
1. We use an additional `scores` array of size `n`, so the space complexity is \( O(n) \).

The solution is efficient with a linear time complexity and linear space complexity, which is suitable for the constraints given.
