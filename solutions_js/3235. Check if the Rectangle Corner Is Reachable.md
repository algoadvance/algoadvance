[Leetcode 3235. Check if the Rectangle Corner Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3235)
Certainly! Let's break down the problem-solving process into clear sections.

### Problem Statement

You need to write a function that checks if the corner `(x, y)` in the XY plane is reachable when moving from `(0, 0)` with only moves that increase coordinates or stay in place. A move is considered valid if it keeps you on integer coordinates.

#### Example:
- Input: (x, y)
- Output: `true` if the corner (x, y) is reachable from (0, 0), otherwise `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the actual implementation, we need to clarify a few points:
1. **Nature of Moves**: Are we restricted to a grid-like movement meaning only moves that go to integer coordinates?
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Are negative coordinates valid for (x, y), or are we assuming these points are always non-negative?
3. **Edge Cases**: What are the expected results for trivial cases like (0,0), (0,1), etc.?

Answering these will help tailor the solution effectively.

### Strategy

The task is fundamentally about reaching a particular point in the coordinate grid. From `(0, 0)`, we can reach any point `(x, y)` if and only if:

1. Both x and y are non-negative integers (since moves must keep you on integer coordinates).
2. To ensure that the coordinates we reach can incrementally build up to `(x, y)`, we need to verify a property of numbers regarding their greatest common divisor (GCD).

A point `(x, y)` is reachable from `(0, 0)` if and only if the GCD of `x` and `y` is `1` or at some point during the movement, both coordinates share no common divisor other than 1.

### Strategy Implementation

1. Check if `x` and `y` are non-negative.
2. Compute the GCD of `x` and `y`. If the GCD is 1, the destination `(x, y)` is reachable.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the GCD typically takes `O(log(min(x, y)))` using the Euclidean algorithm. So the time complexity of our solution is `O(log(min(x, y)))`.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

function isReachable(x, y) {
    // Ensure x and y are non-negative integers
    if (x < 0 || y < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check GCD of x and y
    return gcd(x, y) === 1;
}

// Tests
console.log(isReachable(3, 7));  // true
console.log(isReachable(2, 4));  // false
console.log(isReachable(0, 0));  // true
console.log(isReachable(1, 0));  // true
console.log(isReachable(0, 1));  // true
```

### Explanation:
- We've created a helper function `gcd` to compute the Greatest Common Divisor.
- The `isReachable` function first checks if `x` and `y` are non-negative.
- Then, it checks if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, which determines if the target can be reached.

By following this approach, we ensure that the function is both efficient and meets the problem constraints.
