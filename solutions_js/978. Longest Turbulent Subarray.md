[Leetcode 978. Longest Turbulent Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l978)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray `arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j]` is turbulent if and only if:
- For `i <= k < j`:
  - `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and
  - `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is even.

Or,
- For `i <= k < j`:
  - `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and
  - `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is even.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the length of the array `arr`?
   - `1 <= arr.length <= 4 * 10^4`
2. What are the possible values of the integers in `arr`?
   - `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
3. Do we need to return the actual subarray or just the length?
   - We need to return the length of the longest turbulent subarray.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - If `arr` has only one element, the longest turbulent subarray length is 1.
   - Use two pointers (`up` and `down`) to track the difference pattern.
   
2. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse through the array starting from the second element.
   - Use three variables: `increase`, `decrease`, and `max_length`.
   - Update `increase` and `decrease` based on the comparison of current and previous elements.
   - Keep track of `max_length` during the traversal.
   
3. **Comparison of Elements**:
   - If `arr[i] > arr[i-1]`, then current element is part of an 'up' pattern, and update `increase`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, then a 'down' pattern is identified, and update `decrease`.
   - If `arr[i] == arr[i-1]`, reset both `increase` and `decrease` patterns.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the `max_length` found during the traversal.

## Code
```javascript
function maxTurbulenceSize(arr) {
    if (arr.length === 1) return 1;

    let max_length = 1;
    let up = 1, down = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {
            up = down + 1;
            down = 1;
        } else if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
            down = up + 1;
            up = 1;
        } else {
            up = 1;
            down = 1;
        }
        max_length = Math.max(max_length, up, down);
    }
    return max_length;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we simply traverse the array once while updating the variables for the turbulent patterns.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.
