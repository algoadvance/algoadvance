[Leetcode 2451. Odd String Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2451)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 2451: Odd String Difference**

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each string in `words` consists of lowercase English letters. Define the *odd difference* of two strings `A` and `B` of equal length as the sum of the ASCII differences of the characters at odd positions (positions are indexed from 1).

For example, if `A = "abcd"` and `B = "pqrs"`, the odd difference is calculated as:
- The ASCII difference at position 1: `|a - p|`
- The ASCII difference at position 3: `|c - r|`
So, the *odd difference* is `|a - p| + |c - r|`.

You need to find all pairs of different strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` (where `i < j`) from the array `words` that have the same *odd difference*, and return the *minimum* difference found.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Odd Positions**: Are odd positions referring to the 1-based index or 0-based index?
    - Odd positions are referring to 1-based index.

2. **Output Requirement**: What if there are no pairs with the same odd difference?
    - If there are no pairs with the same odd difference, the function should return `-1`.

3. **String Constraints**: Is it guaranteed that all strings in the array are of the same length?
    - Yes, it's guaranteed that all strings in the array `words` are of the same length.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Odd Difference**: For each pair of strings, calculate their odd difference.
2. **Track Minimum Difference**: Use a dictionary to track the lowest odd difference.
3. **Output the Result**: Return the minimum odd difference found in the dictionary, or `-1` if no such pair exists.

### Code

```javascript
var oddStringDifference = function(words) {
    // Convert a string into its odd-index ASCII values
    const getOddValues = (str) => {
        let result = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            if ((i + 1) % 2 !== 0) {
                result.push(str.charCodeAt(i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    };
    
    let minDifference = Infinity;
    let map = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
            // Get the odd values for words[i] and words[j]
            let oddValues1 = getOddValues(words[i]);
            let oddValues2 = getOddValues(words[j]);
            
            // Calculate the odd difference
            let currentDifference = 0;
            for (let k = 0; k < oddValues1.length; k++) {
                currentDifference += Math.abs(oddValues1[k] - oddValues2[k]);
            }
            
            // Check if we have encountered this difference before
            if (map.has(currentDifference)) {
                minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, currentDifference);
            } else {
                map.set(currentDifference, true);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return minDifference === Infinity ? -1 : minDifference;
};

// Example usage:
const words = ["abcd", "pqrs", "efgh", "ijkl"];
console.log(oddStringDifference(words)); // Output: The minimum odd difference
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating Odd Values**: Each string has its odd values calculated directly in `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Pairwise Comparison**: We compare every pair of words, which results in `O(m^2)` where `m` is the number of words.
- **Overall Complexity**: This results in time complexity of `O(m^2 * n)`.

This method ensures that we find the minimum odd difference efficiently for the given constraints.
