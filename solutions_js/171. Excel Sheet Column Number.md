[Leetcode 171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l171)
### Problem Statement

The task is to convert a column title as it appears in an Excel sheet to its corresponding column number.

For example:
- "A" -> 1
- "B" -> 2
- "C" -> 3
- ...
- "Z" -> 26
- "AA" -> 27
- "AB" -> 28

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** Are column titles guaranteed to be uppercase?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, they are guaranteed to be uppercase and valid Excel sheet column titles.
   
2. **Edge Cases:** What if the input is a single letter?
   - **Assumption:** Single letters should be handled as indicated in the examples ("A" -> 1, "B" -> 2, etc.).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to understand that each letter corresponds to a position in the alphabet where 'A' is 1, 'B' is 2, ..., and 'Z' is 26. For titles longer than one letter, each subsequent letter represents a higher place value similar to a base-26 number system.

Steps:
1. Initialize a variable to store the result (column number).
2. Iterate over each character in the string from left to right.
3. Convert each character to its respective numeric value (e.g., 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2).
4. For each characterâ€™s value, update the result using the formula for base-26 conversion.
5. Return the final result.

### Code

```javascript
function titleToNumber(columnTitle) {
    let result = 0;
    const n = columnTitle.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const charValue = columnTitle.charCodeAt(i) - 64; // 'A' -> 65, so 'A' - 64 -> 1
        result = result * 26 + charValue;
    }

    return result;
}

// Test example cases
console.log(titleToNumber("A")); // Output: 1
console.log(titleToNumber("Z")); // Output: 26
console.log(titleToNumber("AA")); // Output: 27
console.log(titleToNumber("AB")); // Output: 28
console.log(titleToNumber("ZY")); // Output: 701
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we need to iterate over each character of the input string exactly once. The operations within the loop (character conversion and multiplication/addition) are constant time operations.
