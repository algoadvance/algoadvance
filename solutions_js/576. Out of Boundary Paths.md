[Leetcode 576. Out of Boundary Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l576)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are also given an integer `maxMove` denoting the maximum number of moves you can make. 

Your goal is to find the number of paths to move the ball out of the grid boundary. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= startRow < m`
- `0 <= startColumn < n`
- `0 <= maxMove <= 50`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we move in all four directions (up, down, left, right)?
2. Should the modulo operation be applied to every intermediate step or just to the final result?

## Code

```javascript
const findPaths = (m, n, maxMove, startRow, startColumn) => {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    let dp = new Array(maxMove + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(0)));
    dp[0][startRow][startColumn] = 1;
    
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let move = 1; move <= maxMove; move++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i === 0) result = (result + dp[move - 1][i][j]) % MOD;
                if (i === m - 1) result = (result + dp[move - 1][i][j]) % MOD;
                if (j === 0) result = (result + dp[move - 1][i][j]) % MOD;
                if (j === n - 1) result = (result + dp[move - 1][i][j]) % MOD;

                dp[move][i][j] = (
                    (i > 0 ? dp[move - 1][i - 1][j] : 0) +
                    (i < m - 1 ? dp[move - 1][i + 1][j] : 0) +
                    (j > 0 ? dp[move - 1][i][j - 1] : 0) +
                    (j < n - 1 ? dp[move - 1][i][j + 1] : 0)
                ) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to use a 3D DP array where `dp[k][i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` with exactly `k` moves.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize the DP Array**:
    - Create a DP array `dp` of dimensions `(maxMove + 1) x m x n`. Initialize all values to 0.
    - Set `dp[0][startRow][startColumn] = 1` because there's one way to be at the starting point with 0 moves.
    
2. **DP Transitions**:
    - Iterate over the number of moves from 1 to `maxMove`.
    - For each cell `(i, j)` on the grid, calculate the number of ways to reach it using the previous move's results from the 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right).

3. **Update Result**:
    - For each cell on the first and last rows and columns after each move, update the result if the ball moves out of the boundary.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Apply the modulo operation to avoid overflow after every update step.

5. **Return the Result**:
    - Return the final result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(maxMove * m * n)` because we iterate through each move and for each move we iterate through all cells of the grid.

The space complexity is `O(maxMove * m * n)` due to the 3D DP array used to store the results.
