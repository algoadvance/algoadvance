[Leetcode 981. Time Based Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l981)
## Problem Statement

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set(key, value, timestamp_prev)` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns an empty string `""`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Explanation
TimeMap kv;
kv.set("foo", "bar", 1); // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1   
kv.get("foo", 1);        // output "bar"   
kv.get("foo", 3);        // output "bar" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 1 is the closest
kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4 
kv.get("foo", 4);         // output "bar2"
kv.get("foo", 5);         // output "bar2" since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 5 but timestamp 4 is the closest
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of key-value pairs set and retrieve operations will be in the range `[1, 2 * 10^5]`.
- The `timestamp` value is positive and will not exceed 10^7.
- All the string inputs `key` and `value` are non-empty and contain only lowercase English letters.
- The `get` operations will always be called with timestamps not smaller than the timestamps of the preceding `set` operations.

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a specific range for the keys or values?**
   - No, the problem states that all keys and values are non-empty lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Do we need to consider performance for both `set` and `get` operations?**
   - Yes, we need to ensure both operations are efficient given the constraints.

3. **Do we know if keys will appear in the `get` operations only if they've been `set` previously?**
   - Yes, `get` operations will be called with timestamps no smaller than the preceding `set` operations, ensuring the existence of keys.

---

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure:**
   - Use a dictionary (`keyValueStore`) where the key is the `key` and the value is a list of tuples, each containing `(timestamp, value)` sorted by timestamp.
   
2. **`set` Operation:**
   - Simply append the `(timestamp, value)` tuple to the list associated with the key.
   
3. **`get` Operation:**
   - Use binary search to efficiently find the correct value for the given timestamp. Since the list is sorted by timestamp, binary search is optimal.

## Code

```javascript
class TimeMap {
    constructor() {
        this.store = {};
    }

    set(key, value, timestamp) {
        if (!this.store[key]) {
            this.store[key] = [];
        }
        this.store[key].push([timestamp, value]);
    }

    get(key, timestamp) {
        if (!this.store[key]) return "";
        
        const values = this.store[key];
        let left = 0, right = values.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right + 1) / 2);
            if (values[mid][0] <= timestamp) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return values[left][0] <= timestamp ? values[left][1] : "";
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **`set` Operation:**
  - Time Complexity: O(1) amortized, as we are merely appending to the list.
  
- **`get` Operation:**
  - Time Complexity: O(log N), where N is the number of timestamps for the specific key, due to the binary search.

This design ensures efficient setting and getting of values, even with a large number of operations.
