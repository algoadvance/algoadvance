[Leetcode 1403. Minimum Subsequence in Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1403)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums`, you need to find a subsequence of the array such that the sum of its elements is strictly greater than the sum of the elements not included in the subsequence. If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the array.

Return the subsequence sorted in non-increasing order.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
Output: [10,9]

Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
Output: [7,7,6]

Input: nums = [6]
Output: [6]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - No, the array will contain only non-negative integers.
 
2. **Should the subsequence contain unique elements or can they repeat?**
   - The subsequence can contain repeated elements if they are present in the original array.

3. **Is there a specific order in which the subsequence should be returned?**
   - Yes, the subsequence should be sorted in non-increasing order.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array in Non-Increasing Order**: Start by sorting the array in descending order.
2. **Find the Subsequence**: Iterate through the sorted array and keep adding elements to the subsequence until the sum of the subsequence is greater than the sum of the remaining elements.
3. **Return the Result**: Once the condition is satisfied, return the subsequence.

### Code

```javascript
function minSubsequence(nums) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    const totalSum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    let subsequenceSum = 0;
    const subsequence = [];

    // Step 2: Choose the subsequence
    for (let num of nums) {
        subsequence.push(num);
        subsequenceSum += num;

        if (subsequenceSum > totalSum - subsequenceSum) {
            break;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Return the subsequence
    return subsequence;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minSubsequence([4, 3, 10, 9, 8])); // Output: [10, 9]
console.log(minSubsequence([4, 4, 7, 6, 7]));  // Output: [7, 7, 6]
console.log(minSubsequence([6]));             // Output: [6]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the array to form the subsequence takes \(O(n)\).

The total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting operation, which dominates the overall complexity. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) as we store at most \(n\) elements in the subsequence.
