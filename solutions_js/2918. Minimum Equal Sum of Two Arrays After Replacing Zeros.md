[Leetcode 2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2918)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, each of size `n`. Both arrays include some occurrences of zeroes. You are allowed to replace each zero in the arrays with any positive integer such that the sum of the two arrays becomes equal. Find the minimum possible equal sum of the two arrays after replacing the zeroes. If it is not possible to make the sums equal, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size `n` of arrays `arr1` and `arr2`?
   - Let's assume `n` is reasonably small such that a moderate computational approach can be used without hitting time constraints.

2. Are the arrays guaranteed to have at least one zero each?
   - Yes, the problem implies this by stating we can replace zeroes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Initial Sums**: Compute the initial sums of `arr1` and `arr2`.
2. **Count Zeros**: Count the number of zeroes in both arrays.
3. **Calculate Difference**: Compute the difference in sums (`diff = |sum1 - sum2|`), where `sum1` is the sum of `arr1` and `sum2` is the sum of `arr2`.
4. **Check Feasibility**: If one array has more zeroes and the difference is too large to balance even after replacing all zeroes with 1 in one array and `diff` value in the other, it is impossible.
5. **Adjust Arrays**: Replace zeros in such a way to balance the sums. Use the condition that if changing balance exceeds `diff`, then consider minimum possible integers.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumEqualSum(arr1, arr2) {
    let sum1 = 0;
    let sum2 = 0;
    let zeros1 = 0;
    let zeros2 = 0;

    for (let num of arr1) {
        if (num === 0) {
            zeros1++;
        } else {
            sum1 += num;
        }
    }

    for (let num of arr2) {
        if (num === 0) {
            zeros2++;
        } else {
            sum2 += num;
        }
    }

    let diff = Math.abs(sum1 - sum2);

    if (sum1 === sum2) {
        return sum1;
    }
    
    if (sum1 > sum2 && zeros2 === 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    if (sum2 > sum1 && zeros1 === 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    if (sum1 > sum2) {
        // Replace zeros in arr2
        if ((diff - zeros2) > 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        return sum1;
    } else {
        // Replace zeros in arr1
        if ((diff - zeros1) > 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        return sum2;
    }
}

console.log(minimumEqualSum([0, 2, 3], [4, 6, 0])); // Example input to illustrate the implementation
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculations**: Calculate the sums of non-zero elements and count the zeroes in both arrays.
2. **Difference Check**: Calculate the absolute difference between the sums.
3. **Feasibility Check**: If we have more zeroes than the difference required to balance, then it's possible to adjust; otherwise, return -1.
4. **Adjust and Return**: Depending on which array's sum is more, adjust the zeroes in the appropriate array.

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Calculations**: O(n) for calculating sums and counting zeroes.
- **Checking Feasibility and Adjusting**: O(1) as decisions are based on counts.
- **Overall**: O(n) because the main computational complexity is from iterating the arrays once.

This approach ensures that we check feasibility and compute the intended balanced sum efficiently.
