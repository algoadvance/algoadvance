[Leetcode 2982. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2982)
### Problem Statement

We are given a problem to find the longest special substring that occurs thrice in a given string. A substring is defined as special if it appears at least three times in the given string.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start, let's clarify the problem with some potential questions:

1. **Is the input string guaranteed to have at least one substring that appears exactly three times?**
   - No, there might be cases where no substring occurs exactly three times.

2. **What should be returned if no such substring exists?**
   - An empty string should be returned if no substring occurs at least thrice.

3. **Is the input string composed of only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, let's assume the input string consists of only lowercase English letters for simplicity.

4. **What is the expected length range of the input string?**
   - Let's assume the length of the string can be as large as \(10^5\).

### Strategy

We will use a combination of binary search and hashing to efficiently find the longest special substring. The steps are:

1. **Binary Search on Length:**
   - Use binary search to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least three times.

2. **Hashing with Rolling Hash:**
   - For each length in the binary search, use a rolling hash (Rabin-Karp algorithm) to check if there exists a substring of that length that appears at least thrice.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function findLongestSpecialSubstring(s) {
    const n = s.length;

    // Function to check if a substring of given length appears at least thrice.
    function hasTripleSubstring(len) {
        const hash = new Map();
        const base = 31;
        const mod = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Calculate the hash of the first 'len' length substring
        let hashValue = 0;
        let basePower = 1;
        for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            hashValue = (hashValue * base + s.charCodeAt(i) - 97 + 1) % mod;
            if (i < len - 1) basePower = (basePower * base) % mod;
        }
        hash.set(hashValue, 1);

        // Use rolling hash to calculate hash of other substrings of length 'len'
        for (let i = len; i < n; i++) {
            hashValue = (hashValue - (s.charCodeAt(i - len) - 97 + 1) * basePower % mod + mod) % mod;
            hashValue = (hashValue * base + s.charCodeAt(i) - 97 + 1) % mod;

            if (hash.has(hashValue)) {
                hash.set(hashValue, hash.get(hashValue) + 1);
                if (hash.get(hashValue) === 3) return true;
            } else {
                hash.set(hashValue, 1);
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    let left = 1, right = n;
    let resultLength = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (hasTripleSubstring(mid)) {
            resultLength = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    // Finding the actual longest special substring using the result length
    if (resultLength === 0) return "";

    const hash = new Map();
    const base = 31;
    const mod = 1e9 + 7;
    let hashValue = 0;
    let basePower = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < resultLength; i++) {
        hashValue = (hashValue * base + s.charCodeAt(i) - 97 + 1) % mod;
        if (i < resultLength - 1) basePower = (basePower * base) % mod;
    }
    hash.set(hashValue, 1);

    for (let i = resultLength; i < n; i++) {
        hashValue = (hashValue - (s.charCodeAt(i - resultLength) - 97 + 1) * basePower % mod + mod) % mod;
        hashValue = (hashValue * base + s.charCodeAt(i) - 97 + 1) % mod;

        if (hash.has(hashValue)) {
            hash.set(hashValue, hash.get(hashValue) + 1);
            if (hash.get(hashValue) === 3) {
                return s.slice(i - resultLength + 1, i + 1);
            }
        } else {
            hash.set(hashValue, 1);
        }
    }

    return "";
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findLongestSpecialSubstring("banana")); // Expected Output: "ana"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** \(O(\log n)\)
- **Rolling Hash:** For each length during the binary search, calculating hashes takes \(O(n)\)
- **Total Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for large strings around \(10^5\) characters.
