[Leetcode 1656. Design an Ordered Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1656)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `OrderedStream` class that represents a stream of `n` elements in order (from `1` to `n`).

Implement the `OrderedStream` class:

- `OrderedStream(int n)` Constructs the stream that has `n` elements, all initially null (i.e., not injected yet).
- `String[] insert(int idKey, String value)` Inserts the string `value` at the position `idKey` in the stream, then returns the largest possible chunk of currently filled-in values starting from the position pointer.

Example:
```plaintext
OrderedStream os = new OrderedStream(5);
os.insert(3, "ccccc"); // Inserts (3, "ccccc"), returns []
os.insert(1, "aaaaa"); // Inserts (1, "aaaaa"), returns ["aaaaa"]
os.insert(2, "bbbbb"); // Inserts (2, "bbbbb"), returns ["bbbbb", "ccccc"]
os.insert(5, "eeeee"); // Inserts (5, "eeeee"), returns []
os.insert(4, "ddddd"); // Inserts (4, "ddddd"), returns ["ddddd", "eeeee"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Indexing**: Does the `idKey` value start at 1?
   - Yes, the `idKey` value is 1-based.
2. **Output Format**: Should the method `insert` return an array of strings?
   - Yes, it should return the largest possible chunk of currently filled values as an array of strings starting from the pointer.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class OrderedStream {
    constructor(n) {
        this.stream = new Array(n).fill(null);
        this.ptr = 0; // The pointer starts at index 0 because idKeys are 1-based
    }

    insert(idKey, value) {
        this.stream[idKey - 1] = value;
        const result = [];

        // Collect all consecutive non-null strings starting from ptr
        while (this.ptr < this.stream.length && this.stream[this.ptr] !== null) {
            result.push(this.stream[this.ptr]);
            this.ptr++;
        }

        return result;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// let os = new OrderedStream(5);
// console.log(os.insert(3, "ccccc")); // []
// console.log(os.insert(1, "aaaaa")); // ["aaaaa"]
// console.log(os.insert(2, "bbbbb")); // ["aaaaa", "bbbbb", "ccccc"]
// console.log(os.insert(5, "eeeee")); // []
// console.log(os.insert(4, "ddddd")); // ["ddddd", "eeeee"]
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a stream array with `n` null values.
   - Set the pointer (`ptr`) to 0, which points to the next expected position in the insertion order.

2. **Insertion**:
   - Convert the `idKey` to a zero-based index by subtracting 1.
   - Insert the value at the calculated index.
   - If the current pointer position contains a non-null value, start collecting these values from the pointer onward until a null or the end of the array is reached.
   - Return the collected chunk of values.

## Time Complexity
- The insertion operation may take O(n) in the worst case if it collects values up to the end of the array. This generally happens if all preceding values have been previously inserted.
- However, in average scenarios, the complexity would often be much smaller because it will only traverse a small part of the array at each insertion.
