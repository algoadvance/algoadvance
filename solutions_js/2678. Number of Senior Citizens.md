[Leetcode 2678. Number of Senior Citizens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2678)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of customer records representing a group of customers. Each record contains customer attributes, and one of the attributes indicates the customer's age. You need to write a function that counts the number of senior citizens (age 60 or above) from this list of customer records.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: What is the structure of customer records? Are they objects, arrays, or strings?
2. **Output Format**: Should the function return the count as a number?
3. **Age Field**: How is the age represented in the customer records? Is it always a number?
4. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider an empty list of records or invalid age values?

Assuming that:
1. Customer records are provided as an array of objects.
2. Each object has an `age` attribute which is a number.
3. The function should return an integer which is the count of senior citizens.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the list of customer records.
2. Check the `age` attribute of each record.
3. Count records where the `age` is 60 or above.
4. Return the final count.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Array} records - Array of customer records (objects with an age attribute)
 * @return {number} Count of senior citizens
 */
function countSeniorCitizens(records) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let record of records) {
        if (record.age >= 60) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const customers = [
    { name: "Alice", age: 58 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 62 },
    { name: "Charlie", age: 70 },
    { name: "David", age: 45 }
];
console.log(countSeniorCitizens(customers)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of customer records. This is because we are iterating through each record exactly once to check the `age` attribute.

This solution is efficient and should work well for a typical range of input sizes encountered in common scenarios. If further optimizations or handling of edge cases are necessary, additional clarifying questions would help refine the approach.
