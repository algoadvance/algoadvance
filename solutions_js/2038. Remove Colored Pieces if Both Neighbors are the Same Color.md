[Leetcode 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2038)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing colored pieces from a row of colored pieces. Alice can only remove a piece colored 'A' if both neighbors are also colored 'A'. Similarly, Bob can only remove a piece colored 'B' if both neighbors are also colored 'B'. Alice goes first. Given a string `colors` of characters where each character is either 'A' or 'B', return `true` if Alice wins, and `false` if Bob wins.

**Example:**

- **Input:** colors = "AAABABB"
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** Alice removes 'A' after `AAA -> AAABB` -> `AABB`, then Bob cannot make a move.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the length of the string `colors`?
   - **A:** The length of `colors` (|colors|) is in the range [1, 10^5].

2. **Q:** Can the string contain characters other than 'A' and 'B'?
   - **A:** No, the string only contains characters 'A' and 'B'.

3. **Q:** What happens if the string consists of a single character?
   - **A:** Neither Alice nor Bob can make any move, and Alice cannot win because the game cannot proceed.

## Strategy

1. Calculate the number of possible moves for Alice (removing 'A') and Bob (removing 'B').
2. Alice wins if she has more possible moves than Bob.
3. Traverse the string and count sequences of three or more consecutive 'A's or 'B's.
4. For 'AAA', count this as a move for Alice. For 'BBB', count this as a move for Bob.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} colors
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function winnerOfGame(colors) {
    let aliceMoves = 0;
    let bobMoves = 0;
    
    // Traverse the string and look for segments of 'AAA' and 'BBB'
    for (let i = 1; i < colors.length - 1; i++) {
        if (colors[i - 1] === 'A' && colors[i] === 'A' && colors[i + 1] === 'A') {
            aliceMoves++;
        }
        if (colors[i - 1] === 'B' && colors[i] === 'B' && colors[i + 1] === 'B') {
            bobMoves++;
        }
    }
    
    // Alice wins if she has more moves than Bob
    return aliceMoves > bobMoves;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(winnerOfGame("AAABABB")); // Output: true
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `colors`. This is because we traverse the string once to count possible moves for Alice and Bob. 

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a few extra variables to store counts.
