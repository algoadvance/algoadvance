[Leetcode 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l757)
### Problem Statement

You are given two-dimensional integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents all integers from `start_i` to `end_i` inclusively.

A set `S` is called a **hitting set** if every interval in `intervals` has at least two integers in `S`.

Return the size of the smallest possible **hitting set** `S`.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[3,7],[5,7],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: A possible hitting set is {3, 6, 7, 8}
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: A possible hitting set is {2, 3, 4}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the intervals guaranteed to be disjoint or can they overlap?**
   - Intervals can overlap.
2. **What are the constraints on interval values?**
   - The intervals are given such that `1 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^9` and the total number of intervals `1 <= intervals.length <= 3000`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Intervals:** 
   - First, sort the intervals by their end values. If they have the same end value, sort by start values in ascending order. This helps us to process the intervals in such a way that we can maximize the usage of elements near the end of the range when ensuring the hitting set criteria.

2. **Hitting Set Selection:**
   - We will maintain a set `S` and iterate over the sorted intervals.
   - We check the count of elements already in `S` that intersect with the interval from the back (end towards start).
   - If fewer than 2 elements intersect, we add the missing required elements from the end of the interval back towards the start.

3. **Greedy Approach:**
   - For each interval, after sorting, ensure adding the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the condition of having at least two overlapping elements.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number}
 */
var intersectionSizeTwo = function(intervals) {
    // Sort by end first and then start in ascending order
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1] || b[0] - a[0]);

    let result = 0;
    let largest = -1, secondLargest = -1;

    for (let [start, end] of intervals) {
        let count = 0;
        if (start > largest) count++;
        if (start > secondLargest) count++;

        if (count === 2) {
            // Need two new numbers, add end and end-1
            result += 2;
            largest = end;
            secondLargest = end - 1;
        } else if (count === 1) {
            // Need one new number
            result++;
            secondLargest = largest;
            largest = secondLargest === end ? end - 1 : end;
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the intervals:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Iterating through the intervals:** \(O(n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures we find the smallest possible hitting set effectively by leveraging the natural order of interval endpoints to make greedy decisions.
