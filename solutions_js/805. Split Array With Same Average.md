[Leetcode 805. Split Array With Same Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l805)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, there's a need to split the array into two non-empty subset arrays such that the average of the two subsets is the same.

Return `true` if it is possible to split the array into two subsets with the same average, otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements of the array all positive integers?** 
   Yes, the elements are positive integers.
   
2. **Can the two subsets overlap?**
   No, the subsets should be disjoint and cover the entire array.

3. **Can there be multiple solutions, or should I just find one?**
   You just need to return `true` if one valid solution exists.

## Strategy

To achieve this, we need to verify if there is a subset of `nums` such that the average of this subset equals the average of the remaining elements.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Average**:
    - Find the total sum of the array and the average of the array elements.

2. **Quick Return Cases**:
    - If it's impossible to partition, return `false` (for example when the number of elements is less than 2).
    - If there's no combination satisfying the subset properties, return `false`.

3. **Use dp and Property of Average**:
    - Use dynamic programming (DP) to check for a possible subset whose sum matches the criteria concerning the average.
    - Create a combination of subsets with proper size and sum. A valid subset must have an average equal to the array's average.

4. **Optimization**:
    - Use a set to store valid subset sums and their corresponding subset sizes.
    - Iterate through the numbers, updating the set dynamically to account for potential subset sums of different sizes.

## Code

Hereâ€™s a JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var splitArraySameAverage = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    if (n < 2) return false;
    
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    const average = totalSum / n;
    
    // Check all reachable sizes
    const possible = new Set();
    for (let i = 1; i <= Math.floor(n / 2); i++) {
        if (totalSum * i % n === 0) {
            possible.add(i);
        }
    }
    
    if (possible.size === 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill().map(() => new Set());
    dp[0].add(0);
    
    for (const num of nums) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (const sum of dp[j]) {
                dp[j + 1].add(sum + num);
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let size of possible) {
        if (totalSum * size % n === 0) {
            const requiredSum = totalSum * size / n;
            if (dp[size].has(requiredSum)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(splitArraySameAverage([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])); // Output: true
console.log(splitArraySameAverage([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,100])); // Output: false
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N * Total_Sum) where N is the length of the array and Total_Sum is the sum of all elements in the array. This complexity arises due to iterating through all elements and updating subset sums which requires both element count and subset sums' range.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * Total_Sum) for the DP table storing possible sums and the sizes of subsets.

This method ensures efficiency while checking for the possibility of splitting the array into subsets with the same average.
