[Leetcode 1457. Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1457)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree where each node contains a digit from 1 to 9, a path from the root to a node is considered pseudo-palindromic if at most one digit has an odd frequency in the path. Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths from the root node to leaf nodes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the node values?
   - Node values range from 1 to 9.
   
2. What is considered a path in this context?
   - A path is any route from the root node to a leaf node.
   
3. Can the binary tree contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, since node values are digits from 1 to 9, duplicates are possible.

4. What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?
   - Typically, binary tree questions assume a reasonably large number of nodes, but specifics may vary. We will assume it to be large enough for worst-case thinking.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree from the root to each leaf node. During traversal, we will:
1. Keep track of the frequency of each digit in the current path using an array or map.
2. When a leaf node is reached, we will check if the path can be rearranged into a palindrome using the condition that at most one character can have an odd frequency.
3. Utilize backtracking to reset the state when moving back up the tree.

### Code

We'll use an array of size 10 to keep track of digit frequencies (since digits are 1-9) and use backtracking to explore all possible paths.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var pseudoPalindromicPaths = function(root) {
    let count = 0;

    const dfs = (node, pathCount) => {
        if (!node) return;

        // Increment the frequency of the current node's value
        pathCount[node.val]++;

        // If we are at a leaf node, check for pseudo-palindromic path
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            // Check if at most one digit has an odd frequency
            let oddCount = 0;
            for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
                if (pathCount[i] % 2 !== 0) {
                    oddCount++;
                }
            }
            if (oddCount <= 1) {
                count++;
            }
        } else {
            // Continue DFS traversal
            dfs(node.left, pathCount);
            dfs(node.right, pathCount);
        }

        // Backtrack to restore state
        pathCount[node.val]--;
    };

    dfs(root, new Array(10).fill(0));
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Frequency Check for Palindrome**: O(1), since we are only checking an array of fixed size 10.

Overall, the time complexity is O(N), making it efficient even for larger trees.
