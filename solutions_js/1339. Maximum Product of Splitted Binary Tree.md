[Leetcode 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1339)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree where each node contains an integer value. Find the maximum product of the sum of the values of any two subtrees of the original tree. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

A subtree of a binary tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The product of the sum of the values of any two subtrees is the multiplication of their sums.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the tree contain negative values?
   **A:** No, as per assumption, the tree contains only non-negative values.

2. **Q:** How large can the tree be?
   **A:** Constraints are typically up to \(10^4\) nodes.

3. **Q:** What defines a subtree split?
   **A:** A subtree split is defined by removing one edge from the binary tree, thus partitioning the tree into two subtrees.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Total Sum:** 
    - Traverse the tree once to calculate the total sum of all nodes. This helps in easily calculating the sum of any subtree by subtracting its sum from the total sum.

2. **Calculate Subtree Sums:**
    - Use a post-order traversal to calculate the sum of all nodes in each subtree and store these sums.

3. **Maximize Product:**
    - For each subtree sum, calculate the product of the subtree sum and the remaining part of the tree, i.e., (total sum - subtree sum). Keep track of the maximum product found.

4. **Return Result Modulo \(10^9 + 7\)**:
    - Since arithmetic operations might result in large numbers, return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProduct = function(root) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    let totalSum = 0;
    let maxProductResult = 0;

    // Step 1: Calculate the total sum of the tree
    const getTotalSum = (node) => {
        if (!node) return 0;
        totalSum += node.val;
        getTotalSum(node.left);
        getTotalSum(node.right);
    }
    getTotalSum(root);

    // Step 2: Calculate subtree sums and potential max product
    const calculateSubtreeSums = (node) => {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        const leftSum = calculateSubtreeSums(node.left);
        const rightSum = calculateSubtreeSums(node.right);
        const subtreeSum = node.val + leftSum + rightSum;
        
        // Calculate product of the current subtree split
        const product = subtreeSum * (totalSum - subtreeSum);
        maxProductResult = Math.max(maxProductResult, product);
        
        return subtreeSum;
    }
    calculateSubtreeSums(root);

    return maxProductResult % MOD;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **First Traversal (Calculate Total Sum):**
    - This involves visiting each node once, hence \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Second Traversal (Calculate Subtree Sums and Products):**
    - Again, this involves visiting each node once, also \(O(N)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N)\), making this solution efficient for the given problem constraints.

The space complexity is \(O(H)\) due to the recursion stack, where \(H\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), \(H\) can be \(O(N)\), and in the best case (balanced tree), \(H\) is \(O(\log N)\).
