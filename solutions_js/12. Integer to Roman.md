[Leetcode 12. Integer to Roman](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l12)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D, M` with the following values:
```
Symbol       Value
I            1
V            5
X            10
L            50
C            100
D            500
M            1000
```
Roman numerals are usually written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the input integer?
   - The problem usually defines `1 <= num <= 3999`.

2. Should we always expect a valid integer within the range?
   - Yes, we can assume the input will always be within the valid range.

3. Do we need to handle invalid inputs, or inputs outside the specified range?
   - Since the input is guaranteed to be valid and within the specified range, no need to handle invalid inputs.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a greedy approach where we map Roman numerals to their respective integer values and construct the result by iteratively subtracting the largest possible Roman numeral values from the given integer.

1. Start with the integer `num`.
2. Define a list of tuples that map integer values to their corresponding Roman numerals in descending order.
3. Iterate through this list, subtracting the appropriate value from `num` and appending the corresponding Roman numeral to the result string.
4. When `num` is reduced to 0, return the result string.

### Code
Let's implement the solution:

```javascript
function intToRoman(num) {
    const valueMap = [
        [1000, 'M'],
        [900, 'CM'],
        [500, 'D'],
        [400, 'CD'],
        [100, 'C'],
        [90, 'XC'],
        [50, 'L'],
        [40, 'XL'],
        [10, 'X'],
        [9, 'IX'],
        [5, 'V'],
        [4, 'IV'],
        [1, 'I']
    ];

    let result = '';
    
    for (const [value, symbol] of valueMap) {
        while (num >= value) {
            result += symbol;
            num -= value;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(intToRoman(3));    // Output: "III"
console.log(intToRoman(58));   // Output: "LVIII"
console.log(intToRoman(1994)); // Output: "MCMXCIV"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because the number of iterations is dependent on the fixed set of Roman numeral values, not the size of the input value. The number of operations required is bounded by a constant. Each integer from 1 to 3999 will have at most a constant number of subtractions and appends. The space complexity is also O(1) since the output string length has an upper bound.
