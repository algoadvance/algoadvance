[Leetcode 2262. Total Appeal of A String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2262)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in that string.

* For example, the appeal of `"abbca"` is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
* The appeal of a string `s` is the sum of the appeal of all of its substrings. Return the total appeal of `s`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "abbca"
Output: 28
Explanation: 
The following are the substrings of "abbca":
- Substrings with unique characters: "a", "ab", "abb", "abbc", "abbca", "b", "bb", "bbc", "bbca", "b", "bc", "bca", "c", "ca", "a"
Their respective appeals: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1
Sum of appeals: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 28
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the string `s` contain only lowercase English letters? 
    - **Assumption**: Yes, the string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
2. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
    - **Assumption**: The maximum length of `s` is sufficiently small for reasonable performance with O(n^2) solutions but ideally would require efficient optimization.

## Strategy
1. **Naive Solution**: Calculate the appeal of every possible substring:
    - Iterate through all possible substrings and calculate the number of distinct characters.
    - This results in a time complexity of O(n^3), which is impractical for larger strings.

2. **Optimized Solution**:
    - Utilize a more efficient way to calculate the total appeal.
    - Maintain a record of the last seen positions of each character.
    - For each character in the string, calculate its contribution to all substrings ending at that character.
    - Use these calculations to accumulate the total appeal.

## Code
```javascript
function totalAppeal(s) {
    let lastPosition = new Array(26).fill(-1); // Store last positions of characters 'a' to 'z'
    let n = s.length;
    let totalAppeal = 0;
    let currentContribution = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let charIndex = s.charCodeAt(i) - 97; // Calculate index for characters 'a' to 'z'
        
        // Update the contribution of the current character
        currentContribution += (i - lastPosition[charIndex]);
        // Add this contribution to the total appeal
        totalAppeal += currentContribution;
        // Update the last position of the current character
        lastPosition[charIndex] = i;
    }
    
    return totalAppeal;
}

console.log(totalAppeal("abbca")); // Output: 28
```

## Explanation
1. Initialize an array `lastPosition` to keep track of the last seen index of each character ('a' to 'z'), initialized to `-1`.
2. Traverse the string character by character:
    - Calculate how each character contributes to the substrings ending at its position.
    - The formula `(i - lastPosition[charIndex])` determines how many additional substrings include this character (from the last seen position to the current position).
    - Update the `currentContribution` by adding this value and then add `currentContribution` to the `totalAppeal`.
    - Update the last seen position of the current character.

## Time Complexity
- The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we process each character in the string and perform constant-time operations for each character.
