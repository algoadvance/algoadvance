[Leetcode 1520. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1520)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings of `s` that satisfy the following condition:

- The substring contains all occurrences of the characters it contains.

Return the list of such substrings in **ascending order** by their starting index.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   Yes, according to the problem statement.

2. **What is the domain of input characters?**
   The input string consists of only lowercase English letters.

3. **Can the output list contain substrings with just one character?**
   Yes, as long as they contain all occurrences of that character.

4. **If there are multiple valid solutions, what should be considered?**
   Return the solution where the substrings are sorted by their starting indices.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Counting and Boundaries Calculation:**
   - First, identify the first and last occurrence of each character.
   - Use two arrays `left` and `right` to store these boundaries.

2. **Extend Each Character's Boundary:**
   - For each character, attempt to extend its boundaries to ensure all occurrences of the characters inside the current boundary are contained within it.

3. **Sorting and Greedy Selection:**
   - Once boundaries are established, sort the possible substrings by their `right` boundary.
   - Use a greedy approach to select non-overlapping intervals.

4. **Construct Result Based on Selected Boundaries:**
   - Generate the substrings using the final selected intervals and return the result in the required order.

### Code
Here's the JavaScript implementation following the described strategy:

```javascript
var maxNumOfSubstrings = function(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const left = new Array(26).fill(n);
    const right = new Array(26).fill(-1);
    
    // Calculate leftmost and rightmost indices
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const char = s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        left[char] = Math.min(left[char], i);
        right[char] = Math.max(right[char], i);
    }
    
    const intervals = [];
    
    // Find the valid intervals
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (right[i] == -1) continue;
        let start = left[i];
        let end = right[i];
        let valid = true;
        
        // Extend the interval
        for (let j = start; j <= end; j++) {
            const char = s.charCodeAt(j) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
            start = Math.min(start, left[char]);
            end = Math.max(end, right[char]);
            if (j < start || j > end) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (valid) {
            intervals.push([start, end]);
        }
    }
    
    // Sort intervals by their end index
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    const result = [];
    let lastEnd = -1;
    
    // Select non-overlapping intervals
    for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
        if (start > lastEnd) {
            result.push(s.slice(start, end + 1));
            lastEnd = end;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m*log(m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the number of intervals.
  - Calculating the leftmost and rightmost indices: O(n)
  - Sorting the intervals: O(26*log(26)) which simplifies to O(1)
  - Extending the intervals and constructing the result: O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space for fixed size arrays and a few extra variables.
