[Leetcode 2696. Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2696)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can:

- Remove any occurrence of the substring "ab" in the string `s`.

Your task is to repeatedly perform this operation until you can no longer remove any occurrences of the substring "ab". Return the length of the final string after all such operations have been performed. 

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "aababb"`
   Output: 0
   Explanation: We can perform multiple operations:
   - Remove one "ab": "aabb"
   - Remove another "ab": "ab"
   - Remove the last "ab": ""
   The final string is empty, so the length is 0.

2. Input: `s = "abc"`
   Output: 1
   Explanation: We can remove "ab" which leaves us with "c". The length of the final string is 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the string only contain lowercase English letters?
   - Yes.

2. Is the input string guaranteed to have a valid letter only?
   - Yes.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - The length can be from 1 to 1000.

## Strategy

The primary task is to remove all occurrences of the substring "ab" repeatedly. A feasible strategy is to utilize a stack data structure to handle this:

1. Traverse through each character in the string.
2. Push characters onto the stack.
3. Whenever the top of the stack (last character) is 'a' and we encounter 'b', we pop the 'a' from the stack (removing "ab").
4. Continue this until the end of the string.
5. The stack will hold the final string after all possible "ab" substrings have been removed.
6. The length of the stack represents the length of the final string.

## Code
```javascript
function minLengthAfterRemovals(s) {
    let stack = [];

    for (let char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === 'a' && char === 'b') {
            stack.pop();  // Remove 'a' when 'ab' is found
        } else {
            stack.push(char);  // Else, push the character onto the stack
        }
    }

    return stack.length;
}

// Test cases
console.log(minLengthAfterRemovals("aababb")); // Output: 0
console.log(minLengthAfterRemovals("abc"));    // Output: 1
console.log(minLengthAfterRemovals("aaabbbb")); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we are traversing the string once, and stack operations (push and pop) are O(1).

- The space complexity is also **O(n)** because, in the worst case, all characters might get pushed onto the stack (if there are no "ab" pairs).
