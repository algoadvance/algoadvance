[Leetcode 771. Jewels and Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l771)
## Problem Statement

You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S` representing the stones you have. Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

### Example
- Input: `J = "aA"`, `S = "aAAbbbb"`
- Output: `3`

### Note
- `J` and `S` will consist of letters and have length at most 50.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the characters in `J` and `S` other than alphabetic and case-sensitive?
   - No, the problem statement already ensures that the characters are letters and case-sensitive.
   
2. Should the solution be optimized for time or space complexity?
   - Given the constraints (length at most 50 for both strings), a straightforward solution that is easy to understand and implement will be sufficient.

## Strategy
1. **Create a Set from `J`:** Since the characters in `J` are distinct, converting `J` into a set will allow for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
2. **Iterate Over `S`:** For each character in `S`, check if it exists in the set derived from `J`.
3. **Count the Matches:** Maintain a count of how many characters in `S` are also in the set from `J`.

## Code

```javascript
var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
    // Create a Set from the string J to allow O(1) lookups
    const jewelSet = new Set(J);
    
    // Initialize a counter for jewels found in S
    let jewelCount = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each character in S
    for (let stone of S) {
        // If the stone is in the jewelSet, increment the count
        if (jewelSet.has(stone)) {
            jewelCount += 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the total count of jewels found in S
    return jewelCount;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of string `S`. Creating the set from `J` is O(m) where `m` is the length of `J`. Given that both `m` and `n` are at most 50, the approach is efficient.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) where `m` is the length of the string `J` due to the set storage. This is space-efficient given the problem constraints.

This solution efficiently counts the number of jewel stones present in the given collection of stones.
