[Leetcode 1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1768)
### Problem Statement:

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
```

Example 3:
```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: What is the maximum length of the input strings `word1` and `word2`?
   - **A**: The inputs can be assumed to have lengths up to 100 characters.

2. **Q**: Can the input strings be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, either or both of the input strings can be empty.

3. **Q**: Are the input strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - **A**: Yes, the input strings will only contain lowercase English letters.

### Code:

```javascript
function mergeAlternately(word1, word2) {
    let merged = '';
    let i = 0;

    // Loop until the end of either word1 or word2
    while (i < word1.length || i < word2.length) {
        if (i < word1.length) {
            merged += word1[i];
        }
        if (i < word2.length) {
            merged += word2[i];
        }
        i++;
    }

    return merged;
}

// Test cases
console.log(mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr"));  // apbqcr
console.log(mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs"));  // apbqrs
console.log(mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq"));  // apbqcd
```

### Strategy:

1. **Initialize an empty string `merged`** to store the result.
2. **Use a pointer `i`** that starts at 0. This pointer will help traverse both strings.
3. **Loop through the strings** using the pointer `i` until the end of either string is reached:
   - **Check if `i` is within the bounds of `word1`.** If it is, append `word1[i]` to `merged`.
   - **Check if `i` is within the bounds of `word2`.** If it is, append `word2[i]` to `merged`.
   - **Increment the pointer `i`** by 1.
4. **Return the `merged` string** after the loop completes.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the sum of the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. The loop iterates through each character of `word1` and `word2` exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space for storing and manipulating the resultant string (excluding the space needed for input and output).
