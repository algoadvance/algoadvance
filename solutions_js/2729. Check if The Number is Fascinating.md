[Leetcode 2729. Check if The Number is Fascinating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2729)
# Problem Statement

A number is considered fascinating if after concatenating it with its multiple of 2 and 3, the resulting number contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. For example, 192 is a fascinating number because concatenating 192, 384 (2 * 192), and 576 (3 * 192) gives 192384576, which contains each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Write a function to determine whether a given number is a fascinating number.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the inputs always positive integers?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input number?**
   - The input number will fit within the standard range of integer values in JavaScript.

3. **Do we need to handle invalid input (non-integer, negative, etc.)?**
   - No, we can assume valid input as per problem statement constraints.

# Code

```javascript
function isFascinating(num) {
    // Convert the number to a string
    const baseStr = num.toString();
    
    // Calculate 2 * num and 3 * num
    const twiceStr = (2 * num).toString();
    const thriceStr = (3 * num).toString();
    
    // Concatenate all three strings
    const concatenatedStr = baseStr + twiceStr + thriceStr;

    // Check if the concatenated string has all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once
    if (concatenatedStr.length !== 9) {
        return false;
    }

    // Create a set of the concatenated string's characters
    const digitSet = new Set(concatenatedStr);

    // Check if the set contains exactly digits '1' to '9'
    for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        if (!digitSet.has(i.toString())) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
# Strategy

1. Convert the number to a string so it can be concatenated easily.
2. Calculate the number's multiples 2 and 3, convert them to strings as well.
3. Concatenate the original number string with its multiples.
4. Check if the resultant concatenated string has a length of 9.
5. Use a Set to ensure all digits from 1 to 9 are present exactly once in the concatenated string.

# Time Complexity

- **O(1)**: The operations involved (string concatenations, set operations, and fixed-length loops) are constant time.
