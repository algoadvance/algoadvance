[Leetcode 1900. The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1900)
### Problem Statement
You are given the integers `n`, `firstPlayer`, and `secondPlayer`. There are `n` players in a competition, where: 
- The players are identified by integers from `1` to `n`.
- Each player plays exactly one match each round against another player.
- The winners of each round proceed to the next round, while the losers are eliminated.

In each round, the players compete with each other in pairs. The ordering of the players for the first round is given as `1, 2, …, n`. Players compete in pairs `(1,2), (3,4), …, (n-1, n)` until there is only one winner. The winners of each pair proceed to form the next round.

You need to find the earliest and the latest rounds in which the `firstPlayer` and the `secondPlayer` compete against each other.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed with a solution, let’s clarify a few points:
1. Do `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` compete in the first round or can they only meet in the subsequent rounds?
2. Should we assume players re-align in each round based on winners?
3. Can n be an odd number or should we assume even numbers always?

### Strategy
1. **Simulation Approach**: 
   - Simulate each round where players compete pairwise.
   - Track the progression of `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer`.
   - Determine the rounds where they meet for the first time (earliest) and last time (latest).

2. **Representation of Rounds**:
   - Use a recursive function or an iterative approach where in each recursion/iteration, pairs advance to the next round until either the `firstPlayer` meets `secondPlayer`, or there is only one player remaining.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function earliestAndLatest(n, firstPlayer, secondPlayer) {
    const dp = new Map();

    function getRound(round, playerLeft, playerRight) {
        if (playerLeft > playerRight) [playerLeft, playerRight] = [playerRight, playerLeft];
        const key = `${round},${playerLeft},${playerRight}`;
        if (dp.has(key)) {
            return dp.get(key);
        }
        if (firstPlayer <= playerLeft && secondPlayer >= playerRight || firstPlayer === playerRight && secondPlayer === playerLeft) {
            return [round, round];
        }

        const nextRound = [];
        const length = (n + 1) >> 1;
        for (let i = 1; i <= (n >> 1); i++) {
            if (i === firstPlayer || (n - i + 1) === firstPlayer) continue;
            if (i === secondPlayer || (n - i + 1) === secondPlayer) continue;
            nextRound.push(i);
        }
        let newLeft = 0, newRight = nextRound.length - 1;
        for (let i = 0; i <= (length - 1); i++) {
            if (newLeft <= newRight && (playerLeft === i + 1 || playerLeft === (n - i))) newLeft++;
            if (newLeft <= newRight && (playerRight === i + 1 || playerRight === (n - i))) newRight--;
        }
        if (newLeft > newRight) {
            dp.set(key, getRound(round + 1, nextRound[0], nextRound[newRight - 1]));
            return dp.get(key);
        }

        let minValue = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
        let maxValue = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;

        for (let l = newLeft; l <= newRight; l++) {
            for (let r = newLeft; r <= newRight; r++) {
                const result = getRound(round + 1, nextRound[l], nextRound[r]);
                minValue = Math.min(minValue, result[0]);
                maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, result[1]);
            }
        }
        dp.set(key, [minValue, maxValue]);
        return dp.get(key);
    }

    return getRound(1, firstPlayer, secondPlayer);
}

// Example usage
console.log(earliestAndLatest(11, 2, 4)); // Expected output: [2, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- Simulating each round until meeting condition is `O(log n)`, where `n` is number of players.
- The recursion and memoization help reduce redundant computation making average complexity closer to `O(n log n)`.

The function simulates player advancement per round and efficiently calculates the earliest and latest round where the specified players will compete using memoization to store intermediate results.
