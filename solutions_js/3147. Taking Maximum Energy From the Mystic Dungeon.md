[Leetcode 3147. Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3147)
Sure! Let's start by breaking down the solution step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

You are in a dungeon and you need to collect as much energy as possible. The dungeon can be represented as a 2D grid where each cell has a certain amount of energy. You start from the top-left corner (0,0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner (n-1,m-1). You can only move right or down at any point in time. You need to find the maximum amount of energy that you can collect on your path from the start to the end.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the size of the grid? (e.g., is it always square or can it be rectangular?)
2. Can the cells have negative values indicating traps or obstacles, or are all cell values non-negative?
3. If the grid has negative values, should we avoid them, or can they still be part of the optimal path?

### Example

Given a grid:

```
[
  [5, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 10, 1],
  [1, 2, 1, 1],
  [4, 3, 2, 1]
]
```

The maximum energy path would be to collect 5 -> 3 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. Here's a plan:

1. Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the maximum energy collected to reach cell (i, j).
2. Initialize the starting point `dp[0][0]` with the value of the first cell in the grid.
3. Use nested loops to fill up the `dp` table:
   - For each cell, you can only come from the left or from above (for cells not in the first row or column).
   - The energy collected at cell `dp[i][j]` would be the maximum of the energy collected from the top and left plus the value of the current cell.
4. The value in `dp[n-1][m-1]` will be the maximum energy that can be collected when reaching the end.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxEnergy(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const m = grid[0].length;
    
    // Create a DP array with the same dimensions as the grid
    let dp = Array.from(Array(n), () => Array(m).fill(0));
    
    // Initialize the starting point
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    // Fill the first row
    for (let j = 1; j < m; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
    }
    
    // Fill the first column
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
    }
    
    // Fill in the rest of the dp array
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    // The maximum energy collected is in the bottom-right cell
    return dp[n-1][m-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Filling up the DP table requires iterating through all cells of the grid once.
- Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows and \(m\) is the number of columns in the grid.

This approach ensures that we optimally calculate the maximum energy that can be collected while navigating the dungeon.
