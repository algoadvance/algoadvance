[Leetcode 1324. Print Words Vertically](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1324)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in `s`. Words are returned as a list of strings, complete strings should not have trailing spaces. Pad extra spaces with ' ' (space) when necessary.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format**: Is the input guaranteed to be a single string?
   - Yes, the input is a single string containing words separated by spaces.

2. **Output format**: How should the output look?
   - The output should be a list of strings, where each string represents a vertical slice of the input words.

3. **Edge cases**: Are there any constraints on the input size or content (e.g., empty string, single word, very large input)?
   - The problem does not specify constraints, but we should handle cases like empty strings or strings with only one word.

### Strategy

1. **Split the Input**: Split the input string `s` into individual words.
2. **Find the Max Length**: Determine the maximum length of these words.
3. **Create Output List**: Create a list to hold each vertical result. The number of elements in this list should be equal to the max length of the words.
4. **Build Each Vertical Word**: Iterate through each character position (up to max length), and for each word, if the current position exists, append the character to the corresponding vertical word; otherwise, append a space.
5. **Remove Trailing Spaces**: For each vertical word, remove the trailing spaces to meet the requirement for no unnecessary trailing spaces.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript solution based on the outlined strategy:

```javascript
function printVertically(s) {
    // Step 1: Split the words
    const words = s.split(' '); 

    // Step 2: Find the maximum length of the words
    const maxLength = Math.max(...words.map(word => word.length));

    // Step 3: Initialize an array to hold the vertical words
    const verticalWords = Array.from({ length: maxLength }, () => '');

    // Step 4: Build each vertical word
    for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
        for (let word of words) {
            // Append the character or a space if the character doesn't exist at that position
            if (i < word.length) {
                verticalWords[i] += word[i];
            } else {
                verticalWords[i] += ' ';
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 5: Trim trailing spaces from each vertical word
    return verticalWords.map(line => line.trimEnd());
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the String**: O(n) where n is the length of the string.
- **Finding Max Length**: O(m) where m is the number of words.
- **Building Vertical Words**: O(maxLength * m) where maxLength is the length of the longest word and m is the number of words.
- **Trimming Words**: O(maxLength * m) in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n + m * maxLength), where n is the length of the input string, and m is the number of words.
