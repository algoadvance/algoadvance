[Leetcode 387. First Unique Character in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l387)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input?**
   - The input is a string `s` which consists of lowercase English letters.

2. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the index of the first non-repeating character, or `-1` if there is no such character.

3. **Are there constraints on the length of the string?**
   - Constraints are typical of LeetCode where the length of `s` is `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

4. **Can the string have uppercase letters or special characters?**
   - No, the problem states that the string `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequency of Characters:**
   - Use a hash map to store the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Identify First Unique Character:**
   - Traverse the string a second time, this time to check the hash map for the first character that has a frequency of `1`.

### Code

```javascript
function firstUniqChar(s) {
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    const charCount = {};
    for (let char of s) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Step 2: Identify the first unique character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (charCount[s[i]] === 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // If no unique character found
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string twice, but each traversal is linear in time complexity.
  - The first traversal is to count frequencies.
  - The second traversal is to find the first unique character.

### Space Complexity
- **O(1):** Constant space for the hash map as the size of the character set (lowercase English letters) is fixed and very small (`26`). Therefore, the extra space used does not depend on the input size `n`.

This solution is efficient for large strings due to its linear time complexity and minimal additional space usage.
