[Leetcode 859. Buddy Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l859)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `goal`. You are allowed to swap two letters in `s`. You need to determine if there is a way to make `s` equal to `goal` by performing exactly one swap. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "aaaaaaabc", goal = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings always of equal length?**
   - Since the description implies you can potentially swap to make the strings equal, they must be of equal length.

2. **Can the string contain non-alphabetic characters?**
   - No, both strings consist only of lowercase letters.

3. **What happens if either `s` or `goal` is an empty string?**
   - The problem guarantees that both strings have a length of at least 1.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Check if lengths are equal:**
   - If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different, return `false`.

2. **Check if `s` equals `goal` and has duplicates:**
   - If `s` is already equal to `goal`, we need to determine if there are any duplicate characters in `s` to make a swap possible.

3. **Find differing characters:**
   - Traverse through the strings to identify positions where characters differ.
   - If there are more than 2 mismatches, return `false` because we can only make one swap.
   - If there are exactly 2 differing positions (`i`, `j`), check if swapping `s[i]` and `s[j]` makes `s` equal to `goal`.

## Code

```javascript
function buddyStrings(s, goal) {
    if (s.length !== goal.length) return false;

    if (s === goal) {
        // Check if there is at least one duplicate character
        const set = new Set(s);
        return set.size < s.length;
    }

    const diff = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] !== goal[i]) {
            diff.push(i);
        }
    }

    // There must be exactly two differences
    if (diff.length !== 2) return false;

    const [i, j] = diff;
    return s[i] === goal[j] && s[j] === goal[i];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(buddyStrings("ab", "ba")); // true
console.log(buddyStrings("ab", "ab")); // false
console.log(buddyStrings("aa", "aa")); // true
console.log(buddyStrings("aaaaaaabc", "aaaaaaacb")); // true
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(N)` where `N` is the length of the strings `s` and `goal`, as we are performing constant-time operations while traversing the entire length of the strings. The space complexity is `O(1)` aside from the space used to store the indices of differing characters which at most would be of length 2.
