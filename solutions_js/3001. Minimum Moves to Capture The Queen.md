[Leetcode 3001. Minimum Moves to Capture The Queen](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3001)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 8x8 chessboard represented by a list of strings. Each string represents a row on the board, and each character in the string represents a cell on the board. The board has the following characters:
- 'K' representing the King.
- 'Q' representing the Queen.
- '.' representing an empty cell.

The King can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Your task is to determine the minimum number of moves required for the King to capture the Queen. If capturing the Queen is not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can pieces or empty cells block the King?**
   - In the problem, only one King ('K') and one Queen ('Q') are provided, with all other cells being empty ('.'). There are no other pieces or obstacles.
   
2. **Can the King reach the Queen in any configuration?**
   - We should check any possible arrangement, but assuming an empty board for pathfinding, we should determine if the Queen can be reached.
   
3. **Can the King move off the board?**
   - No, movements must be constrained within the 8x8 grid.

4. **Is it guaranteed there will be exactly one King and one Queen?**
   - Yes. For the problem to be well-defined, we will assume one King and one Queen exist on the board.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use BFS starting from the King's position to find the shortest path to the Queen.
   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - Use a queue to manage the King's potential moves, enqueueing valid moves until either the Queen is reached or all possible moves are exhausted.

2. **Directions**:
   - Define possible movements for the King (8 possible directions) and apply them iteratively.

### Code

```javascript
function minMovesToCaptureQueen(board) {
    const directions = [
        [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
        [0, -1],         [0, 1],
        [1, -1], [1, 0], [1, 1]
    ];
    
    let kingPos, queenPos;
    
    // Locate King and Queen positions
    for(let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        for(let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'K') {
                kingPos = [i, j];
            } else if (board[i][j] === 'Q') {
                queenPos = [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    let queue = [[...kingPos, 0]];
    let visited = Array.from({ length: 8 }, () => Array(8).fill(false));
    visited[kingPos[0]][kingPos[1]] = true;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [x, y, dist] = queue.shift();
        
        if (x === queenPos[0] && y === queenPos[1]) {
            return dist;
        }
        
        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            let nx = x + dx;
            let ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < 8 && ny >= 0 && ny < 8 && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                visited[nx][ny] = true;
                queue.push([nx, ny, dist + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // If King cannot reach Queen
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2)
  - In the worst case, we are exploring each cell of the 8x8 board once, resulting in 64 iterations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2)
  - We are storing information about visited cells and queue for BFS which can grow up to the size of the board.

### Example
```javascript
// Example board:
const board = [
    "........",
    "........",
    "........",
    "....K...",
    "........",
    "........",
    "...Q....",
    "........"
];

console.log(minMovesToCaptureQueen(board)); // Expected output depends on the positions
```

In this example, the king needs 3 moves to capture the queen.

This approach should help you determine the minimum moves required effectively.
