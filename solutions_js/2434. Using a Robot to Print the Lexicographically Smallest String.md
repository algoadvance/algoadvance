[Leetcode 2434. Using a Robot to Print the Lexicographically Smallest String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2434)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are tasked with using a robot to print the lexicographically smallest string possible. The robot can take the following actions:

1. **Move**: Move to the next character in the string `s`.
2. **Push**: Push the current character onto a stack.
3. **Pop**: Pop the top character from the stack and add it to the result string.

Initially, the robot is at the leftmost character of the string `s`. Your aim is to form the lexicographically smallest string by performing any number of actions. 

You must return the smallest string that can be formed by the robot using the operations described.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
     - Assume `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
   - What type of characters does the string `s` contain?
     - The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
   - How should we handle empty strings?
     - Though the constraint ensures the length is at least 1, in theory, an empty string should return an empty string.
  
2. **Return Type**:
    - Should the function return the string directly?
      - Yes, return the smallest lexicographical string directly.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach with the help of a stack:

1. **Track Using a Stack**: We use a stack to hold characters temporarily.
2. **Determine the Smallest Character**: We need to know the smallest character that still remains in the string (or could be moved to the result) at any point. 
3. **Greedy Selection**:
   - For every character in the string, decide whether to push it onto the stack or add it directly to the result.
   - If the current character is smaller than or equal to any character remaining in the stack, we should add it to the result directly; otherwise, consider pushing to the stack.
4. **Pop From Stack**: Pop the characters from the stack and append to the result whenever they are the smallest option among the remaining characters.

### Code

```javascript
function robotWithString(s) {
    let result = '';
    let stack = [];
    
    // To store the frequency of characters remaining in the string.
    let freq = Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let char of s) {
        freq[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    
    for (let char of s) {
        // Decrease frequency of the current character.
        freq[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]--;
        
        // Push current character onto the stack.
        stack.push(char);
        
        // Check if we can pop and add to result.
        while (stack.length > 0) {
            let top = stack[stack.length - 1];
            
            // Find smallest character remaining in string.
            let minRemainingChar = '';
            for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (freq[i] > 0) {
                    minRemainingChar = String.fromCharCode(i + 'a'.charCodeAt(0));
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (top <= minRemainingChar) {
                result += stack.pop();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result + stack.reverse().join('');
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for auxiliary data structures (stack and frequency array).
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed a constant number of times (one push, possibly some pops).

- The overall complexity is efficient for the problem constraints (n up to 10^5).
