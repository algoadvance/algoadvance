[Leetcode 564. Find the Closest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l564)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` represented as a string, return *the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome*. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

Note: The input `n` is a string that represents a non-negative integer with no leading zeros.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we include single-digit numbers?**
   - Yes, single-digit numbers are themselves palindromes. Hence, the closest palindrome in this case would be a straightforward decrement.
   
2. **Could `n` be very large?**
   - Yes, `n` could be large as it is represented as a string, which implies that direct integer operations might not always be feasible or efficient.

3. **What is the intended output if a tie occurs?**
   - If there is a tie between two palindrome candidates, the smaller number should be returned.

## Strategy

To find the closest palindrome, we will:
1. **Generate candidates:** Generate several potential palindromic candidates close to `n`.
   - Construct palindromes by mirroring the first half of the number.
   - Consider edge cases like the smallest and largest possible values that could be close.
   
2. **Compare the candidates:** Calculate the absolute difference between each candidate and the original number and choose the closest one. In the case of ties, choose the smallest candidate in terms of numerical value.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single-digit numbers (returning the decrement except when n = "0").

### Step-by-Step Approach:

Creating palindromic candidates involves:
- Mirroring the first half.
- Considering +/- 1 transformations around the middle part.
- Edge cases (pure decrement like `999` to `999`).

## Code

```javascript
function closestPalindrome(n) {
    let len = n.length;
    
    if(len == 1) return (parseInt(n) - 1).toString(); 

    let candidates = new Set();

    // Helper to create palindrome by mirroring left part
    let getPalindrome = (half, isOdd) => {
        let mirrored = half + half.slice(0, half.length - isOdd).split('').reverse().join('');
        return mirrored;
    }

    let half = n.slice(0, Math.ceil(len / 2));
    let halfNum = parseInt(half);

    // Original palindrome from half
    candidates.add(getPalindrome(half, len % 2));

    // Modifying half and generating candidates
    candidates.add(getPalindrome((halfNum - 1).toString(), len % 2));
    candidates.add(getPalindrome((halfNum + 1).toString(), len % 2));

    // Edge cases where it affects the number of digits.
    candidates.add("1" + "0".repeat(len - 1) + "1");
    candidates.add("9".repeat(len - 1));
    
    candidates.delete(n);

    let originalNum = parseInt(n);
    let closest = null;

    for (let candidate of candidates) {
        let candidateNum = parseInt(candidate);
        if (closest === null || Math.abs(candidateNum - originalNum) < Math.abs(parseInt(closest) - originalNum) ||
            (Math.abs(candidateNum - originalNum) === Math.abs(parseInt(closest) - originalNum) && candidateNum < parseInt(closest))) {
            closest = candidate;
        }
    }
    
    return closest;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Mirroring Part:** O(N), where N is the length of the number string `n`. Most operations involve creating substrings and concatenation.
- **Overall Consideration Set:** We generate a few fixed candidates (typically around 5), so selection among these is a constant operation. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the mirroring and creating candidates, which is O(N).

This code ensures efficient computation while addressing edge cases such as very small numbers and handling ties effectively.
