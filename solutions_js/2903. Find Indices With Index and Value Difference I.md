[Leetcode 2903. Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2903)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. 

Find the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:
- `i != j`
- `|i - j| <= k`
- `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= k`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of inputs:** What are the possible values for `nums` and `k`?
   - You can assume `nums.length` is between `1` and `10^5` and the elements of `nums` are between `-10^4` and `10^4`.
   
2. **Constraints:** Are there any time complexity constraints we should be aware of?
   - Ideally, we want a solution that is efficient enough to handle the maximum input sizes, i.e., an O(n) or O(n log n) solution is preferred.

3. **Output format:** Should the function return the count of such pairs or the actual pairs?
   - The function should return the count of such pairs.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of indices `[i - k, i]` while iterating through the array and count pairs that satisfy the conditions. 

Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize the window:** Start with an empty window.
2. **Traverse the array:** For each element in `nums`:
   - Add the current index to the window.
   - Remove any indices from the window that are out of the range `[i - k, i]`.
   - Count pairs within the window that satisfy `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= k`.
   
3. **Sliding Window Management:** Ensure that the window size does not exceed `k` by removing the oldest elements as necessary.

## Code

```javascript
function countPairs(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    const window = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Remove indices that are out of the current window range
        while (window.length > 0 && window[0] < i - k) {
            window.shift();
        }

        // Count valid pairs in the current window
        for (let j of window) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= k) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Add the current index to the window
        window.push(i);
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Inserting and removing elements from window:** Each index is added and removed from the window at most once, leading to an O(n) complexity.
- **Counting valid pairs within the window:** In the worst case, it takes O(k) operations per element, leading to O(n * k) in total.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n * k)**. This is efficient for small values of `k`, but may not be optimal for very large `k`. If needed, further optimizations such as using more advanced data structures could be explored.

```python
# Testing the implementation
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 1
console.log(countPairs(nums, k));  # Example basic test case
```
