[Leetcode 90. Subsets II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l90)
## Problem Statement

Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

## Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the length of `nums`?
     - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 10.
   - What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
     - Elements of `nums` are between -10 and 10.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the subsets be returned in any specific order?
     - No, subsets can be returned in any order.
   - Is the input already sorted?
     - No, the input may not be sorted, but we can sort it initially if needed.

## Strategy

To generate all possible subsets and ensure there are no duplicate subsets:
1. **Sorting:** First, we sort the input array. This helps to easily skip duplicates.
2. **Backtracking:** Use a backtracking approach to generate subsets.
   - We maintain an intermediate collection (path) to build the current subset.
   - We iterate over the elements, and if it is the same as the previous element, we skip it to avoid creating duplicate subsets.
   - We recursively build subsets with decisions to include or exclude each element.

## Code

```javascript
var subsetsWithDup = function(nums) {
    // Sort the array to handle duplicates easily
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const res = [];
    
    // Helper function for backtracking
    const backtrack = (start, path) => {
        res.push([...path]); // Push current subset to result
        
        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Skip duplicates
            if (i > start && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            // Include the current number and move to the next
            path.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, path);
            path.pop();  // Backtrack
        }
    };
    
    backtrack(0, []);
    return res;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the input:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Generating Subsets:** Each element can either be included or excluded, leading to `2^n` subsets in the worst case.
- **Deduplication Handling:** The actual generation and deduplication should still be approximated as `2^n` given a proper skip of duplicates during the recursive generation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + 2^n)`. However, the exponential component (`2^n`) dominates for larger `n`.

## Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space:** The space used by the recursion stack and the path storage would also be `O(n)`, but storing all subsets will require `O(2^n * n)` considering the worst-case size scenario.

Thus, the space complexity is `O(2^n * n)`.

This solution effectively handles duplicates by skipping them during the subset generation, ensuring all subsets are distinct.
