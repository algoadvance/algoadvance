[Leetcode 2836. Maximize Value of Function in a Ball Passing Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2836)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph representing a ball passing game where `n` players, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, are located at the nodes of the graph. Each directed edge represents a possible pass, and every time a pass is made, a certain value is added to the function. Your task is to maximize the value of this function by defining the sequence of passes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Representation**: Is the graph provided in the form of an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix?
2. **Function Definition**: How exactly is the value of the function calculated when a pass is made? Is it a sum of weights or some other metric?
3. **Pass Sequence Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the sequence of the passes, such as a maximum or minimum number of passes?
4. **Starting Point**: Is there a specified starting node for the ball passing game?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Traversal**: Since we need to maximize the value, exploring all possible paths and their cumulative values might help.
2. **Dynamic Programming or Backtracking**: Use dynamic programming or backtracking to keep track of the maximum value obtained.
3. **Track Passes**: To ensure we don't end up in infinite loops, keep track of nodes already visited in the current path.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity will depend on the traversal technique. For exhaustive traversal, it could be O(V + E), but due to backtracking or memoization, it might increase.

### Example Inputs

For now, let's assume the graph is given as an adjacency list:
```
nodes = 4
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)]
values = [4, 3, -2, 5] // Value gained when each pass is made
```

Let's proceed to build the solution.

### Code

```javascript
const maxBallPassingValue = (numNodes, edges, values) => {
  // Build graph
  const graph = Array.from({ length: numNodes }, () => []);
  edges.forEach(([from, to], index) => {
    graph[from].push({ to, value: values[index] });
  });

  let maxValue = -Infinity;
  
  // Define a function to perform DFS on the graph
  const dfs = (node, currentSum, visited) => {
    maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, currentSum);
    
    for (const { to, value } of graph[node]) {
      if (!visited[to]) {
        visited[to] = true;
        dfs(to, currentSum + value, visited);
        visited[to] = false;
      }
    }
  };

  // Try starting from each node
  for (let start = 0; start < numNodes; start++) {
    const visited = Array(numNodes).fill(false);
    visited[start] = true;
    dfs(start, 0, visited);
  }
  
  return maxValue;
};

// Example Usage
const numNodes = 4;
const edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 0]];
const values = [4, 3, -2, 5];

console.log(maxBallPassingValue(numNodes, edges, values)); // Output example value
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction**: Build an adjacency list from the given edges and values.
2. **DFS**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore all paths starting from each node.
3. **State Tracking**: Use an array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.
4. **Max Value Tracking**: Track the maximum value encountered during traversal.

This solution explores all paths and accumulates the pass values, aiming to find the path yielding the maximum value overall. 

## Time Complexity

The worst-case time complexity would be O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges, but it can vary depending on the graph's structure and connectivity.
