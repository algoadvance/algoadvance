[Leetcode 190. Reverse Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l190)
### Problem Statement

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 00111001011110000010100101000000
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 10111111111111111111111111111111
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
```

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the integerâ€™s internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should I do if the input has more or less than 32 bits?
    - For this problem, the input will always be a valid 32-bit unsigned integer.

### Strategy

1. Initialize the reversed number as 0.
2. Iterate over each bit position from 0 to 31.
3. For each bit in the input integer:
    - Extract the bit at the current position.
    - Shift this bit to its reversed position.
    - Combine the reversed bit with the reversed number using bitwise OR.
4. Return the reversed number.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number} - a positive integer
 */
var reverseBits = function(n) {
    let reversed = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        // Extract the least significant bit of n
        let bit = n & 1;
        // Shift the bit to its new position in the reversed number
        reversed = (reversed << 1) | bit;
        // Shift n right to process the next bit in the next iteration
        n = n >> 1;
    }
    
    return reversed >>> 0;  // Ensure the result is an unsigned 32-bit integer
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(1)**. This is because the loop always runs a fixed number of iterations (32 iterations), and each iteration does a constant amount of work. Therefore, the time complexity is constant.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space for the `reversed` variable and a few other variables.

This should handle reversing bits efficiently for any 32-bit unsigned integer input.
