[Leetcode 554. Brick Wall](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l554)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a list of lists of integers `wall` representing a brick wall. Each list represents a row of bricks in the wall, where the integers represent the lengths of each brick in the row, from left to right.

Find the minimum number of vertical lines that need to be drawn such that every line goes through the fewest bricks.

**Example:**
```
Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],
               [3,1,2],
               [1,3,2],
               [2,4],
               [3,1,2],
               [1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```
**Note:**
- The wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the lengths of the bricks in that row.
- You cannot draw a line at the left or right edge of the wall.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What range can the lengths of the bricks span?**
   - The lengths of the bricks are positive integers.
2. **What is the range in size for the wall?**
   - The wall has at least one row and at least one brick per row.
3. **Can we assume all input values are valid and non-negative?**
   - Yes, all input values are valid and non-negative positive integers.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to find the vertical line that goes through the fewest bricks. We can achieve this by utilizing a hashmap (or dictionary) to record the number of times a particular edge of a brick occurs.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each row in the wall.
2. For each brick in the row, record the cumulative sum of brick lengths up to that point in a hashmap.
3. The key in the hashmap will be the cumulative length, and the value will be the count of how many times this edge appears.
4. Since we cannot cut through the edges at the start or the end of the wall, we do not consider the total length of the row.
5. Find the position (edge) that appears the most frequently.
6. Subtract this frequency from the total number of rows to get the minimum number of bricks that need to be cut.

### Code:
```javascript
var leastBricks = function(wall) {
    let edgeCounts = {};

    for (let row of wall) {
        let edgePosition = 0;
        // Skip the last brick in the row
        for (let i = 0; i < row.length - 1; i++) {
            edgePosition += row[i];
            if (!edgeCounts[edgePosition]) {
                edgeCounts[edgePosition] = 0;
            }
            edgeCounts[edgePosition]++;
        }
    }

    let maxEdges = 0;
    for (let edge in edgeCounts) {
        if (edgeCounts[edge] > maxEdges) {
            maxEdges = edgeCounts[edge];
        }
    }

    return wall.length - maxEdges;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the average number of bricks per row. We iterate through each row and each brick (except the last one in each row) to compute the edge positions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(E), where E is the number of unique edges. In the worst case, we store the count for each unique edge position.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the vertical line that intersects the fewest bricks for a given wall structure.
