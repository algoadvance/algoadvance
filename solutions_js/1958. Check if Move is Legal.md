[Leetcode 1958. Check if Move is Legal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1958)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `board` where the cells are marked as either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied). Players can place their pieces on the board according to the following rule:

To place a piece at position `(row, col)`, the move must:
1. Have the cell initially empty (`board[row][col] == 0`).
2. Place a piece that completes a valid streak of ones such that it captures all opponent pieces between the new piece and an existing piece of yours (same player). 

A streak is a sequence of one or more `1`s (occupied cells) that is bound by `0`s (empty cells) on both sides, or by the edge of the board.

Write a function that checks if a given move is legal.

### Function Signature
```javascript
function checkMove(board, rMove, cMove, color) {
    // ...
}
```

**Input:**
- `board`: a 2D array of integers (`1`s and `0`s) where `1` represents occupied and `0` represents empty.
- `rMove`: the row index where the player wants to place the piece.
- `cMove`: the column index where the player wants to place the piece.
- `color`: the integer representing the player's piece to place (either `1` or `0`).

**Output:**
- Boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating if the move is legal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is `color` in the input only allowed to be `1` (occupied by me) and `0` (occupied by the opponent)?
2. Are there any specific constraints on the size of the board?
3. Are diagonal streaks considered valid as well or is it only horizontal and vertical streaks?

### Strategy

1. **Verify Initial Conditions:**
   - Check if `board[rMove][cMove] == 0`. If it is not, return `false` immediately.
   
2. **Check in all eight possible directions:**
   - Horizontal (left and right)
   - Vertical (up and down)
   - Diagonal (both the primary and secondary diagonals)

3. **Scanning in Each Direction:**
   - For each direction, scan until we hit the edge of the board or a `0`.
   - Check if we encounter exactly one streak that is bounded by the new piece and an existing piece of the same color.
   
4. **Implement Directional Checking Logic:**
   - Develop a helper function to process the linear scans in each direction and another function to check all directions.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) for scanning each direction, and across all eight possible directions is O(8n) which simplifies to O(n).

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function checkMove(board, rMove, cMove, color) {
    const n = board.length;
    
    // Direction vectors for 8 possible directions
    const directions = [
        [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0], // Horizontal and Vertical
        [1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1] // Diagonals
    ];
    
    function isValidDirection(x, y, dx, dy, color) {
        let count = 0;
        // Move in the direction while we are within the bounds
        while (x >= 0 && x < n && y >= 0 && y < n) {
            if (board[x][y] == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            if (board[x][y] == color) {
                return count > 0; // A streak is found
            }
            x += dx;
            y += dy;
            count++;
        }
        return false;
    }

    if (board[rMove][cMove] != 0) {
        return false; // Move is not on an empty cell
    }

    for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
        let x = rMove + dx;
        let y = cMove + dy;
        if (isValidDirection(x, y, dx, dy, color)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

This code will effectively scan the board in all directions starting from the move `rMove`, `cMove` and check if any valid capturing configuration is possible based on the prescribed rules.
