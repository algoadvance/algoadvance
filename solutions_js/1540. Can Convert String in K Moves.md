[Leetcode 1540. Can Convert String in K Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1540)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `k`. You can convert `s` to `t` by performing exactly `k` moves. In each move, you can increment a character in `s` (i.e., change `s[i]` to `s[i] + 1`). You are allowed to wrap around the alphabet such that `z` becomes `a`.

The task is to determine if you can transform `s` into `t` in exactly `k` moves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the strings `s` and `t`?
   
   **Answer:** Each string can be up to `10^5` characters long.

2. **Moves Allowed:**
   - What does it mean to wrap around the alphabet?

   **Answer:** It means that incrementing from 'z' results in 'a'. For instance, 'z' + 1 = 'a'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Will `k` always be sufficient to transform `s` into `t`?

   **Answer:** No, it is possible that `k` is not sufficient. This needs to be checked in the solution.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the difference for each character in `s` to the corresponding character in `t`. This includes wrapping around: difference = (t[i] - s[i]) % 26.
2. Track how many moves are possible for each 'distance' using a frequency map while abiding by the rules of move counts and increments.
3. Determine the minimum moves required for changes of each specific distance (0 to 25).
4. Check if the accumulated minimum moves match `k` and if they stay within `k`.

### Code
```javascript
function canConvertString(s, t, k) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
    
    const n = s.length;
    const maxCharIncrement = 26; // As there are 26 letters in the alphabet
    const counts = new Array(maxCharIncrement).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const dif = (t.charCodeAt(i) - s.charCodeAt(i) + maxCharIncrement) % maxCharIncrement;
        counts[dif]++;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < maxCharIncrement; i++) {
        const maxMovesNeededForDif = i + (counts[i] - 1) * maxCharIncrement;
        if (maxMovesNeededForDif > k) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(canConvertString("input", "ouput", 9));  // false
console.log(canConvertString("abc", "bcd", 10));    // true
console.log(canConvertString("aab", "bbb", 27));    // true
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The solution goes through the strings and processes each character pair in O(n) time. The frequency count and final check are both O(1) operations, since we're dealing with a fixed number (26 alphabets). Thus, the overall complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity:** We use an array of fixed size 26 to store the frequency count, hence the space complexity is **O(1)**.
