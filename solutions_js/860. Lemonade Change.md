[Leetcode 860. Lemonade Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l860)
### Problem Statement

The problem is about managing change in a lemonade stand. Here's the problem statement:

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and each customer only buys one lemonade and pays with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide each customer with the correct change, if possible. Initially, you start with no change. Return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the denominations of bills that the customers can use?**
   - Customers can use $5, $10, or $20 bills.

2. **Do we start with any initial change?**
   - No, you start with no initial change.

3. **What should we return if it's not possible to provide the correct change to even a single customer?**
   - Return `false`.

4. **What should we consider as our 'cash register' for calculating available change?**
   - You can use counters for $5 and $10 bills to keep track of the available change.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Maintain two counters for the number of $5 and $10 bills you have.

2. **Iterate through the Customers:**
   - For each transaction, determine the bill the customer gives.
   - If it's $5, just increment your $5 counter.
   - If it's $10, you need to give back $5 if possible and decrement the $5 counter if you do so.
   - If it's $20, prioritize giving one $10 and one $5 bill as change. If that's not possible, try giving three $5 bills. If neither is possible, return `false`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Insufficient change to give to a customer.
   - Handling the first transaction should always be straightforward since the customer will always give you a $5 bill (as there's no other option to give change initially).

### Code

```javascript
var lemonadeChange = function(bills) {
    let fiveDollarBills = 0;
    let tenDollarBills = 0;

    for (let bill of bills) {
        if (bill === 5) {
            fiveDollarBills += 1;
        } else if (bill === 10) {
            if (fiveDollarBills === 0) {
                return false;
            }
            fiveDollarBills -= 1;
            tenDollarBills += 1;
        } else if (bill === 20) {
            if (tenDollarBills > 0 && fiveDollarBills > 0) {
                tenDollarBills -= 1;
                fiveDollarBills -= 1;
            } else if (fiveDollarBills >= 3) {
                fiveDollarBills -= 3;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of customers (or number of transactions). 

This is because we are iterating through the list of bills once and performing constant time checks and operations for each bill. Therefore, the solution is efficient and works within the limits of typical constraints.
