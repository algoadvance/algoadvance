[Leetcode 1576. Replace All ?'s to Avoid Consecutive Repeating Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1576)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` that contains only lowercase English letters and the `'?'` character. Replace all the `'?'` characters, so that the final string does not contain any consecutive repeating characters. You need to return the final string. It is guaranteed the solution is always possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be multiple '?' in a row?**
   - Yes, there can be multiple consecutive '?' in the input string.
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The problem generally assumes typical constraints common to competitive programming problems, such as `1 <= s.length <= 1000`.
3. **Do we need to use the same character for all '?' replacements?**
   - No, you can use different characters for each `?` as long as no two consecutive characters are the same in the final string.

### Strategy
1. Loop through each character in the string.
2. If the character is `?`, replace it with a character that is not equal to the previous or next character.
3. Use a character replacement function to find a suitable replacement.
4. Construct the final string with all replacements in place.

### Code Implementation
```javascript
function replaceQuestionMarks(s) {
    // Convert the string to an array to easily modify characters
    let chars = s.split('');
    
    // Helper function to get a non-repeating character
    function getNonRepeatingChar(prev, next) {
        let options = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
        for (let char of options) {
            if (char !== prev && char !== next) {
                return char;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Iterate over the array and replace '?' with the appropriate character
    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        if (chars[i] === '?') {
            let prev = (i > 0) ? chars[i - 1] : '';
            let next = (i < chars.length - 1) ? chars[i + 1] : '';
            chars[i] = getNonRepeatingChar(prev, next);
        }
    }
    
    // Convert the array back to a string and return it
    return chars.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(replaceQuestionMarks("ab?ac?")); // Possible output: "abaacb"
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The function iterates through the string once, replacing each `?` with a suitable character. The helper function checks at most three characters each time, which is constant time work, making the overall time complexity linear in terms of the length of the string `n`.
