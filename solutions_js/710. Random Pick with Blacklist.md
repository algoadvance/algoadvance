[Leetcode 710. Random Pick with Blacklist](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l710)
## Problem Statement:

Given a blacklist `B` containing unique integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, write a function to generate a list of indices while avoiding these blacklisted numbers.

- `Solution(n, blacklist)` initializes the object with parameters `n` and the blacklist `B`.
- The function `pick()` returns a random integer within the range `[0, n-1]` inclusive, ensuring it is not in the blacklist `B`. Each integer should be equally likely to be returned.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the blacklist be empty?**
   - Yes, in that case, any integer `0` to `n-1` can be returned.

2. **Can n be 0 or 1?**
   - `n` can be 1 but should be greater than or equal to the length of the blacklist, ensuring some valid integer is present.

3. **Do we need to optimize for speed in the `pick()` method?**
   - Yes, using a direct map to offset the elements efficiently would optimize the solution rather than repeatedly generating and checking random numbers.

## Strategy:

1. Use a dictionary to map blacklisted numbers below `n - len(blacklist)` to valid non-blacklisted numbers.
2. Generate a `whitelist_size` as `n - len(blacklist)`.
3. When picking, randomly select any number in the range from `0` to `whitelist_size - 1`.
4. If that number is in the dictionary, it means it's mapped to a non-blacklisted number and needs conversion.
5. Otherwise, stick with the random number generated.

By doing this, we make sure all picked numbers are valid and the `pick()` function runs in constant time.

## Code:

```javascript
class Solution {
    constructor(n, blacklist) {
        this.blacklistSet = new Set(blacklist);
        this.mapping = {};
        this.whitelistSize = n - blacklist.length;

        let last = n - 1;
        
        for (let b of blacklist) {
            if (b < this.whitelistSize) {
                while (this.blacklistSet.has(last)) {
                    last--;
                }
                this.mapping[b] = last;
                last--;
            }
        }
    }
  
    pick() {
        let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.whitelistSize);
        return this.mapping[randomNum] || randomNum;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// const solution = new Solution(10, [1, 2, 3]);
// console.log(solution.pick()); // Random number from {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Initialization Time Complexity:** `O(B)` where `B` is the size of the blacklist. This is due to iterating over the blacklist to create the mapping.
- **Pick Time Complexity:** `O(1)` since picking and mapping (or returning the untouched number) are both constant-time operations.
