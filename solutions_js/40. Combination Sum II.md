[Leetcode 40. Combination Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l40)
## Problem Statement:
Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in the combination.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Example:
**Input:** `candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5]`, `target = 8`

**Output:** `[[1,1,6], [1,2,5], [1,7], [2,6]]`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a list of lists, where each list contains a series of numbers summing up to `target`.

2. **Should the candidates array be sorted?**
   - Sorting can simplify the problem, making it easier to skip duplicates.

3. **Are there negative numbers in the input?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but typically candidates are non-negative integers.

4. **How should I handle duplicate combinations in the output?**
   - Ensure that the solution set does not contain duplicate combinations.

## Strategy:

1. **Sort the Candidates:**
   - Sort the candidates array to handle duplicates easily.
   
2. **Backtracking:**
   - Use backtracking to find all possible combinations. 
   - At each step, choose a candidate, explore further with the reduced target, and backtrack.

3. **Skip Duplicates:**
   - While choosing the next candidate, skip the duplicates to avoid duplicate combinations in the result.

## Time Complexity:
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `candidates`.
- **Backtracking:** Based on how many combinations we explore, can be exponential in the worst case, often approximated as `O(2^n)`, because for each element, we have two choices (include or exclude).

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} candidates
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var combinationSum2 = function(candidates, target) {
    candidates.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sort the array to handle duplicates easily
    let results = [];
    
    const backtrack = (start, target, path) => {
        if (target === 0) {
            results.push([...path]);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            // Skip duplicates
            if (i > start && candidates[i] === candidates[i - 1]) continue;
            
            // If the current element is greater than target, we can break the loop
            if (candidates[i] > target) break;
            
            path.push(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, target - candidates[i], path);
            path.pop(); // backtrack
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(0, target, []);
    return results;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(combinationSum2([10,1,2,7,6,1,5], 8));
// Output: [[1,1,6], [1,2,5], [1,7], [2,6]]
```

In this solution:
1. **Sorting** helps to manage duplicate candidates and efficiently skip them.
2. **Backtracking** explores all potential combinations, pruning the path when the sum exceeds the target or when a duplicate is found.

By following this strategy, the problem is efficiently solved while ensuring uniqueness in the result set.
