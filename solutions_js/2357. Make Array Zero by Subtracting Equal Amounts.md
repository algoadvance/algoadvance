[Leetcode 2357. Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2357)
### Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In one operation, you must:

1. Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element in `nums`.
2. Subtract `x` from every positive integer in `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make every element in `nums` equal to `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero elements only?**
    - Yes, the array can contain zero elements.

2. **What should be the output if `nums` is an empty array?**
    - If `nums` is an empty array, no operations are needed, so the minimum number of operations is `0`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the array length or the magnitude of the integers in `nums`?**
    - The problem does not specify constraints, but typically for LeetCode, arrays can have length up to 10^5 and elements can be as large as 10^9.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following points:
- Each operation reduces at least one non-zero element to zero.
- The operation essentially transforms the minimum non-zero element to zero.
- Every unique non-zero element in the array contributes to an operation since it has to be reduced to zero at some point.

The key observation is:
- The minimum number of operations needed to turn all elements to zero is equal to the number of unique non-zero elements in the array.

Steps:
1. Convert `nums` to a set to remove duplicate elements.
2. Remove zero from the set if it exists since zero doesn't require any operations.
3. The size of this set gives the number of unique non-zero elements, which is the answer.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(nums) {
    // Step 1: Create a set from nums to remove duplicates.
    let uniqueNums = new Set(nums);
    
    // Step 2: Remove zero from the set if it exists.
    uniqueNums.delete(0);
    
    // Step 3: Return the size of the set, which is the count of unique non-zero elements.
    return uniqueNums.size;
}

// Example Usage
let nums = [1, 5, 0, 1, 5, 0];
console.log(minOperations(nums));  // Output: 2 (Operations to reduce 1 and 5 to zero)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the array `nums`.
  - Constructing the set from the array takes linear time.
  - Removing zero from the set takes constant time.
  - Determining the size of the set takes constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case where all elements in `nums` are unique and non-zero.

This solution is efficient and should handle the typical constraints for LeetCode problems effectively.
