[Leetcode 890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l890)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of strings `words` and a single string `pattern`, you have to return a list of all the strings in `words` that matches the `pattern`. A string matches the pattern if there is a bijection between characters in the pattern and characters in the word.

**Example:**

Input:
```javascript
words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"]
pattern = "abb"
```
Output:
```javascript
["mee","aqq"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the strings?**
   - All strings (both in `words` and `pattern`) are of the same length.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters used in the strings?**
   - All strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **What is the expected output if no string matches the pattern?**
   - An empty list should be returned.

### Strategy

1. **Mapping Function:**
   - Define a function to transform a word into its pattern of indexed positions. For example, the word "abb" would transform to "011", "mee" to "011", and so on.
   
2. **Pattern Matching:**
   - Use this function to transform both the `pattern` and each word in `words`.
   - Compare the transformed strings to determine if a word matches the pattern.
   
3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Create a helper function `transform` to convert a given word to a pattern of indices.
   - Iterate through each word in `words` and check if its transformed version matches the transformed version of `pattern`.
   - Collect and return the words that satisfy this condition.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation for the problem:

```javascript
function findAndReplacePattern(words, pattern) {
    function transform(word) {
        const map = {};
        let pattern = '';
        let i = 0;
        
        for (let char of word) {
            if (!(char in map)) {
                map[char] = i;
                i++;
            }
            pattern += map[char];
        }
        
        return pattern;
    }

    const transformedPattern = transform(pattern);
    return words.filter(word => transform(word) === transformedPattern);
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"];
const pattern = "abb";
console.log(findAndReplacePattern(words, pattern)); // Output: ["mee","aqq"]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Transformation function:** O(N) where N is the length of the string.
- **Overall Complexity:**
  - For each word, the transformation function is called, so for `m` words, it becomes O(m * N).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m * N)**, where `m` is the number of words in the list and `N` is the length of each word. This is efficient given typical constraints.
