[Leetcode 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l508)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

A subtree sum is defined as the sum of all the node values in a particular subtree, including the root.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will there always be at least one node in the tree?
   - Yes, the tree will contain at least the root node.
2. Can the node values be negative?
   - Yes, the node values can be negative.
3. What should be done in case of a tie for the most frequent subtree sum?
   - Return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

### Strategy
1. Implement a helper function to calculate the sum of a subtree rooted at a given node and update the frequency map.
2. Traverse the tree using the Depth-First Search (DFS) method to calculate and store each subtree sum.
3. Use a hashmap (JavaScript Object) to keep track of the frequency of each subtree sum.
4. Determine the maximum frequency from the hashmap.
5. Collect and return all subtree sums that have this maximum frequency.

### Code

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
}

var findFrequentTreeSum = function(root) {
    const sumFrequency = {};

    // Helper function to calculate subtree sum
    function calculateSubtreeSum(node) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        const leftSum = calculateSubtreeSum(node.left);
        const rightSum = calculateSubtreeSum(node.right);
        const totalSum = node.val + leftSum + rightSum;

        sumFrequency[totalSum] = (sumFrequency[totalSum] || 0) + 1;

        return totalSum;
    }

    calculateSubtreeSum(root);

    let maxFrequency = 0;
    const result = [];

    for (const sum in sumFrequency) {
        if (sumFrequency.hasOwnProperty(sum)) {
            if (sumFrequency[sum] > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = sumFrequency[sum];
                result.length = 0;  // Reset result array
                result.push(Number(sum));
            } else if (sumFrequency[sum] === maxFrequency) {
                result.push(Number(sum));
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the binary tree.
   - In the worst case, every node is visited exactly once, making the time complexity O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - Building the frequency map and finding the maximum frequency also takes linear time O(N).
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space used by the call stack in recursive DFS is O(H), where H is the height of the tree.
   - In the worst case, H can be equal to N if the tree is skewed, so the space complexity for the call stack can be O(N).
   - The additional space used by the sumFrequency hashmap is also O(N) as it stores sums for each subtree.
   - Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N).
