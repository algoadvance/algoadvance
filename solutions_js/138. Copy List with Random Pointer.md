[Leetcode 138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l138)
### Problem Statement

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

The task is to make a deep copy of the list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the random pointer point to itself?
   - **A**: Yes, the random pointer can point to the node itself.

2. **Q**: Can the linked list be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the linked list can be empty. In that case, the output should be `null`.

3. **Q**: What are the constraints on the number of nodes in the linked list?
   - **A**: The number of nodes should be reasonable enough to fit within memory.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each node and its random pointer is correctly copied. We can do this in three main steps:

1. **Step 1 - Create new nodes interleaved with the original nodes**: This allows us to link the old nodes with the new nodes easily.
2. **Step 2 - Assign random pointers to the new nodes**: Using the interleaved structure to find corresponding random pointers without additional data structures.
3. **Step 3 - Separate the new nodes to form the deep copied list**: Restore the original list and extract the deep copied list.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a Node.
function Node(val, next, random) {
    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
    this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    this.random = random === undefined ? null : random;
}

/**
 * @param {Node} head
 * @return {Node}
 */
var copyRandomList = function(head) {
    if (head === null) return null;

    // Step 1: Create new nodes and insert them right after their corresponding old nodes.
    let current = head;
    while (current !== null) {
        let newNode = new Node(current.val, current.next, null);
        current.next = newNode;
        current = newNode.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Assign random pointers for the new nodes.
    current = head;
    while (current !== null) {
        if (current.random !== null) {
            current.next.random = current.random.next;
        }
        current = current.next.next;
    }

    // Step 3: Restore the original list and extract the copied list.
    let original = head;
    let copy = head.next;
    let copyHead = copy;

    while (original !== null) {
        original.next = original.next.next;
        if (copy.next !== null) {
            copy.next = copy.next.next;
        }
        original = original.next;
        copy = copy.next;
    }

    return copyHead;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list a constant number of times (three times).

- **Step 1**: \(O(n)\) - Creating new interleaved nodes.
- **Step 2**: \(O(n)\) - Assigning random pointers to new nodes.
- **Step 3**: \(O(n)\) - Separating the new nodes to form the copied list and restoring the original list.

Given that each node is processed a constant number of times, the operations remain linear in terms of the number of nodes in the list.
