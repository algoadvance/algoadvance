[Leetcode 152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l152)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product and return its product.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a contiguous subarray.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain zeros?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain zeros as seen in the given examples.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input array?**
   - The length of the input array is at least 1.

3. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain negative numbers.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - We'll traverse the array once while keeping track of the maximum product up to the current index (`maxProduct`), the minimum product up to the current index (`minProduct`), and the global maximum product found so far.

2. **Maintain Local Extremes**:
   - Since a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product, we need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum products up to the current point.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For every element in the array, calculate the maximum and minimum products of the subarray ending at the current position. The possible candidates for the maximum and minimum products at position `i` are:
     - The current element itself
     - The product of the current element and the maximum product up to the previous element
     - The product of the current element and the minimum product up to the previous element
     
4. **Update the Global Maximum**:
   - Update the global maximum product after processing each element.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```javascript
function maxProduct(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let maxProduct = nums[0];
    let minProduct = nums[0];
    let globalMax = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let current = nums[i];
        if (current < 0) {
            // Swap maxProduct and minProduct
            let temp = maxProduct;
            maxProduct = minProduct;
            minProduct = temp;
        }

        maxProduct = Math.max(current, maxProduct * current);
        minProduct = Math.min(current, minProduct * current);

        globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, maxProduct);
    }

    return globalMax;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because the array is traversed only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables (`maxProduct`, `minProduct`, and `globalMax`).

This solution efficiently computes the maximum product subarray in linear time without requiring additional space proportional to the input size.
