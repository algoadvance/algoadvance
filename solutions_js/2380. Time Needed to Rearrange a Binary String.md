[Leetcode 2380. Time Needed to Rearrange a Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2380)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s`. In one second, all '0's that are directly next to a '1' will swap places with the '1'. Return the number of seconds needed to complete this process fully. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Will the string `s` always contain at least one '0' and one '1'?
   - Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s` (e.g., maximum length)?

2. **Output Expected:**
   - Should the output be the minimum number of seconds to fully rearrange the string such that no '0' is directly adjacent to a '1'?
   - Can we assume that the input is always a valid binary string?

Assuming the string is non-empty and contains at least one '0' and one '1', and the string may be large enough to consider an optimal solution.

### Strategy

1. **Identification of Valid Moves:**
   - In each second, all '01' pairs can convert to '10'.
   
2. **Simulation Approach:**
   - Simulate the process by checking the string for '01' pairs and swapping them.
   - Continue this process until no more '01' pairs are found.
   - Count the number of iterations (seconds) needed for the process to complete.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Instead of simulating the entire string for each second, track the positions where swaps are needed, which can reduce the amount of comparison per iteration.

### Code

```javascript
function secondsToRemoveOccurrences(s) {
    let timeNeeded = 0;
    let hasSwaps = true;

    while (hasSwaps) {
        hasSwaps = false;
        let newString = s.split('');
        
        for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
            if (s[i] === '0' && s[i + 1] === '1') {
                newString[i] = '1';
                newString[i + 1] = '0';
                hasSwaps = true;
                i++; // Skip next index because it is already swapped
            }
        }
        
        s = newString.join('');
        if (hasSwaps) {
            timeNeeded++;
        }
    }
    
    return timeNeeded;
}

// Example usage:
let s = "0110101";
console.log(secondsToRemoveOccurrences(s)); // Expected output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the binary string.
  - In each second (iteration), we potentially scan the entire string, leading to a maximum of n scans, each taking O(n) time.

- **Best Case Time Complexity:** O(n), in scenarios where the string is already sorted or requires minimal operations.
  
The time complexity analysis may vary based on the initial configuration of the string, but the worst-case scenario will be O(n^2). This approach is straightforward and easy to implement but not the most efficient for very large strings.
