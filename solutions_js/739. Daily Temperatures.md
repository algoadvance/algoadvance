[Leetcode 739. Daily Temperatures](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l739)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0` instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all temperatures integer values?**
   - Yes, all temperatures are integers.
   
2. **Is there a maximum length for the list `T`?**
   - There isn't a specified maximum length, but you should assume it could be very large (e.g., up to 100,000 elements).

3. **What should be returned if the input list is empty?**
   - An empty list should be returned.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a **monotonic stack** to keep track of the indices of the temperatures. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a result list `res` filled with zeroes, having the same length as the input list `T`.
2. Iterate through the list `T`:
   - For the current temperature, check the stack:
     - While there's any element in the stack and the current temperature is higher than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, pop the stack. The difference between the current index and the popped index is the number of days until a warmer temperature.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
3. At the end, the stack might not be empty, but we don't need to process the remaining elements because they don't have any future warmer day.

### Code

```javascript
function dailyTemperatures(T) {
    const res = new Array(T.length).fill(0);
    const stack = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < T.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && T[i] > T[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const idx = stack.pop();
            res[idx] = i - idx;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return res;
}

// Example usage:
const T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73];
console.log(dailyTemperatures(T)); // Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input list `T`. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the result list and the stack used to store the indices.
