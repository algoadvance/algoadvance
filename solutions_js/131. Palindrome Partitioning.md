[Leetcode 131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l131)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

#### Example:

- Input: `s = "aab"`
- Output: `[["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, based on the problem statement, the string `s` is at least one character long.
  
2. **Is the string input guaranteed to consist only of lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the typical constraints for problems like this assume that the string only contains lowercase English letters.
  
3. **Can one assume that the output order of the partitions does not matter?**
   - Yes, the order of partitions in the resulting array does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking**:
   - We'll use backtracking to explore all possible partitions of the single string.
   - For every possible starting index, we'll check every potential substring ending index to see if it's a palindrome.
   - If it's a palindrome, recursively proceed to partition the rest of the string from the next index onward.
   - Maintain the current list of palindrome partitions being considered, and add it to the result if we reach the end of the string.

2. **Palindrome Check**:
   - We'll use a helper function to determine if a given substring is a palindrome.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var partition = function(s) {
    const results = [];
    
    // Helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome
    const isPalindrome = (str, left, right) => {
        while (left < right) {
            if (str[left] !== str[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    };

    // Helper function for backtracking
    const backtrack = (start, path) => {
        if (start === s.length) {
            results.push([...path]);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let end = start; end < s.length; end++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, end)) {
                path.push(s.substring(start, end + 1));
                backtrack(end + 1, path);
                path.pop();  // Backtrack
            }
        }
    };
    
    backtrack(0, []);
    return results;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **isPalindrome Function**:
   - Takes the string and two indices (left and right) as parameters.
   - Checks if the substring between these indices reads the same forward and backward.

2. **backtrack Function**:
   - Responsible for generating all possible palindrome partitions.
   - `start` parameter marks the beginning of the current substring being explored.
   - `path` is an array maintaining the current path of palindromes.
   - If start reaches the length of the string, the current path is added to the results since we've partitioned the entire string.
   - The loop explores all end indices from the start and checks if the current substring is a palindrome.
   - If it is, it adds to the path and recursively calls backtrack from the next index.
   - After exploring, it backtracks by removing the last element from the path.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(N * 2^N)**, where N is the length of the string.
   - This is because there are 2^N possible substrings of the string.
   - For each substring, it takes O(N) time to check if it's a palindrome in the worst case.
  
This exponential time complexity is due to the nature of generating all possible partitions, and it is expected for a problem involving backtracking with exponential possibilities.
