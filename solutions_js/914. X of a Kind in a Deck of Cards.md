[Leetcode 914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l914)
### Problem Statement

Given a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it. Return true if and only if you can divide the deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

1. Each group has exactly `X` cards.
2. All the cards in each group have the same integer.

You need to find out if there is a positive integer `X` that is a divisor of the number of cards in the deck such that all the cards can be evenly divided into groups of `X` cards.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Is the input guaranteed to be an array of integers where each integer represents a card in the deck?
   - Yes, the input is an array of integers.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: What if the deck is empty?
   - If the deck is empty, you cannot form any groups, so return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency**: First, count the frequency of each card in the deck.
2. **Calculate GCD**: Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these frequencies.
3. **Check Validity**: If the GCD is greater than 1, it means you can group the deck into groups of size `GCD`. If the GCD is 1, you cannot form such groups with size greater than 1.

### Code

Here is the implementation based on the strategy:

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b) {
        [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
}

function hasGroupsSizeX(deck) {
    if (deck.length === 0) return false;

    // Count frequencies
    const countMap = {};
    for (const card of deck) {
        countMap[card] = (countMap[card] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Get all the frequencies
    const counts = Object.values(countMap);

    // Find the gcd of all the frequencies
    let g = counts[0];
    for (const count of counts) {
        g = gcd(g, count);
    }

    // If the gcd is greater than 1, return true, else false
    return g > 1;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(hasGroupsSizeX([1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]));  // Output: true
console.log(hasGroupsSizeX([1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]));  // Output: false
console.log(hasGroupsSizeX([1]));               // Output: false
console.log(hasGroupsSizeX([1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2])); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequency**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of cards in the deck.
2. **Calculating GCD**: If there are `k` unique card values, the GCD computation across all frequencies would be `O(k * log(m))` where `m` is the maximum value in the frequency array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + k * log(m))`.

This solution is efficient for typical input sizes encountered in such problems.
