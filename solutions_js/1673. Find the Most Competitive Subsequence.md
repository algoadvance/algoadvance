[Leetcode 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1673)
**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more competitive than a subsequence `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number less than the corresponding number in subsequence `b`. Since the subsequence of `nums` of size `k` should be as competitive as possible, we need to find out such a subsequence.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array and `k`?
   - Let's consider that `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

2. Can you give an example?
   - Sure. For example, if `nums = [3, 5, 2, 6]` and `k = 2`, the most competitive subsequence of size `k` is `[2, 6]`.

**Strategy:**

1. Use a greedy approach combined with a stack to ensure the subsequence's competitiveness.
2. Iterate through `nums` and maintain a stack to store the elements of the resulting subsequence.
3. To ensure the subsequence is competitive:
   - We can remove elements from the stack if the current element is smaller than the stack's top element, provided that removing them still allows us to complete the subsequence of size `k` with the remaining elements.
4. Push the current element to the stack.
5. At the end, ensure the stack's size is exactly `k`, and if not, pop elements from the end until it is.

**Code:**

```javascript
function mostCompetitive(nums, k) {
    let stack = [];
    let n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Try to maintain the most competitive subsequence
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > nums[i] && (stack.length - 1 + n - i) >= k) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        
        // Append current element to the stack if we haven't met the size limit
        if (stack.length < k) {
            stack.push(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    
    return stack;
}
```

**Time Complexity:**

- The time complexity of the above solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once pushed onto the stack, once popped from the stack).
- The space complexity is `O(k)`, since the stack will store at most `k` elements.
