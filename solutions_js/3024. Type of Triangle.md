[Leetcode 3024. Type of Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3024)
### Problem Statement

You are given three numbers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. You need to determine the type of the triangle: 

- Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Exactly two sides are equal.
- Scalene: All sides are of different lengths.
- Not a triangle: The given sides do not form a valid triangle.

The sides form a valid triangle if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input range**: What is the possible range for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   - All side lengths are positive integers.
   
2. **Output**: What kind of output is expected?
   - The output should be a string indicating the type of the triangle: `"Equilateral"`, `"Isosceles"`, `"Scalene"`, or `"Not a triangle"`.

### Strategy

1. **Check for Valid Triangle**: 
    - Use the triangle inequality theorem which states that, for any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.
    - This gives us the conditions:
      - `a + b > c`
      - `a + c > b`
      - `b + c > a`
    - If these conditions are satisfied, the sides can form a triangle. Otherwise, it is not a valid triangle.
  
2. **Determine the Type of Triangle**:
    - If all three sides are equal (`a == b == c`), it is an Equilateral triangle.
    - If exactly two sides are equal (`a == b`, `b == c`, or `a == c`), it is an Isosceles triangle.
    - If none of the sides are equal (`a != b != c`), it is a Scalene triangle.

### Code

```javascript
function triangleType(a, b, c) {
    // Checking for the validity of the triangle
    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a) {
        return "Not a triangle";
    }
    
    // Determine the type of triangle
    if (a === b && b === c) {
        return "Equilateral";
    } else if (a === b || b === c || a === c) {
        return "Isosceles";
    } else {
        return "Scalene";
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(triangleType(3, 4, 5));  // Output: Scalene
console.log(triangleType(3, 3, 3));  // Output: Equilateral
console.log(triangleType(3, 3, 4));  // Output: Isosceles
console.log(triangleType(1, 2, 3));  // Output: Not a triangle
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because it involves only a constant amount of comparisons and operations.
- Space complexity is also **O(1)** as it uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.
