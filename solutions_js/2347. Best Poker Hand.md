[Leetcode 2347. Best Poker Hand](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2347)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. These arrays represent the ranks and suits of a hand of 5 cards. Your task is to determine the best possible "poker hand" that can be made with these cards according to the following categories (listed from best to worst):

- "Flush": All 5 cards have the same suit.
- "Three of a Kind": Three cards have the same rank.
- "Pair": Two cards have the same rank.
- "High Card": No cards form any of the above categories.

Return a string representing the best possible hand.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Will the input always consist of exactly 5 cards?
   - **A:** Yes, the input will always consist of 5 cards.

2. **Q:** What are the possible values for the `ranks` array?
   - **A:** The ranks are integers between 1 and 13.

3. **Q:** What are the possible values for the `suits` array?
   - **A:** The suits are characters and can be 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'.

### Strategy
1. **Check for Flush**: If all suits in the `suits` array are the same, return "Flush".
2. **Calculate Rank Frequencies**: Create a frequency map to count the occurrences of each rank in the `ranks` array.
3. **Check for Three of a Kind**: If any rank appears at least 3 times, return "Three of a Kind".
4. **Check for Pair**: If any rank appears exactly 2 times, return "Pair".
5. **Default to High Card**: If none of the above conditions are met, return "High Card".

### Code
```javascript
function bestHand(ranks, suits) {
    // Check for Flush
    if (suits.every(suit => suit === suits[0])) {
        return "Flush";
    }

    // Calculate rank frequencies
    let rankCount = {};
    for (let rank of ranks) {
        rankCount[rank] = (rankCount[rank] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Check for Three of a Kind and Pair
    let threeOfKind = false;
    let pair = false;

    for (let count of Object.values(rankCount)) {
        if (count >= 3) {
            threeOfKind = true;
        } else if (count == 2) {
            pair = true;
        }
    }

    if (threeOfKind) {
        return "Three of a Kind";
    } else if (pair) {
        return "Pair";
    }

    return "High Card";
}

// Example usage
console.log(bestHand([1, 2, 3, 3, 3], ['a', 'b', 'a', 'a', 'a']));  // Outputs: "Three of a Kind"
console.log(bestHand([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a']));  // Outputs: "Flush"
console.log(bestHand([1, 2, 3, 3, 5], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a']));  // Outputs: "Pair"
console.log(bestHand([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a']));  // Outputs: "High Card"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Checking for Flush**: \(O(1)\) as it involves checking if all suits are the same, which can be done in a constant number of operations (since there are always 5 cards).
- **Calculating Rank Frequencies**: \(O(5)\), as it involves iterating over the `ranks` array (fixed size 5).
- **Checking for Patterns (Three of a Kind/Pair)**: \(O(1)\), since we are just iterating over a fixed number of rank counts.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(1)\).
