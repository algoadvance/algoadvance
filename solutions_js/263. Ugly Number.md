[Leetcode 263. Ugly Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l263)
### Problem Statement

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is an ugly number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `n` be a negative number or zero?
   - **A:** No, an ugly number should be a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to zero, it cannot be an ugly number.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify constraints, so we can assume standard integer limits.

### Strategy

To determine if a number `n` is an ugly number, we can repeatedly divide `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it is divisible by these numbers. If after all these divisions, the remaining `n` is 1, then `n` is an ugly number. If the remaining number is anything other than 1, then `n` contains prime factors other than 2, 3, or 5, and hence it is not an ugly number.

### Implementation

```javascript
var isUgly = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    
    // Array of prime factors to check against
    const factors = [2, 3, 5];
    
    for (const factor of factors) {
        while (n % factor === 0) {
            n /= factor;
        }
    }
    
    return n === 1;
};

// Example usage
console.log(isUgly(6));  // true (6 = 2 * 3)
console.log(isUgly(8));  // true (8 = 2 * 2 * 2)
console.log(isUgly(14)); // false (14 has prime factors 2 and 7)
console.log(isUgly(-6)); // false (negative number)
console.log(isUgly(0));  // false (zero)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(log n)**, where `n` is the given number:

- The while loops repeatedly divide `n` by 2, 3, and 5.
- In the worst case, each division operation reduces `n` significantly, resulting in logarithmic behavior.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
