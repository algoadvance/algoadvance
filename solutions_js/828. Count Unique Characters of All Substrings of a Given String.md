[Leetcode 828. Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l828)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the sum of count of unique characters of all substrings of `s`. The count of unique characters of a string is the number of characters that appear exactly once in the string.

For example, given `s = "ABC"`, the substrings are "A", "B", "C", "AB", "BC", and "ABC". 
Among them, the unique characters are:
- "A" -> count is 1
- "B" -> count is 1
- "C" -> count is 1
- "AB" -> count is 2
- "BC" -> count is 2
- "ABC" -> count with unique characters only "A", "B", and "C"

Return the sum of counts of unique characters for all the substrings.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of uppercase English letters only.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - Is the input always a valid string consisting of only uppercase letters? 
   - Yes.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be an integer representing the sum of counts of unique characters for all substrings?
   - Yes.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What is the expected output for the minimum length string "A"?
     - The output should be 1 because "A" only has one unique character.
   - How should the solution handle repeated characters?
     - The solution should only count characters that appear exactly once in each subset.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute force solution that checks all substrings is impractical due to the potential size. Instead, we can use a more efficient strategy:
1. Each character contributes to the count of unique characters in multiple substrings.
2. Track the first and last occurrence of each character.
3. Calculate the contribution of each character to the total count of unique characters efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an array `positions` to track the last and second last occurrence of each character.
2. Initialize a variable to store the result.
3. Iterate through the string to update positions and calculate contributions of characters.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var uniqueLetterString = function(s) {
    const lastIndex = new Array(26).fill(-1);
    const prevIndex = new Array(26).fill(-1);
    
    const n = s.length;
    let result = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const charCode = s.charCodeAt(i) - 65;
        if (prevIndex[charCode] !== -1) {
            result += (i - lastIndex[charCode]) * (lastIndex[charCode] - prevIndex[charCode]);
        }
        prevIndex[charCode] = lastIndex[charCode];
        lastIndex[charCode] = i;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (lastIndex[i] !== -1) {
            result += (n - lastIndex[i]) * (lastIndex[i] - prevIndex[i]);
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string. We make a single pass through the string to track character positions.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` additional space as we use fixed-size arrays to track the last and second last occurrences of characters.
