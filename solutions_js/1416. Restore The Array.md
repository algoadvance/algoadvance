[Leetcode 1416. Restore The Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1416)
### Problem Statement
A program needs to generate an array of positive integers from a given string s. Each integer in the array must be between 1 and k (inclusive). The numbers cannot have leading zeros, and the array should be structured in such a way that when all the integers are concatenated, they form the original string.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, your task is to count the number of possible arrays that can be formed this way. Since the answer could be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example
- **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: s = "1000", k = 10000
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The only array that can be formed is [1000]
  ```

- **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: s = "1000", k = 10
  Output: 0
  Explanation: There cannot be any array formed since 1000 is greater than 10.
  ```

- **Example 3:**

  ```
  Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
  Output: 8
  Explanation: Possible arrays are [13, 1, 7], [1, 3, 17], [1, 31, 7], etc.
  ```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is the string `s` always composed of digits?
   **A:** Yes, the string `s` consists of numeric characters only.

2. **Q:** Can the string `s` contain leading zeros?
   **A:** Yes, but the numbers formed in the array should not have leading zeros (except "0" itself, which is not allowed since the numbers should be in the range [1, k]).

3. **Q:** What is the range of the values of `k`?
   **A:** The values of `k` and the length of `s` can be large, up to 10^9 and 10^5 respectively.

4. **Q:** Do we need to consider the modulo operation for large answers?
   **A:** Yes, the result should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to restore the array using the substring `s[0:i]`.

Steps:
1. Create a `dp` array initialized with zeros of length `len(s) + 1`.
2. Set `dp[0]` to 1 as there is one way to make an empty array.
3. Iterate through the string, and for each position, check all substrings that end at that position and are valid numbers (between 1 and k).
4. Update the `dp` array based on valid numbers:
   - If the number formed by the substring `s[j:i]` is valid (between 1 and k and doesn't have leading zeros), then `dp[i]` can be incremented by `dp[j]`.
5. Return `dp[len(s)]` as the result after taking modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
function numberOfArrays(s, k) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            const subStr = s.slice(j, i);
            const num = parseInt(subStr, 10);
            if (subStr[0] === '0') break; // leading zero, invalid number
            if (num > k) break; // number exceeds k, invalid range
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
console.log(numberOfArrays("1317", 2000));  // Output: 8
console.log(numberOfArrays("1000", 10000)); // Output: 1
console.log(numberOfArrays("1000", 10));    // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^2)**:
- The outer loop runs `n` times (for each character in `s`).
- The inner loop can run up to `n` times in the worst case.

Given the constraints, this complexity should be manageable within reasonable input sizes.
