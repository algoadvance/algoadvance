[Leetcode 2913. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2913)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` that consists of `n` distinct integers, return the sum of squares of the maximum number of distinct elements in a subarray taken from the array.

### Clarifying Questions
To better understand the problem, let's clarify a few details:
1. What is the definition of "subarray" in this context? 
   - A contiguous part of the array.
2. Are all integers in the `nums` array guaranteed to be distinct?
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions that the integers are distinct.
3. Are the subarrays considered individually or in terms of their collective distinct elements?
   - The problem seeks the subarray with the maximum number of distinct elements and then returns the sum of the squares of these elements.
4. Is there any constraint on the length of the input array?
   - Typically, constraints are provided, but assuming reasonable size for the context of the problem seems appropriate unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can adopt a sliding window (or two-pointers) approach to find subarrays with maximum distinct elements since the problem involves subarrays:

1. Initialize pointers for the sliding window (start and end), and a set to store distinct elements within the window.
2. Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and include elements until either all elements are distinct, or we can no longer expand without repeating an element.
3. Calculate the sum of squares of the distinct elements within the current window.
4. Move the `start` pointer to shrink the window and continue examining new subarrays.
5. Maintain and update the maximum sum of squares encountered during this process.
6. Return the maximum sum of squares as the result.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function sumOfSquaresOfDistinctElements(nums) {
  let n = nums.length;
  let start = 0;
  let maxSumOfSquares = 0;
  let currentDistinctSet = new Set();
  let currentSumOfSquares = 0;

  for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
    while (currentDistinctSet.has(nums[end])) {
      currentDistinctSet.delete(nums[start]);
      currentSumOfSquares -= nums[start] * nums[start];
      start++;
    }
    currentDistinctSet.add(nums[end]);
    currentSumOfSquares += nums[end] * nums[end];
    maxSumOfSquares = Math.max(maxSumOfSquares, currentSumOfSquares);
  }

  return maxSumOfSquares;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(sumOfSquaresOfDistinctElements(nums)); // Output example
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above solution is O(n) because each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window with the `end` pointer and once when contracting the window with the `start` pointer).

- Space complexity: O(n) for the `Set` used to store the distinct elements. 

This makes the solution efficient in terms of both time and space.
