[Leetcode 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l154)
## Problem Statement

Suppose an array of length \( n \) sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and \( n \) times. Given the **array `nums`** that may contain duplicates, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- \( n == nums.length \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 5000 \)
- \(-5000 \leq nums[i] \leq 5000 \)
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between 1 and \( n \) times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the range of elements is from -5000 to 5000.
2. **What if the array is not rotated at all?**
   - The array can be considered as rotated 0 times, and the minimum would just be the first element.
3. **Is there a time complexity constraint you are aiming for?**
   - Yes, aiming for better than \( O(n) \) if possible, ideally \( O(\log n) \).

## Strategy

The given array is sorted and rotated. This provides an opportunity to use a form of binary search to find the minimum element, though the presence of duplicates might complicate the logic slightly.

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Use two pointers `left` and `right` at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. **Binary Search Modification**: 
   - Calculate the middle index `mid` as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - Compare the `mid` element with the `right` element:
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, it means the smallest value is in the left half including `mid`.
     - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, it means the smallest value is in the right half excluding `mid`.
     - When `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, it's uncertain where the pivot is due to duplicates, so decrement `right` to reduce the problem size.
3. **Convergence**: When `left` equals `right`, we've found the smallest element.

## Code

Hereâ€™s a JavaScript function to execute this strategy:

```javascript
function findMin(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
            right = mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            // nums[mid] == nums[right], reduce the search space
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return nums[left];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Best case**: \( O(\log n) \) for binary search without needing to handle too many duplicates.
- **Worst case**: \( O(n) \) due to potential degradation from duplicates (e.g., when all elements are the same, each step only removes one element).

This approach ensures that under typical circumstances, you benefit from logarithmic time complexity, while also correctly handling cases with many duplicates.
