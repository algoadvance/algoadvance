[Leetcode 523. Continuous Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l523)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a continuous subarray of at least length 2 whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, or `false` otherwise.

An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `k` is 0?**
   - If `k` is 0, any subarray that sums up to `0` should satisfy the condition since `0` is always a multiple of `0`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values in the array and `k`?**
   - The array `nums` and integer `k` can be positive, negative, or zero due to the given descriptions.

3. **What if the input array has less than two elements?**
   - If `nums` has fewer than two elements, it cannot have a subarray of at least length 2, so the function should return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function checkSubarraySum(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length < 2) {
        return false;
    }

    const prefixSumRemainder = new Map();
    prefixSumRemainder.set(0, -1); // This handles cases where the subarray starts from index 0

    let runningSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        runningSum += nums[i];

        let remainder = runningSum % k;
        // If k is zero, we need to avoid division by zero, treat all elements directly
        if (k !== 0) {
            remainder = (remainder + k) % k; // This ensures the remainder is positive
        }

        if (prefixSumRemainder.has(remainder)) {
            if (i - prefixSumRemainder.get(remainder) > 1) {
                return true;
            }
        } else {
            prefixSumRemainder.set(remainder, i);
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Track Remainders:** Use a map to track the first occurrence of each remainder when the cumulative sum is divided by `k`.
2. **Prefix Sum Approach:** Calculate the running sum of the elements.
3. **Finding Valid Subarray:** For each index, compute the remainder of the running sum when divided by `k`. If this remainder has been observed before and the subarray length is at least 2, then such a subarray exists.
4. **Handle Corner Cases:** Special handling for `k = 0` and ensuring the remainder value is always positive.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - where \(n\) is the length of the input array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\min(n, k))\) - We store a map of remainders which, in the best case, could store up to `k` remainders. In the worst case, it could store up to `n` remainders.

This solution ensures efficient checking of the subarray sum conditions with linear time complexity, making it scalable for large input sizes.
