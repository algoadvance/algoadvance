[Leetcode 1201. Ugly Number III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1201)
### Problem Statement

You are asked to find the nth ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive integers which are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`. Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, you need to return the nth ugly number.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can I assume that `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9`?
   - Are `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be distinct?

2. **Output:**
   - Should I return the nth ugly number as a single integer?

Assuming the answers are:
1. Yes, you can assume the constraints as mentioned.
2. Yes, return the nth ugly number as a single integer.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, I will employ a binary search combined with the inclusion-exclusion principle. 

**Key steps**:
1. **Binary Search**: Since the number can grow large and we need an efficient way to find the nth number, we use binary search over the possible range of ugly numbers.
2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Determine how many numbers up to a certain number `x` are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`. This helps in counting the ugly numbers correctly.

**Helper Function**:
- `countUglyNumbers(x, a, b, c)`: This function uses the Inclusion-Exclusion principle to count how many numbers from 1 to `x` are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

**Binary Search Details**:
- Start with an initial range from 1 to the maximum possible value.
- Calculate the midpoint and use the helper function to get the count of ugly numbers up to that midpoint.
- Adjust the search range based on whether the count is less than or at least `n`.

### Time Complexity
The solution operates with a time complexity of `O(log(maxVal) * O(countUglyNumbers))`, where `maxVal` is the highest value in the search range. Given that `countUglyNumbers` operates in constant time, this approach is efficient.

### Code

```javascript
var nthUglyNumber = function(n, a, b, c) {
    const gcd = (x, y) => y === 0 ? x : gcd(y, x % y);
    const lcm = (x, y) => (x * y) / gcd(x, y);

    const countUglyNumbers = (x, a, b, c) => {
        return Math.floor(x / a) +
               Math.floor(x / b) +
               Math.floor(x / c) -
               Math.floor(x / lcm(a, b)) -
               Math.floor(x / lcm(b, c)) -
               Math.floor(x / lcm(a, c)) +
               Math.floor(x / lcm(a, lcm(b, c)));
    };

    let low = 1,
        high = 2 * 10 ** 9,
        answer = 0;

    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        const count = countUglyNumbers(mid, a, b, c);

        if (count >= n) {
            answer = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return answer;
};
```

This code defines a main function `nthUglyNumber` that utilizes a helper function `countUglyNumbers` for performing the search within a specific range using binary search. The inclusion-exclusion principle ensures accurate counting of the ugly numbers up to the middle point during each iteration.
