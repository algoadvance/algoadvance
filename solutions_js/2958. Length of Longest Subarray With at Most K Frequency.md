[Leetcode 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2958)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous segment of an array. The task is to find the length of the longest subarray where the difference between the frequency of the maximum occurring element and the frequency of the minimum occurring element in the subarray is at most `k`.

Write a function:
```javascript
function longestSubarray(nums, k) {
    // Your code here
}
```
**Example:**
```javascript
longestSubarray([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2], 1) // Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative values.
2. **Can the value of `k` be 0?**
   - Yes, `k` can be 0.
3. **Is the array size constraint given?**
   - Typically, arrays will have up to `10^5` elements, and elements will be in the range of `-10^4` to `10^4`.
4. **What is the minimum and maximum value of `k`?**
   - `k` can be within the range `[0, n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using the sliding window technique combined with a frequency map. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Utilize two pointers to define the window's bounds (left and right).
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer and update the frequency of elements within the window using a hashmap.
   - Check the frequency counts to see if the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency of elements in the window is at most `k`.
   - If the condition is met, update the maximum length of the subarray.
   - If the condition is not met, shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer until the condition is satisfied again.

2. **Frequency Map Consideration:**
   - Use a hashmap (`freqMap`) to count the frequency of elements in the current window.
   - Keep track of min_freq and max_freq dynamically to verify the condition.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a possible implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestSubarray(nums, k) {
    let left = 0, right = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;
    let freqMap = new Map();

    while (right < nums.length) {
        // Extend the window by including nums[right]
        freqMap.set(nums[right], (freqMap.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
        right++;

        while (true) {
            // Check the frequency differences
            let minFreq = Math.min(...freqMap.values());
            let maxFreq = Math.max(...freqMap.values());

            if (maxFreq - minFreq <= k) {
                break;
            }

            // Shrink the window from the left
            freqMap.set(nums[left], freqMap.get(nums[left]) - 1);
            if (freqMap.get(nums[left]) === 0) {
                freqMap.delete(nums[left]);
            }
            left++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)` due to the call to `Math.max` and `Math.min`, as iterating over the values of `freqMap` could take `O(n)`. This isn't efficient for large inputs.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` in the worst case due to the usage of `freqMap`.

### Optimizing the Approach

To avoid recalculating min and max frequencies repeatedly, we can maintain two heaps or additional structures that dynamically keep track of minimum and maximum frequencies, but that adds complexity. For optimization purposes, you might want to use more sophisticated data structures or algorithms to avoid the nested loop over the frequency map.
