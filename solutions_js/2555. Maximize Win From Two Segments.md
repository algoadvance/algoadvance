[Leetcode 2555. Maximize Win From Two Segments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2555)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers. You are allowed to select exactly two non-overlapping contiguous subarrays (segments) of the given array such that the sum of these two subarrays is maximized.

Write a function `maximizeWin(nums: number[]): number` that returns the maximum possible sum that can be obtained from selecting the two non-overlapping subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Array Size:** What is the range of the length of the input array? (This will help in understanding the feasibility of certain methods based on time complexity.)
2. **Negative Numbers:** Can the array contain negative numbers, and if so, can a subarray contain only negative numbers? (This affects how we consider subarrays for maximization.)
3. **Length of Segments:** Are there any constraints on the lengths of the two segments?

Given the complexity and variety of possible answers, it's expected that once we clarify the inputs, we can devise an optimized dynamic programming approach.

### Code

Here is a solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maximizeWin(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;

    // Compute maximum subarray sum ending at each index using Kadane's algorithm
    const dp1 = new Array(n).fill(-Infinity);  // max sum subarray ending at or before index i
    let currentMax = -Infinity;
    let currentSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        currentSum = (currentSum + nums[i] > nums[i]) ? currentSum + nums[i] : nums[i];
        currentMax = (currentMax > currentSum) ? currentMax : currentSum;
        dp1[i] = currentMax;
    }

    // Compute maximum subarray sum starting at each index
    const dp2 = new Array(n).fill(-Infinity);  // max sum subarray starting at or after index i
    currentMax = -Infinity;
    currentSum = 0;

    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        currentSum = (currentSum + nums[i] > nums[i]) ? currentSum + nums[i] : nums[i];
        currentMax = (currentMax > currentSum) ? currentMax : currentSum;
        dp2[i] = currentMax;
    }

    // Find the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays
    let maxSum = -Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        maxSum = (maxSum > (dp1[i] + dp2[i + 1])) ? maxSum : (dp1[i] + dp2[i + 1]);
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Kadane's Algorithm for Subarray Sum:** 
   - We first calculate the maximum subarray sum that ends at or before each index using Kadane's algorithm and store these values in an array `dp1`.
   - Similarly, we compute the maximum subarray sum that starts at or after each index and store these values in another array `dp2`.

2. **Combining Results:**
   - After filling `dp1` and `dp2`, we combine these to find the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays such that the end of one subarray is before the start of the other.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - We iterate over possible partitions and calculate the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays using precomputed maximum sums.

### Time Complexity

- **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm** runs in `O(n)` for both forward and backward passes.
- Combining results also runs in `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is efficient and manageable for reasonably large arrays.
