[Leetcode 2384. Largest Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2384)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `num` consisting of digits only. Your task is to construct the largest palindromic number (not necessarily distinct) that can be formed using some or all of the digits in `num`. The resulting number should not have leading zeros unless it is the number "0" itself.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty and valid?
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be in string format?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length of the input string or the range of digits?

### Code Strategy
1. **Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each digit (0-9) in the given string.
2. **Palindrome Construction**:
   - **Middle Digit**: Identify if there can be a middle digit (the highest odd frequency digit).
   - **Halves Construction**: Construct the first half using the highest even frequencies of digits.
3. **Form Palindrome**:
   - Concatenate the first half, the middle digit (if any), and the reverse of the first half to form the largest palindromic number.
4. **Remove Leading Zeros**: Ensure that the largest palindrome does not start with zero unless it is "0".

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input string, since we only pass through the string a constant number of times.

### Code

```javascript
function largestPalindromic(num) {
    // Step 1: Frequency count
    const freq = Array(10).fill(0);
    for (const digit of num) {
        freq[digit]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Construct the palindrome components
    let firstHalf = "";
    let middleDigit = "";

    // Identify the middle digit (if any), and construct the first half
    for (let digit = 9; digit >= 0; digit--) {
        // If we can form a middle digit, choose the highest digit with an odd count
        if (freq[digit] % 2 === 1 && middleDigit === "") {
            middleDigit = digit.toString();
        }

        // Add as many pairs of this digit as possible to the first half
        const pairs = Math.floor(freq[digit] / 2);
        firstHalf += digit.toString().repeat(pairs);
    }

    // Step 3: Form the final palindrome
    const secondHalf = firstHalf.split("").reverse().join("");
    let result = firstHalf + middleDigit + secondHalf;

    // Handle the case where the result has leading zeros
    if (result[0] === "0") {
        // Only a single zero is a valid result in this case
        result = "0";
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(largestPalindromic("444947137")); // Outputs: "7449447"
console.log(largestPalindromic("00009"));     // Outputs: "9"
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Frequency Count**: We count how many times each digit appears in the string.
2. **Middle Digit**: We identify the highest single digit that can be used in the middle (if there exists any such digit).
3. **First Half Construction**: We build the first half of the palindrome by repeating each digit pair as many times as possible.
4. **Final Concatenation & Leading Zero Handling**: We concatenate the first half, middle digit, and reverse of the first half, ensuring the result doesn't incorrectly start with zeros.

This approach ensures we get the largest possible palindromic number efficiently while maintaining correct formatting.
