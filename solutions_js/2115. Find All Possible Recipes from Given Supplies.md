[Leetcode 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2115)
## Problem Statement
You are given a list of `recipes` where `recipes[i]` is the name of the `i-th` recipe. You are also given a list of `ingredients` where `ingredients[i]` is a list of all the ingredients needed to create the `i-th` recipe from `recipes`. Additionally, you are given a list `supplies` containing all the ingredients that you initially have. 

You need to find all possible recipes that can be made. A recipe can be made if you have all its ingredients available in your supplies or if you can make all ingredients by using other recipes.

Return a list of all the recipes that can be made in any order.

### Example
```python
Input: recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]
Output: ["bread"]

Input: recipes = ["bread", "sandwich"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","ham"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","ham"]
Output: ["bread", "sandwich"]
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= recipes.length <= 100`
- `1 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <= 10`
- `recipes[i], ingredients[i][j]`, and `supplies[k]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- All the values of `recipes` and `supplies` are unique.
- There are no duplicate values in `ingredients[i]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done if a recipe cannot be made with the given supplies and other recipes?
    - It should be omitted from the final output.
2. Can we assume that the input formats are always valid, i.e., proper lists and non-empty as indicated by constraints?
    - Yes.

## Code
```javascript
function findAllRecipes(recipes, ingredients, supplies) {
    const supplySet = new Set(supplies);
    const recipeMap = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < recipes.length; i++) {
        recipeMap.set(recipes[i], ingredients[i]);
    }

    const result = [];
    let change = true;
    
    while (change) {
        change = false;
        
        for (const [recipe, ingList] of recipeMap.entries()) {
            if (ingList.every(ing => supplySet.has(ing))) {
                supplySet.add(recipe);
                result.push(recipe);
                recipeMap.delete(recipe);
                change = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialize** a set from the given `supplies`.
2. **Map** each recipe to its list of ingredients.
3. **Iterate** through the recipes and continually update the set of supplies:
    - Check the ingredients of each recipe. If all ingredients are in the supplies set, add this recipe to the supplies set and result list.
    - Remove the recipe from the map once it is added to the supplies set.
4. **Repeat** the above steps until no new recipes can be made.

This solution ensures that we check all possible recipes iteratively and leverages a `while` loop to ensure all possible dependencies between recipes are resolved.

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: Creating the `supplySet` and `recipeMap` takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the sum of the lengths of the recipes and ingredients.
- **Main Loop**: In the worst case, each recipe is checked once per iteration over all remaining recipes. This results in `O(n^2)` in the worst-case scenario, especially if we consider frequently moving recipes in and out of the map.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of recipes.
