[Leetcode 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1160)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`. A string is considered good if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

### Example
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
- `words[i]` and `chars` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `chars` contain duplicate characters?**
   - Yes, and each character in `chars` can only be used once for each word.
   
2. **Are all characters in `words` and `chars` lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, they are all lowercase English letters.

3. **What should be the output when no words can be formed?**
   - In that case, return `0`.

### Strategy for Solution

1. **Character Count Mapping**: Create a character frequency map for `chars` to quickly verify if a word can be formed.
2. **Verification**: For each word in `words`, create a similar frequency map and check if the counts for each character in the word are within the limits specified by the `chars` frequency map.
3. **Summing Valid Lengths**: Maintain a sum of lengths of words that can be formed from `chars`.

### Code

```javascript
function countCharacters(words, chars) {
    // Helper function to create a frequency map of characters
    function createFrequencyMap(str) {
        const map = {};
        for (let char of str) {
            map[char] = (map[char] || 0) + 1;
        }
        return map;
    }

    // Create frequency map for the given chars
    const charsMap = createFrequencyMap(chars);
    let totalLength = 0;

    // Check each word in words array
    for (let word of words) {
        const wordMap = createFrequencyMap(word);
        let canForm = true;

        // Check if the word can be formed by chars
        for (let char in wordMap) {
            if (!(char in charsMap) || wordMap[char] > charsMap[char]) {
                canForm = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (canForm) {
            totalLength += word.length;
        }
    }

    return totalLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Creating Frequency Map**: O(N) where N is the length of `chars`.
- **Processing Each Word**: Suppose there are `W` words with an average length of `L`. Creating the map and checking it will be O(W * L).
  
Overall time complexity: O(W * L + N).

### Space Complexity

- The frequency map will require O(1) space as there are only fixed 26 letters in the English alphabet.
  
Overall space complexity: O(1) in terms of additional space used.
