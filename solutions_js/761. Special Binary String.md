[Leetcode 761. Special Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l761)
### Problem Statement

761. Special Binary String

A special binary string is a non-empty binary string (containing only 0s and 1s) with the following properties:
1. The number of 0s is equal to the number of 1s.
2. Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1s as 0s.

You can swap any two special binary strings to make the largest lexicographical order.

The given string is guaranteed to be a special binary string.

**Example:**

```
Input: "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we expect that the input string will always be a valid special binary string?**
   - Yes, as per the problem, the given string is guaranteed to be a special binary string.

2. **Are there constraints on the size of the input string?**
   - The constraints are not explicitly given, but we can assume it will be reasonable for typical coding challenges (e.g., up to a few thousand characters).

3. **Is the output expected to be the largest lexicographical order of the entire input string?**
   - Yes, we need to rearrange the substrings to form the largest lexicographical order.

### Strategy

1. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - Parse the string into the smallest special binary substrings.
   - Recursively process each substring.
   - Sort and concatenate these special substrings to form the largest possible string in lexicographical order.

2. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Iterate through the string and divide it at balanced points where the number of '1's matches the number of '0's.
   - Recursively sort the substrings in descending lexicographical order.
   - Return the concatenated result of sorted substrings.

### Code

```javascript
function makeLargestSpecial(s) {
    const makeLargestSpecialHelper = (s) => {
        let count = 0, i = 0;
        const substrings = [];
        
        for (let j = 0; j < s.length; j++) {
            if (s[j] === '1') count++;
            else count--;
            // When a balanced substring is found
            if (count === 0) {
                let inner = s.slice(i + 1, j);
                // Recursively process the inner string and wrap with '1' and '0'
                substrings.push('1' + makeLargestSpecialHelper(inner) + '0');
                i = j + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the substrings in descending lexicographical order and join them
        substrings.sort((a, b) => b.localeCompare(a));
        return substrings.join('');
    }
    
    return makeLargestSpecialHelper(s);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The recursive decomposition and concatenation make the time complexity somewhat complex to analyze exactly, but a rough estimate would be O(n log n).
  - **Reasoning:** The binary string is recursively processed and sorted at every level. Sorting `k` strings of length up to `n` at each level would lead to something akin to merge sort complexity, which is O(n log n).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - O(n) due to the recursion stack and storage of substrings.

This code provides an efficient solution to rearrange a special binary string into its largest lexicographical order by leveraging recursion and sorting.
