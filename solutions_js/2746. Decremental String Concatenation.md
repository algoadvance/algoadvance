[Leetcode 2746. Decremental String Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2746)
### Problem Statement
You're given an array of strings `words`. In one operation, select any word and remove a character from it. The resulting word must still be in the array. The goal is to determine the minimum possible length of the resulting concatenated string after performing any number of such operations.

Each `word` in the array consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at least one. The resulting string is formed by concatenating all the words in the array after making any number of deletions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the resulting string be empty?**
   - No, each `word` should still be identifiable in the array even after deletions.

2. **Is the length of the array `words` or the length of the words constrained in any way?**
   - Not specified; assume it can be large but manageable within typical problem constraints.

3. **Can we operate on the words simultaneously, or should the operations be sequential?**
   - The operations can be performed on any word at any time, independently.

### Strategy
To find the minimum possible length:
1. Utilize dynamic programming (DP) to explore all potential states of words.
2. Maintain a DP table where `dp[word]` represents the minimum length achieved when `word` is the last added word.
3. Use bit manipulation to represent subproblems efficiently, ensuring overlaps between words are handled optimally.
4. Iterate through combinations of words, finding minimal states by checking overlaps and updating the DP table accordingly.
5. Return the smallest value among the computed states.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
function minimizeConcatenatedLength(words) {
    const n = words.length;
    const dp = Array(n).fill().map(() => ({}));

    const overlap = (a, b) => {
        const minLen = Math.min(a.length, b.length);
        for (let i = minLen; i > 0; i--) {
            if (a.endsWith(b.substring(0, i))) return i;
        }
        return 0;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][1 << i] = words[i].length;
    }

    for (let mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) === 0) continue;

            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) !== 0) continue;

                const nextMask = mask | (1 << j);
                const curLength = dp[i][mask];
                const addedOverlap = overlap(words[i], words[j]);
                const newLength = curLength + words[j].length - addedOverlap;

                if (dp[j][nextMask] === undefined) {
                    dp[j][nextMask] = newLength;
                } else {
                    dp[j][nextMask] = Math.min(dp[j][nextMask], newLength);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let minLen = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dp[i][(1 << n) - 1] < minLen) {
            minLen = dp[i][(1 << n) - 1];
        }
    }

    return minLen;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of our approach is primarily determined by the DP update steps:
- There are `2^n` states (one for each possible subset of words).
- For each state, we check every pair of words, leading to `n^2` pairs.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(2^n \times n^2)\).

This method should be efficient for small to medium-sized inputs, making it suitable for typical competitive programming constraints.
