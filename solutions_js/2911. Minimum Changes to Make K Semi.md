[Leetcode 2911. Minimum Changes to Make K Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2911)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, your task is to return the minimum number of changes needed to be made in the string `s` such that the string can be divided into `k` parts, each of which is a semi-palindrome. A semi-palindrome is defined as a string that becomes a palindrome when any one of its characters is changed to any other character.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **String Length and Value Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the string `n` and the value of `k`?
2. **Character Set**: Are we only dealing with lowercase English letters or can the string contain uppercase, digits, or special characters?
3. **Semi-palindrome Definition** Clarification: Is it guaranteed that the string can be divided into exactly `k` semi-palindromes?

Let's assume the following constraints for now:
1. \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
2. \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
3. The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step-by-step:
1. **Divide the String**: We need to split the string `s` into `k` contiguous parts.
2. **Check for Semi-palindrome**: For each part, we check how many changes are required to make that part a semi-palindrome.
3. **Calculate Changes**: Summing up the changes required for each part to become a semi-palindrome will give the minimum number of changes for the whole string.

### Semi-palindrome Check Strategy
- For a string to be a semi-palindrome, you can change any single character to make it a palindrome.
- Identify the parts of the string that need changing to make them semi-palindromes and count the minimum changes required.

### Pseudo-code:
1. Split the string into \(k\) contiguous parts.
2. For each part, check how many characters need to be changed to make it either a semi-palindrome.
3. Track and sum up those changes across all parts.

### Plan

- Calculate the length of each part if possible.
- Traverse each part to find mismatches.
- For each part, make necessary changes to make it semi-palindrome.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minChangesToKSemiPalindromes(s, k) {
    const n = s.length;
    if (n % k !== 0) return -1;  // If k does not divide n evenly, return -1

    const partLength = n / k;

    // Helper function to find the minimum changes to make a substring a semi-palindrome
    function minChangesForSemiPalindrome(sub) {
        let left = 0, right = sub.length - 1;
        let mismatches = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            if (sub[left] !== sub[right]) {
                mismatches++;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        return Math.ceil(mismatches / 2);
    }

    let totalChanges = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i += partLength) {
        const substr = s.slice(i, i + partLength);
        totalChanges += minChangesForSemiPalindrome(substr);
    }

    return totalChanges;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "abacaba";
const k = 2;
console.log(minChangesToKSemiPalindromes(s, k));  // Output depends on the specific case
```

## Time Complexity

- Dividing the string into \(k\) parts: \(O(n)\)
- Checking each part for semi-palindrome:
  - Each check is \(O(\frac{n}{k})\)
  - For \(k\) parts, it's \(O(k \times \frac{n}{k}) = O(n)\)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

With these strategies and code implementation, you should be able to solve this problem efficiently.
