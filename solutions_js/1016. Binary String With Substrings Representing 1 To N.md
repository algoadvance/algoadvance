[Leetcode 1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1016)
### Problem Statement

We are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`. We need to determine if for every integer `x` from `1` to `n`, the binary representation of `x` is a substring of `s`.

**Constraints:**
1. `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= n <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Integer Range:** Do we consider each integer in the range `[1, n]` and check if their binary representation exists in string `s`?
   - Yes, that is correct.

2. **Binary Representation:** Should the binary representation consider any leading zeros?
   - No, leading zeros should not be considered in binary representation.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Each Integer:** For each integer `x` from `1` to `n`, convert it to its binary representation.
2. **Check if Substring Exists:** Check if the binary representation of each integer `x` is a substring within the given string `s`.
3. **Return Result:** If all binary representations are substrings of `s`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function queryString(s, n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let binaryRep = i.toString(2);
        if (!s.includes(binaryRep)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(queryString("0110", 3));  // Output: true
// console.log(queryString("0110", 4));  // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Representation Conversion (`toString(2)`):** This operation takes `O(log i)` time for each integer `i` due to base-2 conversion.
- **Substring Check (`includes`):** The `includes` method takes `O(|s|)` time in the worst case, where `|s|` is the length of string `s`.

Considering `n` values ranging from `1` to `n`:
- The overall time complexity is `O(n * (|s| + log n))`, where `|s|` is the length of the string `s` and `log n` is the maximum bit length of the binary representations.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively checks if all binary representations of numbers within the range `[1, n]` are present as substrings in `s`. While this approach is simple and works for the given constraints, be mindful of the potential performance bottlenecks with larger values of `n` due to repetitive string operations.
