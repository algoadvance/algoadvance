[Leetcode 1615. Maximal Network Rank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1615)
### Problem Statement

1615. Maximal Network Rank

You are given an integer `n`, the number of cities in a network, labeled from 0 to `n-1`. You are also given a 2D array `roads`, where each `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a_i` and `b_i`.

The **network rank** of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.

Return the **maximal network rank** of the entire network.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `2 <= n <= 100`
   - `0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
   - `roads[i].length == 2`
   - `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
   - `a_i != b_i`
   - Each pair of cities has at most one road directly connecting them.

2. **Output**: We need to return an integer representing the maximal network rank.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use an array `degree` of size `n` to store the number of roads each city is connected to.
   - Use a set `roadSet` to quickly determine if there is a direct road between two cities to avoid double counting.

2. **Populate Data Structures**:
   - Loop through the `roads` array, updating the `degree` array and filling the `roadSet`.

3. **Calculate Maximal Network Rank**:
   - Iterate through all pairs of cities (i, j) and calculate the network rank.
   - If there's a direct road between i and j, subtract one from the sum of their degrees to avoid double counting the road between them.

4. **Track the Maximum Rank**:
   - Keep track of the maximum network rank encountered during the iteration of pairs.

### Code

```javascript
function maximalNetworkRank(n, roads) {
    // Step 1: Initialize the data structures
    const degree = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const roadSet = new Set();

    // Step 2: Populate the degree array and roadSet
    roads.forEach(([a, b]) => {
        degree[a] += 1;
        degree[b] += 1;
        roadSet.add(`${Math.min(a, b)}-${Math.max(a, b)}`);
    });

    // Step 3: Calculate the maximal network rank
    let maxRank = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            let rank = degree[i] + degree[j];
            if (roadSet.has(`${i}-${j}`)) {
                rank -= 1;
            }
            maxRank = Math.max(maxRank, rank);
        }
    }

    return maxRank;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximalNetworkRank(4, [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]])); // Output: 4
console.log(maximalNetworkRank(5, [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[2,4]])); // Output: 5
console.log(maximalNetworkRank(8, [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[5,6],[5,7]])); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2). Here's how:

- **Step 1:** Initializing the `degree` array and `roadSet` takes O(1) for the array and O(m) for the set, where m is the length of `roads`.
- **Step 2:** Populating the `degree` array and `roadSet` takes O(m).
- **Step 3:** Calculating the maximal network rank involves iterating through all pairs of cities, which takes O(n^2).

Since m (the number of roads) is bounded by O(n^2), the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
