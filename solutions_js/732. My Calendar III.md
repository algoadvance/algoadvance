[Leetcode 732. My Calendar III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l732)
### Problem Statement

You are implementing a program to detect booking congestion. A booking is represented as a pair of integers `(start, end)`, both inclusive, representing the time of the booking.

Design a class `MyCalendarThree` to manage booking events. Implement the class to perform the following methods:

- `int book(int start, int end)`: Adds a booking from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and returns an integer representing the maximum number of concurrent bookings observed at any point in time.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are bookings inclusive or exclusive of `end` time?**
   - Bookings are considered inclusive of `end` time.

2. **Can `start` be equal to `end`?**
   - Yes, this would represent a booking that starts and ends at the same time.

3. **How large can the values of `start` and `end` be?**
   - The problem does not specify exact limits, but typically, you can assume they are large enough to need an efficient solution.

### Strategy

We will solve this problem using a line sweep algorithm with a difference array.

1. We will maintain a dictionary to keep track of the number of events starting and ending at each point in time.
2. For every booking event, we increment the count at the start time and decrement it at `end + 1`.
3. We then compute the maximum number of concurrent events by iterating through the sorted times and maintaining a running sum of the events.

### Code

```javascript
class MyCalendarThree {
    constructor() {
        this.timeline = new Map();
    }
    
    book(start, end) {
        if (!this.timeline.has(start)) this.timeline.set(start, 0);
        if (!this.timeline.has(end + 1)) this.timeline.set(end + 1, 0);
        
        this.timeline.set(start, this.timeline.get(start) + 1);
        this.timeline.set(end + 1, this.timeline.get(end + 1) - 1);
        
        let ongoing = 0;
        let maxConcurrent = 0;
        
        [...this.timeline.keys()].sort((a, b) => a - b).forEach(time => {
            ongoing += this.timeline.get(time);
            maxConcurrent = Math.max(maxConcurrent, ongoing);
        });
        
        return maxConcurrent;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize an instance of `MyCalendarThree` with an empty `timeline` using a `Map`.

2. **book Method**:
   - For a new booking from `start` to `end`, we:
     - Increment the count at `start` in `timeline`.
     - Decrement the count at `end + 1` in `timeline`.

   - We then calculate the maximum number of concurrent bookings:
     - We sort the keys of the `timeline`.
     - We iterate through the sorted keys, maintaining a running sum (`ongoing`) of start and end events.
     - We update `maxConcurrent` whenever `ongoing` exceeds the current `maxConcurrent`.

### Time Complexity

- **Add Booking**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of unique time points. Sorting the keys is the dominant step.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) to store time points and their counts.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently add bookings and calculate the maximum number of concurrent bookings at any given time.
