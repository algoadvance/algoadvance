[Leetcode 223. Rectangle Area](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l223)
## Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane. Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left and top-right corner coordinates.

Given the coordinates of the two rectangles in the following format:
- `ax1`, `ay1`, `ax2`, `ay2` for the first rectangle
- `bx1`, `by1`, `bx2`, `by2` for the second rectangle

Return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the coordinates guaranteed to be integers?**
   - Yes, the coordinates are given as integers.

2. **Can the rectangles overlap?**
   - Yes, the rectangles can overlap partially, completely, or not at all.

3. **Is it possible for the rectangles to have negative coordinates?**
   - Yes, they can have negative coordinates since they are integers.

4. **Should we consider edge cases like one rectangle completely inside another or rectangles having common edges?**
   - Yes, all such cases should be considered.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Area of Each Rectangle Individually:**
   - For Rectangle 1 and Rectangle 2, we use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is `(length * width)`.

2. **Determine the Overlapping Area:**
   - To find the overlapping area, determine the intersection points:
     - The left boundary of the overlap will be the max of the left boundaries of both rectangles.
     - The right boundary of the overlap will be the min of the right boundaries of both rectangles.
     - Similarly, the top and bottom boundaries are determined.
   - Compute the width and height of the overlapping area to get the area of the overlap.

3. **Combine the Areas Correctly:**
   - The total covered area is the sum of the two individual areas minus the overlapping area (if any).

## Code

```javascript
function computeArea(ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2, bx1, by1, bx2, by2) {
    // Calculate the area of the first rectangle
    const area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1);

    // Calculate the area of the second rectangle
    const area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);

    // Determine the boundaries of the overlap
    const overlapX1 = Math.max(ax1, bx1);
    const overlapY1 = Math.max(ay1, by1);
    const overlapX2 = Math.min(ax2, bx2);
    const overlapY2 = Math.min(ay2, by2);

    // Calculate the overlap area
    let overlapArea = 0;
    if (overlapX1 < overlapX2 && overlapY1 < overlapY2) {
        overlapArea = (overlapX2 - overlapX1) * (overlapY2 - overlapY1);
    }

    // Total area is the sum of both areas minus the overlap
    return area1 + area2 - overlapArea;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Calculations:**
  - Calculating the area for each rectangle is O(1).
  - Determining the overlapping area is O(1).
  - Total computations involve constant time operations.

- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(1)
  - The overall time complexity is O(1) since all operations are performed in constant time.
