[Leetcode 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2130)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list containing an even number of nodes. For example, the head node has the value `1`, the next node has the value `2`, and so on up to `n`. The Twin Sum of the linked list is defined as the sum of the values of the nodes at mirror positions from the start and the end, i.e., the sum of the 1st node’s value and the last node’s value, the sum of the 2nd node’s value and the second last node’s value, etc.

Your task is to return the maximum Twin Sum of the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the linked list?**
   - The length of the linked list is even, as stated in the problem.

2. **Can nodes contain negative values?**
   - No constraints on node values are specified, so we can assume nodes may contain any integer values, including negative numbers.

3. **How should the edge cases like having two nodes be handled?**
   - In such cases, the only available twin sum is their sum, so the solution should work for this minimum input case.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List:** We can use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the list.
2. **Reverse the Second Half of the List:** Once we find the middle, we can reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. **Compute the Twin Sums:** With the list split into two halves, we can traverse both halves simultaneously to compute and track the twin sums.
4. **Find the Maximum Twin Sum:** Keep track of the maximum twin sum encountered during the traversal.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

const pairSum = function(head) {
    // Step 1: Use fast and slow pointers to find the middle of the linked list
    let slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
    let prev = null, curr = slow;
    while (curr !== null) {
        let nextTemp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextTemp;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Traverse both halves of the linked list to compute twin sums
    let maxTwinSum = 0;
    let first = head, second = prev;
    while (second !== null) {
        maxTwinSum = Math.max(maxTwinSum, first.val + second.val);
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    return maxTwinSum;
};

// Helper function to create a linked list from an array
function arrayToList(arr) {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummyHead;
    for (let item of arr) {
        current.next = new ListNode(item);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return dummyHead.next;
}

// Example usage:
let head = arrayToList([5,4,2,1]);
console.log(pairSum(head)); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because:

1. Finding the middle of the linked list takes \(O(n/2) = O(n)\) time.
2. Reversing the second half of the linked list takes \(O(n/2) = O(n)\) time.
3. Traversing both halves to compute the twin sums takes \(O(n/2) = O(n)\) time.

Thus, the combined time complexity remains \(O(n)\). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are modifying the linked list in place without using extra space proportional to the input size.
