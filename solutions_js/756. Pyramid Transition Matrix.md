[Leetcode 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l756)
## Problem Statement

We are given a list of `allowed` triplets as strings. Each string represents a rule for creating the next level of a pyramid. The base of the pyramid is given as a string `bottom`. We need to determine if it is possible to build the pyramid to its tip according to the given rules.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]
Output: True

Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid with "BCD", then "CD", then "G", making the pyramid look like this:
    G
   CD
  BCD
```

**Constraints:**
- The length of the base (bottom) will be at most 8.
- `allowed` will contain at most 216 triplets.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the characters used in `bottom` and `allowed`?**
   - The characters are uppercase English letters ('A' to 'Z').

2. **Is there any fixed length for the allowed elements?**
   - Yes, each element in `allowed` is a triplet (a string of length 3).

3. **Should we account for every row having exactly one character less than the previous one?**
   - Yes, each upper layer in the pyramid should have exactly one character less than the layer below it.

4. **What should be returned if the pyramid can't be built?**
   - The function should return `False` if it's not possible to build the pyramid.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} bottom
 * @param {string[]} allowed
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var pyramidTransition = function(bottom, allowed) {
    const allowedMap = {};

    for (let triplet of allowed) {
        const base = triplet.slice(0, 2);
        if (!allowedMap[base]) {
            allowedMap[base] = [];
        }
        allowedMap[base].push(triplet[2]);
    }

    const canBuildPyramid = (current) => {
        if (current.length === 1) return true;

        const nextLevelOptions = (current) => {
            if (current.length === 1) return [[]];

            const options = [];
            for (let i = 0; i < current.length - 1; ++i) {
                const base = current.slice(i, i + 2);
                if (!allowedMap[base]) return [];

                if (options.length === 0) {
                    for (let ch of allowedMap[base]) {
                        options.push([ch]);
                    }
                } else {
                    const newOptions = [];
                    for (let option of options) {
                        for (let ch of allowedMap[base]) {
                            newOptions.push([...option, ch]);
                        }
                    }
                    options.push(...newOptions);
                }
            }

            return options;
        }

        const nextLevelList = nextLevelOptions(current);
        for (let next of nextLevelList) {
            if (canBuildPyramid(next.join(''))) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    return canBuildPyramid(bottom);
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Mapping Allowed Triplets**:
   - Create a map (dictionary) where each key is the first two characters of the triplet, and the value is a list of possible third characters that can form the next level.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Create a recursive function `canBuildPyramid` that attempts to build the pyramid layer by layer.
   - If the current layer has length 1, return `True` since we've successfully built the pyramid.

3. **Generate Next Level Options**:
   - For each pair of adjacent characters in the current level, check the `allowedMap` and generate all possible characters for the next level.

4. **Evaluate All Options**:
   - Try each possible combination of the next level generated from the current level recursively. If any combination leads to a successful pyramid, return `True`.

## Time Complexity

- Generating all possible combinations of levels can result in exponential complexity in terms of the depth of recursion. In the worst case, the time complexity is O(2^n), where n is the length of the base.

- Given the constraints (length of the base at most 8), this approach is feasible within the limits.
