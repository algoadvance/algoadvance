[Leetcode 3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3021)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game with a row of flowers, consisting of `n` flowers, where `n` is the length of the given string `colors`. Each character in the `colors` string can be 'A' (indicating a flower belongs to Alice), 'B' (indicating a flower belongs to Bob), or 'C' (indicating the flower is shared). Bob can count how many flowers bear his color but Alice does not care. The game ends when Bob can no longer count a flower of his color. 

You need to return `True` if Bob still has flowers to count, otherwise `False`.

### Input
- `colors`: A string consisting of characters 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

### Output
- Return `True` if Bob can count another flower, `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the returned value be case-sensitive?
   - Yes, the problem statement indicates characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' and they are case-sensitive.

2. Are there only three possible characters in the `colors` string?
   - Yes, per the problem description it will only include 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

3. Is it guaranteed that the string `colors` will always have a length > 0?
   - Yes, for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume `colors` is non-empty.

### Strategy

The task is to determine if there are any 'B' characters in the input string `colors`. Here's the plan:

1. Loop through the characters of the string.
2. Check if the character is 'B'.
3. If found, return `True` immediately.
4. If after checking all characters, no 'B' is found, return `False`.

This approach ensures linear time complexity \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string.

### Code

```javascript
var bobHasFlowers = function(colors) {
    for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
        if (colors[i] === 'B') {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};

// Example Usage:
console.log(bobHasFlowers("AABC"));  // Output: True
console.log(bobHasFlowers("AAAAC")); // Output: False
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `colors`. This is because we potentially check each character in the string once. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because no extra space is used other than a few variables for iteration.
