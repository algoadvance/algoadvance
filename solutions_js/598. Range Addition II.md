[Leetcode 598. Range Addition II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l598)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of `ops` where `ops[i] = [ai, bi]` means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all `0 <= x < ai` and `0 <= y < bi`.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `m` and `n`?**
   - m, n will be in the range of [1, 4 * 10^4].

2. **What are the constraints on the length of `ops` and the values within it?**
   - The length of `ops` will be between [1, 10^4].
   - Each `ops[i]` will have values [ai, bi] such that 1 <= ai <= m and 1 <= bi <= n.

3. **Can `ops` be empty?**
   - No, `ops` will contain at least one operation.

### Strategy

1. To identify the maximum integers in the matrix after all operations, we don't need to maintain the entire matrix. Instead:
    - The area that is incremented the most is defined by the smallest `ai` and `bi` from the operations.
    - The smallest `ai` and `bi` define a region `[0...min_ai, 0...min_bi]` that identifies the incremented region.
    - Thus, the number of maximum integers will be `min_ai * min_bi`.

2. Iterate through `ops` to determine the minimum `ai` and `bi`.

3. Return the product of the minimum `ai` and `bi`.

### Code

```javascript
var maxCount = function(m, n, ops) {
    // Initial values for the smallest ai and bi
    let min_a = m;
    let min_b = n;
    
    for (let op of ops) {
        min_a = Math.min(min_a, op[0]);
        min_b = Math.min(min_b, op[1]);
    }
    
    return min_a * min_b;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(k), where `k` is the number of operations in `ops`. This is because we are simply iterating through the list once to find the minimum values.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are using only a fixed amount of extra space.

This solution is efficient and optimal given the constraints.
