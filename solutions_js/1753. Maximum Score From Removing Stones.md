[Leetcode 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1753)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Each turn, you choose two different non-empty piles, remove one stone from each, and gain one point. The game ends when there are fewer than two non-empty piles.

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the maximum score you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` non-negative integers?**
    - Yes, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers.
2. **Is there an upper limit on the value of `a`, `b`, and `c`?**
    - No explicit upper limit is given in the problem.
3. **What should be the output if all three piles are zero from the start?**
    - If all three piles are zero, the maximum score is `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Observation**:
    - The strategy hinges on removing stones from the two largest piles to maximize the score.
    - The total number of operations that can be performed is limited by half the sum of all stones, i.e., `(a + b + c) // 2`.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
    - As long as there are at least two non-empty piles, select the two largest piles and remove one stone from each.
    - Continue until fewer than two piles have stones.

3. **Implementation**:
    - Sort the piles in descending order.
    - Repeatedly subtract one stone from the two largest piles and update the pile sizes.
    - Stop when fewer than two non-zero piles remain.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumScore(a, b, c) {
    // Array to store the sizes of the piles
    let piles = [a, b, c];

    let score = 0;

    // Continue until fewer than two piles have stones
    while (true) {
        // Sort the piles in descending order
        piles.sort((x, y) => y - x);

        // If the second largest pile is zero, we can't make a move
        if (piles[1] === 0) break;

        // Remove one stone from the two largest piles
        piles[0]--;
        piles[1]--;

        // Increment the score for each move
        score++;
    }

    return score;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step inside the loop is \(O(3 \log 3)\), which simplifies to \(O(1)\) because the number of piles is always 3.
- **While Loop**: The loop runs for at most \(\min(a + b, b + c, a + c)\) times, which is bounded by the sum of the piles divided by 2.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(\min(a, b, c))\), which simplifies to an efficient solution given the problem constraints.
