[Leetcode 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1298)
## Problem Statement

You have `n` boxes of candies. Each box is given in an array `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` represents the i-th box. Each box contains candies, but initially, some boxes may be locked.

You have a key to a box if you can open it. Initially, you start with some boxes, and you need to use them to find as many candies as possible. If you open a box, you get all the candies in it, and you may also find new keys to open other boxes and may find other new boxes inside those boxes you have opened.

Each box will have the following information:
- `status[i]`: an integer where `status[i] = 1` if the i-th box is open and `status[i] = 0` if the i-th box is closed.
- `candies[i]`: an integer representing the number of candies in the i-th box.
- `keys[i]`: an array of integers representing the indices of boxes you can unlock with the key inside this box.
- `containedBoxes[i]`: an array of integers representing the indices of boxes found inside this box.

Your goal is to calculate the maximum number of candies you can get following the rules described above.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input:
1. `status = [1,0,1,0]`
2. `candies = [7,5,6,4]`
3. `keys = [[],[],[1],[]]`
4. `containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]]`
5. `initialBoxes = [0]`

Output: 16

Explanation:
You will start with box 0, open it and get 7 candies, and also get boxes [1, 2]. This will also give you the key to box 1. You open box 2, get 6 candies, and find box 1. With the key to box 1, you open it and get 5 candies. You can open box 3 as well, but box 3 contains no candies.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can a box contain itself in the `containedBoxes`?  
   - No, that would create a recursive issue. Each box can contain other distinct boxes.
2. Is there any cyclic dependency in the boxes and keys?  
   - There should not be a cyclic dependency; theoretically all box indices are unique and disjoint.
3. Can we re-enter the same box after we find it again?  
   - No, we should handle each box only once â€“ either take candies from it or skip if it's already counted.

## Strategy
1. Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to simulate the process of opening boxes and obtaining candies and additional keys.
2. Track boxes which are `openable` and add candies from the boxes.
3. Use BFS to iterate over accessible boxes:
   - For each box, if it's open, add its candies to the result and check its contained boxes and keys.
   - Add the keys and contained boxes to respective sets to handle subsequently.
4. Maintain visited boxes to avoid reprocessing the same box.

## Code
This solution works by systematically applying a BFS approach, ensuring we process each box only once:

```javascript
const maxCandies = function(status, candies, keys, containedBoxes, initialBoxes) {
    let totalCandies = 0; // Total candies counter
    const openableBoxes = new Set(initialBoxes); // Track boxes we can open
    const boxesWeHave = new Set(initialBoxes); // Track all boxes we have found
    const queue = [...initialBoxes]; // Queue for BFS traversal
    const visited = new Array(status.length).fill(false); // Track visited boxes
    
    while (queue.length) {
        const box = queue.shift();
        if (visited[box]) continue; // Skip if already processed
        visited[box] = true; // Mark as visited

        if (status[box] === 1 || openableBoxes.has(box)) { // If it's open or we have the key
            totalCandies += candies[box]; // Add its candies to the total
            status[box] = 1; // Mark as open
            
            // Add contained boxes to the habit set
            for (const containedBox of containedBoxes[box]) {
                if (!visited[containedBox]) {
                    boxesWeHave.add(containedBox);
                    queue.push(containedBox);
                }
            }
            
            // Add new keys to openable set
            for (const key of keys[box]) {
                if (!visited[key]) {
                    openableBoxes.add(key);
                    if (boxesWeHave.has(key)) {
                        queue.push(key); // If we already have this box, process it
                    }
                }
            }
        } else {
            queue.push(box); // If it's closed, put it back in queue
        }
    }
    
    return totalCandies;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity would be **O(n)** since each box is processed at most once, where `n` is the total number of boxes.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to storage for sets and the BFS queue.
