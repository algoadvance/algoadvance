[Leetcode 70. Climbing Stairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l70)
## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
    - `n` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 45).

2. **What should be returned if `n` is 0?**
    - If `n` is 0, the only way to stay at the ground level (0 steps) is not climbing at all, which counts as 1 way.

3. **Do we count only unique sequences of steps?**
    - Yes, we want the total number of distinct sequences of steps to reach the top.

## Strategy

This problem is essentially about finding the number of ways to partition the staircase where you can go up 1 or 2 steps at a time. This kind of problem can usually be solved using dynamic programming.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Define the subproblem:**
    - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of distinct ways to reach the ith step.

2. **State the base cases:**
    - `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to stay at the ground, which is doing nothing)
    - `dp[1] = 1` (1 way to reach 1 step, which is a single 1-step move)

3. **State the recurrence relation:**
    - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`
        - If you are on step `i`, you could have arrived there from step `i-1` (which would be a 1-step move) or from step `i-2` (which would be a 2-step move).

4. **Compute the result:**
    - Using a loop, compute `dp[i]` for all steps from 2 to `n`.

### Code

```javascript
function climbStairs(n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    if (n === 1) return 1;

    let dp = new Array(n + 1);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — We only need to compute the value of `dp` array up to `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — We use an array of size `n+1` to store the computed values.

This approach is efficient for solving the problem within the given constraints (0 ≤ n ≤ 45).
