[Leetcode 587. Erect the Fence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l587)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the forest. Your task is to find the minimum fence that can enclose all the trees. The fence must be a convex polygon.

Return the vertices of the convex polygon in counter-clockwise order.

### Example:
Input: `trees = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]`
Output: `[[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]`

### Constraints:
- 1 <= trees.length <= 3000
- trees[i].length == 2
- 0 <= xi, yi <= 100

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are all the coordinates guaranteed to be unique for each tree?**
   - It's implied, but it's good to confirm because the solution may vary slightly with repeated coordinates.
2. **If multiple valid fences exist, is any valid solution acceptable?**
   - Typically, yes. But ensure confirming if there's an expectation of one specific result.

## Strategy

We will solve this problem using the **Graham Scan algorithm** to find the Convex Hull of a set of points. The steps are as follows:

1. **Find the starting point** (the point with the lowest y-coordinate, and in case of tie, the lowest x-coordinate).
2. **Sort the points** based on the polar angle with the starting point.
3. **Use a stack** to build the convex hull:
   - Iterate through the sorted points and maintain the invariant of the stack forming a convex polygon by checking and popping based on orientation.
   
### Orientation
To determine the orientation of the triplet (p, q, r):
- **Clockwise**: Return positive value
- **Counter-clockwise**: Return negative value
- **Collinear**: Return zero

## Code

Here's the implementation of the described approach in JavaScript:

```javascript
function outerTrees(trees) {
    const orientation = (p, q, r) => {
        return (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - q[0]) - (r[1] - q[1]) * (q[0] - p[0]);
    };

    if (trees.length <= 3) {
        return trees;
    }

    // 1. Find the starting point
    let start = trees[0];
    for (let point of trees) {
        if (point[1] < start[1] || (point[1] === start[1] && point[0] < start[0])) {
            start = point;
        }
    }

    // 2. Sort points by polar angle with `start`
    trees.sort((a, b) => {
        const o = orientation(start, a, b);
        if (o === 0) {
            return (Math.hypot(start[0] - a[0], start[1] - a[1]) - Math.hypot(start[0] - b[0], start[1] - b[1]));
        }
        return o < 0 ? -1 : 1;
    });

    // 3. Use a stack to maintain the convex hull
    const stack = [];
    for (let point of trees) {
        while (stack.length >= 2 && orientation(stack[stack.length - 2], stack[stack.length - 1], point) > 0) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        stack.push(point);
    }

    return stack;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(outerTrees([[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]])); // Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting** takes \(O(N \log N)\).
- **Stack operations** take \(O(N)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N \log N)** where \(N\) is the number of trees.
