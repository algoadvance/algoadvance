[Leetcode 1162. As Far from Land as Possible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1162)
## Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` grid containing only values `0` (water) and `1` (land), find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid contain only water or only land?**
   - Yes, in such cases, the result should be `-1` since there are no valid water-land pairs to measure the distance.

2. **What is the size limit of the grid?**
   - The problem constraints typically allow for large grids up to `100 x 100`.

3. **Is the grid always a square?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies an `n x n` grid.

## Strategy

This problem can be efficiently solved using a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize a Queue with Land Cells**:
    - Start by adding all the land cells (`1s`) to the queue.
  
2. **Perform Multi-source BFS**:
    - Conduct a BFS from all land cells simultaneously, spreading out to water cells (`0s`). Each water cell will be updated with its distance from the nearest land cell as the BFS progresses.

3. **Track the Maximum Distance**:
    - Maintain a variable to track the maximum distance encountered during the BFS.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - If there are no land cells or no water cells, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
var maxDistance = function(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    let queue = [];
    let hasLand = false, hasWater = false;

    // Step 1: Add all land cells to the queue and check if both land and water are present.
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                queue.push([i, j]);
                hasLand = true;
            } else {
                hasWater = true;
            }
        }
    }

    // If there's no land or no water, return -1
    if (!hasLand || !hasWater) return -1;

    // Directions for moving in the grid (top, right, bottom, left)
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    let distance = -1;

    // Step 2: Perform BFS
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        distance++;
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let [x, y] = queue.shift();
            for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
                let newX = x + dx, newY = y + dy;
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] === 0) {
                    grid[newX][newY] = 1; // Mark as visited by converting water to land
                    queue.push([newX, newY]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return distance;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` since we traverse each cell of the grid and perform BFS from all land cells.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is `O(n^2)` as well, primarily due to the queue storing all the cells and the grid.

This strategy ensures that the distance from each water cell to the nearest land cell is computed in an efficient manner.
