[Leetcode 3209. Number of Subarrays With AND Value of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3209)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers and a positive integer `k`, return the number of subarrays with an AND value equal to `k`.

The AND value of an array is defined as the bitwise AND of all the elements in the array.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays with an AND value of 1 are [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], and [1,2,3,4].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?** 
   - The constraints are typically within the limits of practical computation for an interview.
2. **Can the elements of `nums` be zero or negative?**
   - The problem states positive integers, so no zeros or negative values.
3. **How large can `k` be?**
   - Based on the context, `k` is a positive integer and within the same range as the values in `nums`.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Define a counter `count` to keep track of the number of valid subarrays.
2. **Sliding Window with AND Operator:**
   - Iterate over each starting position of subarray.
   - For each starting position, extend the subarray and compute the AND value until the AND result is less than `k`.
     - This is efficient because AND operation will only decrease or maintain the current value.

## Code

```javascript
function subarraysWithANDk(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let andValue = nums[i];
        for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            andValue &= nums[j];
            if (andValue < k) break;
            if (andValue == k) count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Outer Loop:** Runs `n` times where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Inner Loop:** In the worst case, also runs `n` times.
- **AND Operation:** Constant time.

Overall time complexity is O(n^2), which is reasonable for typical interview constraints.

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to zero to keep track of valid subarrays.
2. **Nested Loops:**
   - The outer loop selects each element as the starting point of a subarray.
   - The inner loop extends the subarray from the current starting point.
   - On each extension, we compute the AND value.
   - If the AND value is less than `k`, we break out of the loop early as extending further will not yield a valid subarray.
   - If the AND value equals `k`, we increment our counter.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently checking each subarray while breaking early when it is beneficial.
