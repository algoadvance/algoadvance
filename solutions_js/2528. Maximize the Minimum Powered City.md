[Leetcode 2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2528)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `stations` of length `n`, where `stations[i]` represents the power of the `i-th` city. You are also given an integer `r`, which represents the maximum reach within which a power station can boost its power. Specifically, if a power station is located at city `i`, it boosts the power of all cities within the range `[i-r, i+r]`.

Your task is to determine the maximum minimum power that can be achieved for all cities after boosting the power of the cities using additional power stations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the number of additional power stations that can be added?**
   - Yes, `k` additional power stations can be added.
   
2. **What are the constraints on `n`, `r`, and `k`?**
   - Typically, `n`, `r`, and `k` would have reasonably large constraints, as they affect the complexity of the solution. For this problem, assuming `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `0 ≤ r < n`, and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^5` would be common.
   
3. **What is the range of power that each power station can provide?**
   - It is typically within a range that won't result in overflow when performing calculations, e.g., `stations[i]` can be in the range from `0` to `10^9`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a binary search strategy to maximize the minimum power achievable by any city, given the constraints. Here's a step-by-step outline of the approach:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:** We initialize our binary search on the possible values of the minimum power that can be achieved. The initial range of search is from `0` to the maximum possible power boost achievable by assigning all additional stations to one city.
   
2. **Feasibility Check:** For each middle value (`mid`) of the binary search, we'll use a greedy approach to see if it's possible to achieve at least `mid` power for every city.
    - **Range Update:** Use a sliding window to update the power for each city and check if any city falls below `mid`.
    - **Additional Power Stations:** If a city falls below `mid`, add enough additional power stations to meet the requirement and ensure it's within the allowed range (`k`).

3. **Adjust Binary Search Range:** Depending on the result of the feasibility check, adjust the binary search range (`low` and `high`) until convergence.

### Code

```javascript
function maximizeMinimumPoweredCity(stations, r, k) {
    const n = stations.length;

    // Helper function to check feasibility
    function canAchieve(mid) {
        let additionalStations = k;
        let addedPower = new Array(n).fill(0);
        let currentBoost = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                currentBoost -= addedPower[i - 1];
            }
            if (stations[i] + currentBoost < mid) {
                let neededPower = mid - (stations[i] + currentBoost);
                additionalStations -= neededPower;
                if (additionalStations < 0) return false;

                currentBoost += neededPower;
                if (i + 2 * r + 1 < n) {
                    addedPower[i + 2 * r + 1] -= neededPower;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    // Perform binary search to maximize the minimum achievable power
    let low = 0;
    let high = Math.max(...stations) + k;
    let result = 0;

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (canAchieve(mid)) {
            result = mid;
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const stations = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const r = 1;
const k = 2;
console.log(maximizeMinimumPoweredCity(stations, r, k)); // Expected output: the max minimum power achievable
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The binary search performs `O(log(maxPower))` iterations.
- **Feasibility Check:** Each feasibility check runs in `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `stations` array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log(maxPower))`. This should be efficient for the given constraints.
