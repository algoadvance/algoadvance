[Leetcode 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2239)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the number in the array that is closest to zero. If there are multiple elements closest to zero, return the positive one.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [-4, -2, 1, 4, 8]`
- Output: `1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on the `nums` array size and values?
    - Can `nums` contain zero?
    - Are there any duplicate numbers in the array?
  
2. **Output Criteria:**
    - If the closest number to zero is equidistant from both positive and negative sides, should the positive number always be returned?

### General Constraints:
- The size of the array might range from 1 to \(10^4\).
- The elements of the array `nums` will be in the range of \([-10^5, 10^5]\).

## Strategy
1. **Initialize `closestNum`:**
   - Start with a large number to hold the closest number to zero.

2. **Iterate through the `nums` array:**
   - For each number, calculate the absolute distance from zero.
   - If this distance is less than the previous minimum distance, update `closestNum`.
   - If the distance is the same but the current number is positive (and the previous closest number isn't), update `closestNum` to the current number.

3. **Return `closestNum`:**
   - After iterating through the array, return the closest number to zero.

## Code

```javascript
var findClosestNumber = function(nums) {
    let closestNum = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (Math.abs(num) < Math.abs(closestNum)) {
            closestNum = num;
        } else if (Math.abs(num) === Math.abs(closestNum) && num > closestNum) {
            closestNum = num;
        }
    }
    
    return closestNum;
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [-4, -2, 1, 4, 8];
console.log(findClosestNumber(nums));  // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is looked at once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as no additional space proportional to the input size is used apart from a few variables.

Feel free to test the above function with different test cases to ensure its correctness.
