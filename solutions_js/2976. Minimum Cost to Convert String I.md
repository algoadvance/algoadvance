[Leetcode 2976. Minimum Cost to Convert String I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2976)
## Problem Statement

**Problem 2976**: Minimum Cost to Convert String

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You can convert string `s` into string `t` by either:
- Appending characters to the front of `s` (cost 1 per character)
- Removing characters from the front of `s` (cost 1 per character)

Return the minimum cost needed to convert `s` into `t`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are `s` and `t` guaranteed to be of the same length? 
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the strings or the characters they can contain?

Explanation and confirmation of additional constraints can help tailor the algorithm for edge cases such as very large strings.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's observe how the characters in `s` can be converted into `t`:
- We have the option to either append or remove characters at a cost of 1 per operation.
- We need to determine the minimal number of operations needed to transform each prefix of `s` into the corresponding prefix of `t`.

In formal terms, we'll work with a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to transform the first `i` characters of `s` into the first `j` characters of `t`.

**Steps to solve the problem:**

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s` and `t` respectively.
2. Fill in the base cases:
   - `dp[i][0]` (cost to convert the first `i` characters of `s` to an empty string) will be `i` (all characters in `s` must be removed).
   - `dp[0][j]` (cost to convert an empty string to the first `j` characters of `t`) will be `j` (all characters in `t` must be appended).
3. Use nested loops to fill in the rest of the `dp` matrix:
   - If the characters `s[i-1]` and `t[j-1]` are the same, no operation is needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the cost for:
     - Removing the character from `s`
     - Appending the character to `s`
     - Take the minimum of these costs.

## Code

```javascript
function minCostToConvertString(s, t) {
    const n = s.length;
    const m = t.length;
    
    // Initialize DP table
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(m + 1).fill(Infinity));
    
    // Base cases
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = i;  // cost to convert s[0..i-1] to an empty string
    }
    for (let j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = j;  // cost to convert an empty string to t[0..j-1]
    }
    
    // Fill DP table
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            if (s[i - 1] === t[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];  // No cost if characters match
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1, // Remove `s[i-1]`
                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1  // Append `t[j-1]`
                );
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][m];
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of strings `s` and `t` respectively. This is because we fill in an \(n \times m\) DP table with each cell potentially requiring a constant-time operation.

The space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the DP table used to store intermediate results.
