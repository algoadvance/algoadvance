[Leetcode 1748. Sum of Unique Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1748)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all the unique elements in the array.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,3], and the sum is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements, the sum is 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,2,3,4,5], and the sum is 15.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the range of values in the array?
   **A**: The values can be any integers within the valid range for 32-bit integers.

2. **Q**: Can the array contain negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Q**: What will be the length of the array?
   **A**: The length of the array can vary from 0 to 1000.

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. **Sum Unique Elements**: Iterate over the hash map and sum up the elements that have a count of 1.

### Code

```javascript
function sumOfUnique(nums) {
    // Step 1: Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element
    const freqMap = {};

    // Step 2: Populate the frequency map
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (freqMap[num]) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        } else {
            freqMap[num] = 1;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Sum up the elements that have a frequency of 1
    let sum = 0;
    for (let num in freqMap) {
        if (freqMap[num] === 1) {
            sum += parseInt(num); // convert string key to integer value
        }
    }

    return sum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we make one pass over the array to count the occurrences and another pass over the hash map to sum the unique elements.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the array, because we store counts for up to `n` different elements in the hash map.

By following this approach, we effectively count the unique elements and sum them in linear time.
