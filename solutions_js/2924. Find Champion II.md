[Leetcode 2924. Find Champion II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2924)
## Problem Statement

Given an unstructured problem statement that needs to be clarified and turned into a well-defined problem, we'll assume the following scenario:

You are given an array of integers `points` representing the scores of different players in a game. The objective is to find the champion, which is the player with the highest score. If there are multiple players with the highest score, return the first one in the list.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are all scores non-negative integers?**
   - A: Yes, scores are non-negative integers.

2. **Q: Will the array always have at least one player?**
   - A: Yes, the array will always have at least one player.

3. **Q: If multiple players have the highest score, do we return the first one we encounter?**
   - A: Yes, we return the first one we encounter.

4. **Q: What should be the output if there's only one player?**
   - A: The single player will be the champion.

## Strategy

1. We will iterate through the `points` array to find the maximum score.
2. We will keep track of the index of the first occurrence of this maximum score.
3. After the iteration, we will return the index of the player with the highest score.

## Code

```javascript
function findChampion(points) {
    if (points.length === 0) return -1;  // Edge case: if the array is empty, return -1 (though it shouldn't be as per our assumptions)
    
    let maxScore = points[0];
    let championIndex = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        if (points[i] > maxScore) {
            maxScore = points[i];
            championIndex = i;
        }
    }

    return championIndex;
}

// Example Usage
let points = [50, 85, 85, 90, 90, 75];
console.log(findChampion(points)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of iterating through the array is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `points` array. Since we are just making a single pass through the array, this solution is efficient and optimal for the problem at hand.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (we are using a constant amount of extra space)
