[Leetcode 1991. Find the Middle Index in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1991)
## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find the **middle index** (if any) such that the sum of the elements to the left of that index is equal to the sum of the elements to the right of that index. If there is no such index, return -1.

An index `i` is **middle** if `nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i-1]` is equal to `nums[i+1] + nums[i+2] + ... + nums[nums.length-1]`.

Note:

- `nums.length` will be in the range [1, 1000].
- `nums[i]` will be in the range [-1000, 1000].

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions that `nums[i]` will be in the range [-1000, 1000].
   
2. Is there a particular order that needs to be followed if multiple middle indices exist?
   - No, return the smallest index if there are multiple valid middle indices.

3. What should be returned if the array contains only one element?
   - In such a scenario, there won't be any elements to the left or right, so we should return -1.

## Strategy

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `leftSum` to 0.
3. Iterate through the array:
    - For each index `i`, calculate `rightSum` as `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
    - If `leftSum` equals `rightSum`, return `i`.
    - Update `leftSum` by adding `nums[i]`.
4. If no such index is found, return -1.

## Code

```javascript
function findMiddleIndex(nums) {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    let leftSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const rightSum = totalSum - leftSum - nums[i];
        if (leftSum === rightSum) {
            return i;
        }
        leftSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse the array twice: once to calculate the `totalSum` and once to find the middle index.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

This solution should be efficient even for the upper bounds of input size (length 1000).
