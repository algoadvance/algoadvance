[Leetcode 2834. Find the Minimum Possible Sum of a Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2834)
## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `n`. An array `nums` of size `n` is called beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. The elements of `nums` are distinct.
2. The elements of `nums` range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
3. The sum of any two distinct elements of `nums` is greater than or equal to `n+1`.

Find the minimum possible sum of a beautiful array of size `n`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if `nums` is already a beautiful array for a given `n`?
2. Is there any restriction on the types of values within the input array? Should it only deal with integer values?
3. What edge cases should be considered? For example, the smallest possible value of `n`?
4. Should the solution be optimized for time complexity?

## Strategy
Given the constraints and requirements, we need to ensure the following:
- All elements are distinct.
- Elements must belong to the range `[1, n]`.
- The sum of any two distinct elements is at least `n+1`.

Using the first `k` integers from `1` to `n` ensures that the sum of any two integers is large enough (at least `n+1` for the smallest pair and naturally larger for bigger integers). Here's a strategy:
1. Select numbers starting from `1` to `k` where `k` is the smallest such subset.
2. This will naturally minimize the sum, since the smallest numbers are added together.

This approach works because if you take numbers from `1` to `n`, and the array must maintain the distinct property, `[1, 2,..., n]` would automatically provide the smallest valid sum.

Given this simple strategy, let's move to implementation.

## Code
Here is the implementation of the plan in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumPossibleSum = function(n) {
    // Initialize the total sum to zero
    let sum = 0;

    // Iterate from 1 to n and accumulate the sum
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }

    // Return the minimum possible sum
    return sum;
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, which is efficient given that we only iterate through the numbers from `1` to `n` once.

This algorithm is not only easy to understand, but it is also optimal in terms of space, only utilizing a fixed amount of extra space (`O(1)`).
