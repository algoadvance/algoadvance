[Leetcode 2243. Calculate Digit Sum of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2243)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and an integer `k`. A round consists of transforming the string `s` by:

1. Dividing it into substrings of length `k`, where the last substring may be shorter than `k`.
2. Replacing each substring with the sum of its digits, which becomes the new string `s`.

Repeat the round until the length of `s` is less than or equal to `k`.

Your task is to return the final string.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "1111122222", k = 3
Output: "135"
Explanation: 
- For the first round: "1111122222" -> "111" "112" "222"
  "111" -> 1+1+1 = 3
  "112" -> 1+1+2 = 4
  "222" -> 2+2+2 = 6
  New string: "346"
- For the second round: "346" -> "346"
  Since "346" length is <= 3, we stop.
  Thus, the final string is "346".

```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string `s` contain non-digit characters?
   - No, `s` will only contain digits.
2. What would be the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - You can assume the length is reasonably large but within typical constraint sizes for coding challenges (e.g., up to \(10^5\) characters).
3. Should the result be returned as a string?
   - Yes, the result should be returned as a string.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with the given string `s`.
2. **Loop until termination condition is met:** Continue iterating while the length of `s` is greater than `k`.
3. **Divide and Sum:**
   - Divide the string `s` into consecutive substrings of length `k`.
   - Sum the digits within each substring.
   - Construct a new string from these sums.
4. **Update:** Set the new string as `s`.
5. **Termination:** When the length of `s` is less than or equal to `k`, stop and return `s`.

## Code

```javascript
function digitSum(s, k) {
    while (s.length > k) {
        let newString = "";
        for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i += k) {
            let substring = s.slice(i, i + k);
            let sum = 0;
            for (let char of substring) {
                sum += parseInt(char, 10);
            }
            newString += sum.toString();
        }
        s = newString;
    }
    return s;
}

// Example
console.log(digitSum("1111122222", 3)); // Output: "135"
```

## Time Complexity

- Let \( n \) be the length of the input string `s`.
- Each iteration through the string is proportional to the size of `s`, and within the loop, the string is being shortened. This is essentially forming logarithmic reductions.
- The overall time complexity can be approximated as \( O(n \log n) \), considering each reduction step forms a decreasing geometric progression in terms of string size.
