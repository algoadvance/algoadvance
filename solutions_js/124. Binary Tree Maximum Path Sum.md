[Leetcode 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l124)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum. 

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the nodes have negative values?**
   - Yes, the nodes can have negative values.
2. **Is there any constraint on the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree could be large, but you can assume that it fits within memory limits.
3. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the tree is non-empty.

### Strategy

1. **Define the Problem:**
   We need to find the maximum path sum in a binary tree. The path can start and end at any node, but must go through parent-child relationships.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   We'll use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. At each node, we need to calculate two values:
   - The maximum path sum **"through"** the current node including both children.
   - The maximum single path sum **"downward"** from the current node to any leaf (either through the left child or the right child).

3. **Step-by-Step Plan:**
   - Define a helper function that will recurse over the tree to calculate the sums.
   - At each node, compute the maximum path sum when considering paths that pass through the node and paths that go downwards through one of its children.
   - Use a global variable to keep track of the maximum path sum encountered.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single node trees.
   - Trees with negative values which can decrease the maximum path sum.
   
### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function maxPathSum(root) {
  let maxSum = -Infinity;

  function dfs(node) {
    if (node === null) return 0;

    // Recursively calculate the maximum sum on the left and right subtrees
    let leftMax = Math.max(dfs(node.left), 0);
    let rightMax = Math.max(dfs(node.right), 0);

    // Calculate the maximum path sum with the current node as the highest point (root of the path)
    let currentPathSum = node.val + leftMax + rightMax;

    // Update the global maximum path sum if the current path sum is greater
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentPathSum);

    // Return the maximum sum of the path going down from the current node
    return node.val + Math.max(leftMax, rightMax);
  }

  dfs(root);
  return maxSum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This complexity arises because each node is visited exactly once during the depth-first search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This space is used by the call stack during the depth-first traversal. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height could be n.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum path sum by leveraging a recursive DFS approach with a global variable to track the maximum path sum encountered during traversal.
