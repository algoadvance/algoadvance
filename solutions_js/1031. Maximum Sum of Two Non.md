[Leetcode 1031. Maximum Sum of Two Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1031)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `firstLen` and `secondLen`, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.

The subarrays must not overlap, and their lengths are exactly `firstLen` and `secondLen`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the integer elements in `nums`?
   - Is there a minimum or maximum size for the array?
   - Are `firstLen` and `secondLen` guaranteed to be valid such that they fit within the size of the array `nums`?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return a single integer representing the maximum sum?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take the following approach:

1. **Prefix Sum Array:** First, we create a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.
2. **Iterate through possible subarray placements:**
   - For each position, consider it as the end of the first subarray of length `firstLen`.
   - Calculate the sum of the first subarray using the prefix sum array.
   - For the remaining part of the array, calculate the sum of the second subarray which does not overlap with the first.
   - Repeat this process by considering the position as the end of the first subarray of length `secondLen`, and then finding the first subarray of length `firstLen`.

### Code

Here is the implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} firstLen
 * @param {number} secondLen
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSumTwoNoOverlap = function(nums, firstLen, secondLen) {
    // Helper function to create prefix sum array
    function buildPrefixSum(arr) {
        let prefixSum = new Array(arr.length + 1).fill(0);
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + arr[i];
        }
        return prefixSum;
    }

    const prefixSum = buildPrefixSum(nums);
    const n = nums.length;

    function maxSumHelper(L, M) {
        let maxL = 0; // Maximum sum of subarray of length L encountered so far
        let result = 0;
        
        for (let i = L + M; i <= n; i++) {
            maxL = Math.max(maxL, prefixSum[i - M] - prefixSum[i - M - L]);
            result = Math.max(result, maxL + (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[i - M]));
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    return Math.max(maxSumHelper(firstLen, secondLen), maxSumHelper(secondLen, firstLen));
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the prefix sum array takes **O(n)** time.
- The main logic runs through the array twice with potential **O(n)** operations inside it.
  
Thus, the total time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
