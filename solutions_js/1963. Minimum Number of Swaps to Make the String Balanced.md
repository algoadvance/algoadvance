[Leetcode 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1963)
## Problem Statement

1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced-out

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length consisting of only the characters `'['` and `']'`. A string is considered balanced if and only if:
- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as AB, where A and B are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.

You may swap any two characters in the string.

Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can change the string to "[][][]" by swapping index 0 with index 3 and index 1 with index 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can change the string to "[][]" by swapping index 0 with index 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Constraints on the length of `s`**:
    - Are all strings guaranteed to be of even length? (As stated in the problem, yes).
2. **Types of characters**: 
    - Are characters limited to only `[` and `]`? (Yes).
3. **Allowed operations**: 
    - Can we swap any two characters, or do swaps have to be adjacent? (Any two characters can be swapped).

## Strategy

We need to ensure that for every prefix of the string, the number of closing brackets `]` should not exceed the number of opening brackets `[`. To make the string balanced with the minimum swaps, we'll follow this strategy:

1. Traverse the string left to right:
    - Use a counter to keep track of the balance (initially set to 0).
    - Increment balance for each `[`.
    - Decrement balance for each `]`.
    - If at any point the balance goes negative (i.e., we have more `]` than `[` up to that point), we need to swap to fix this imbalance.
    
2. The imbalance indicates positions where there are fewer `[` than `]`. 
3. The minimum number of such imbalances gives the required number of swaps.

## Code

```javascript
function minSwaps(s) {
    let balance = 0;
    let maxImbalance = 0;
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '[') {
            balance++;
        } else {
            balance--;
        }
        if (balance < 0) {
            maxImbalance = Math.max(maxImbalance, Math.abs(balance));
        }
    }
    
    // Each swap can fix two imbalances
    return Math.ceil(maxImbalance / 2);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minSwaps("]]][[["));  // Output: 2
console.log(minSwaps("][]["));    // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

The provided algorithm traverses the string once and performs constant time operations for each character:

- **Traversal time**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Auxiliary space**: O(1) because we're using only a few integer variables to track the balance and maximum imbalance.

Therefore, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).
