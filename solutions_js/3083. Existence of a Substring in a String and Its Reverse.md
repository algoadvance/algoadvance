[Leetcode 3083. Existence of a Substring in a String and Its Reverse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3083)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, write a function to check if there exists any substring in `s1` that is equal to `s2` or its reverse.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - Strings `s1` and `s2` consist only of lowercase English letters.
   - The length of `s2` is less than or equal to the length of `s1`.

2. **Can `s2` be an empty string?**
   - For the sake of this problem, assume `s2` is non-empty.

3. **Should the function be case sensitive?**
   - No special case sensitivity is mentioned, so assume all lowercase.

4. **Can `s1` be an empty string?**
   - Given that `s2` is a substring of `s1`, `s1` cannot be empty unless `s2` is also empty. Since we assume `s2` is non-empty, `s1` will also be non-empty.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Substrings of Length `n` from `s1`:**
   - Loop through `s1` to find all substrings of length `n` (where `n` is the length of `s2`).

2. **Check for `s2` or Its Reverse:**
   - For each substring of `s1`, check if it matches `s2` or the reverse of `s2`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If any such substring is found, return `true`. If the loop completes without finding a match, return `false`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function checkSubstring(s1, s2) {
    let s2Reverse = s2.split('').reverse().join('');
    let n = s2.length;

    for (let i = 0; i <= s1.length - n; i++) {
        let substring = s1.substring(i, i + n);
        if (substring === s2 || substring === s2Reverse) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

// Test Cases
console.log(checkSubstring("abcdef", "abc")); // true, as "abc" is a substring
console.log(checkSubstring("abcdef", "cba")); // true, as "abc" reversed is "cba"
console.log(checkSubstring("abcdef", "ghi")); // false, no such substring
console.log(checkSubstring("abcdef", "fed")); // true, as "def" reversed is "fed"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Generating all substrings of length `n` from `s1` takes `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`.
  - Checking each substring against `s2` and its reverse is `O(2 * n)` for each substring, but this is negligible compared to the `O(m * n)` for substring generation.
  - We can simplify this to `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` due to storing the reverse of `s2`.
