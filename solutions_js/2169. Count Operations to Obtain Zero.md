[Leetcode 2169. Count Operations to Obtain Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2169)
### Problem Statement
You are given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, if `num1 >= num2`, you must subtract `num2` from `num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.

- For example, if `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 4`, subtract `num2` from `num1`, resulting in `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 4`.
- Similarly, if `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 5`, subtract `num1` from `num2`, resulting in `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 1`.

Your task is to return the number of operations required to make either `num1 = 0` or `num2 = 0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `num1` and `num2` be zero at the start?
   - Based on "non-negative integers" phrase, yes, they can be zero.
2. Should we consider an optimized approach for minimizing operations?

### Strategy
1. We will loop until either `num1` or `num2` becomes zero.
2. In each iteration, we'll check whether `num1 >= num2`:
   - If true, subtract `num2` from `num1`.
   - Otherwise, subtract `num1` from `num2`.
3. Increment the operation count in each iteration.
4. Return the count once the loop terminates.

### Code

```javascript
var countOperations = function(num1, num2) {
    let count = 0;
    
    while (num1 !== 0 && num2 !== 0) {
        if (num1 >= num2) {
            num1 -= num2;
        } else {
            num2 -= num1;
        }
        count++;
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(countOperations(5, 4)); // Output: 5
console.log(countOperations(4, 5)); // Output: 5
console.log(countOperations(0, 0)); // Output: 0
console.log(countOperations(10, 10)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(max(num1, num2))` since in the worst case, we may perform up to `max(num1, num2)` operations. Each operation reduces either `num1` or `num2`, ensuring progress towards termination.

- The while loop runs until the smaller of the two numbers is reduced to zero.
- Each subtraction reduces the size of the larger number by at least the value of the smaller number, which guarantees termination in finite steps.
