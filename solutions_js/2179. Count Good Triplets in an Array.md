[Leetcode 2179. Count Good Triplets in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2179)
## Problem Statement

You are given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and an array of positive integers `arr`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is called a good triplet if the following conditions are met:

1. `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
2. `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
3. `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
4. `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Return the number of good triplets.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be positive?**
   Yes, they are guaranteed to be positive integers.
   
2. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array `arr`?**
   The array size and value constraints will typically fall under common competitive programming limits (e.g., \(1 \leq \text{arr.length} \leq 10^3\)).

3. **What range can the values in the array `arr` take?**
   The problem typically allows values in `arr` to be positive integers within the range [1, 10^3].

## Strategy

To find the count of good triplets, we will follow these steps:

1. We will iterate over all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` such that `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`.
2. For each triplet, we will check if the conditions 
   - `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
   - `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
   - `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`
   are satisfied.
3. If all conditions for a triplet are met, we increment a counter.
4. Finally, return the counter as the result.

This brute-force approach is feasible given the constraint `1 \leq arr.length \leq 1000`, as it involves \(O(n^3)\) operations in the worst case, which is \(1000^3 = 10^9\), a reasonable complexity for this problem scale.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @param {number} c
 * @return {number}
 */
function countGoodTriplets(arr, a, b, c) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 2; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a) {
                for (let k = j + 1; k < arr.length; k++) {
                    if (Math.abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b && Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n^3)\) where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. This is because we have three nested loops iterating over the array to form all possible triplets of indices `(i, j, k)`.

- The outer loop runs \(n\) times.
- The second loop runs \(n-i-1\) times for each `i`.
- The innermost loop runs \(n-j-1\) times for each pair `(i, j)`.

Thus, the overall complexity is approximately \(O(n^3)\).

This complexity is manageable given the constraints mentioned in the problem.
