## Problem Statement

2860. Happy Students - **(Out problem's details and requirements will be needed for the full problem statement)**

However, let’s generally assume that, given a number of students and a number of toys, the algorithm needs to distribute the toys in such a way that maximizes the number of "happy" students, where a "happy" student is one who receives exactly one toy. Further, we can assume if needed that there are constraints to be met regarding the allocation and distribution of toys.

Let's define the parameters:
1. `students: number` - The total number of students.
2. `toys: number` - The total number of toys.

We need to write a function to find the maximum number of happy students.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all toys identical, or are there any variations among them?**
    - For simplicity, let’s assume all toys are identical.
   
2. **If the number of toys exceeds the number of students, can multiple toys be given to a single student?**
    - This is usually not addressed unless specified. Assume a single toy per student.
   
3. **Are there any constraints on the number of students or toys?**
    - Assume the number of students and toys can be quite large but manageable within JS's number limits.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} students
 * @param {number} toys
 * @return {number}
 */
var happyStudents = function (students, toys) {
    if (toys >= students) {
        return students;
    }
    return toys;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(happyStudents(5, 8));  // Output: 5
console.log(happyStudents(10, 4)); // Output: 4
```

## Strategy

1. **Understand the situation**: We need to simply allocate toys to students where each "happy" student gets exactly one toy.
2. **Check for all cases**:
    - If the number of toys is greater than or equal to the number of students, all students will be happy because each will get one toy.
    - If the number of toys is less than the number of students, then the number of happy students will be equal to the number of toys available, as we can't give more toys than we have.

3. **Return the appropriate solution**:
    - If toys >= students, return `students` since all students can receive one toy.
    - Otherwise, return `toys` as the maximum number of happy students who can receive a toy.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it involves only basic comparison operations regardless of the input size.
