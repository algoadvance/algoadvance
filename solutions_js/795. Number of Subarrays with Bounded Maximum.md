[Leetcode 795. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l795)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `left` and `right`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the value of the maximum element in the subarray is in the range `[left, right]`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 1, 4, 3], left = 2, right = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraint on array length:** Any constraints on how large `nums` can be?
2. **Boundary cases:** How should the function handle edge cases such as empty array `nums`?
3. **Range validity:** Can we assume `left <= right`?
4. **Data types:** Are all elements in `nums` guaranteed to be integers? Are `left` and `right` also integers?

We'll assume `nums.length` could be reasonably large, and we'll always have valid inputs if not specifically mentioned otherwise.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Start with three variables: `count` to keep track of the number of valid subarrays, `start` for marking the beginning of the subarray, and `last_below_left` which tracks the last position where we encountered a valid but too-small subarray.
2. **Traverse the Array:**
    - If `nums[i]` is within the range `[left, right]`, calculate possible subarray counts based on the current position relative to `last_below_left`.
    - If `nums[i]` is below `left`, use the position of the last below left to extend potential subarrays from previous valid subarrays.
    - If `nums[i]` is above `right`, reset the markers since no subarray containing this element can be valid.
3. **Add valid subarrays count to `count` throughout the iteration.**

## Code
Let's implement the strategy in JavaScript.

```javascript
var numSubarrayBoundedMax = function(nums, left, right) {
    let count = 0, start = -1, last_below_left = -1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > right) {
            start = i;
        }
        
        if (nums[i] >= left) {
            last_below_left = i;
        }
        
        count += (last_below_left - start);
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example Usage:
let nums = [2, 1, 4, 3];
let left = 2;
let right = 3;
console.log(numSubarrayBoundedMax(nums, left, right)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We achieve this efficiency because we only traverse the array once without nested loops. Each operation inside the loop is O(1).

This approach ensures we efficiently count all subarrays that satisfy the condition with a single pass through the input array.
