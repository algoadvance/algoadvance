[Leetcode 563. Binary Tree Tilt](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l563)
### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Sum of tilts = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all values in the binary tree integers?
   - Yes.
2. Can the nodes have negative values?
   - Yes.
3. Are there any node constraints, such as the maximum or minimum number of nodes or their values?
   - No specific constraints; the usual constraints for a binary tree apply.

### Strategy
1. We will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to recursively calculate the sum of all nodes in the left and right subtrees for each node.
2. Simultaneously, we will calculate the tilt of each node and add it to a cumulative tilt sum.
3. We will employ a helper function within our main function to return both the sum of subtree values and to update the cumulative tilt.
4. Finally, we will return the cumulative tilt sum.

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

function findTilt(root) {
  let totalTilt = 0;

  function calculateTiltAndSum(node) {
    if (node === null) {
      return 0;
    }

    // Recursively get sum of left and right subtrees
    const leftSum = calculateTiltAndSum(node.left);
    const rightSum = calculateTiltAndSum(node.right);

    // Node tilt is the absolute difference between left and right subtree sums
    const nodeTilt = Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum);

    // Add node tilt to total tilt
    totalTilt += nodeTilt;

    // Return sum of values of this subtree
    return node.val + leftSum + rightSum;
  }

  calculateTiltAndSum(root);
  return totalTilt;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the function call stack in the depth-first search, which, in the worst case (a skewed tree), could go as deep as the number of nodes (n). In a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).
