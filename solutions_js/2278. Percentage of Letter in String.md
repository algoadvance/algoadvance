[Leetcode 2278. Percentage of Letter in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2278)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a character `letter`, return the percentage of characters in the string `s` that are equal to `letter`. The percentage should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Length**: What are the constraints on the length of the input string `s`?
    - _Constraints confirm_: The length of `s` is between `1` and `100`.
2. **Character Set**: What character sets are allowed for `s` and `letter`?
    - _Constraints confirm_: Both `s` and `letter` consist of lowercase English letters.
3. **Output**: Can the percentage be 0?
    - _Constraints confirm_: Yes, if `letter` does not appear in `s`, the percentage should be `0`.

### Strategy
1. **Count Occurrences**: Iterate through the string `s` to count the number of times `letter` appears.
2. **Calculate Percentage**: Use the count and the length of `s` to calculate the percentage of `letter` in `s`.
3. **Round Down**: Use integer division to round down to the nearest integer.

### Code Implementation
```javascript
function percentageLetter(s, letter) {
    // Initialize count of letter
    let count = 0;
    
    // Iterate over string to count occurrences of letter
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === letter) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate percentage (automatically truncated towards zero in integer division)
    return Math.floor((count / s.length) * 100);
}

// Example usage:
const result = percentageLetter("foobar", 'o'); // should return 33
console.log(result);
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We are iterating through the entire string once to count the occurrences of `letter`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently calculates the percentage of a specific letter in a given string, ensuring that the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. This approach leverages basic string traversal and arithmetic operations to achieve the desired output.
