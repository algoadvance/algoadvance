[Leetcode 766. Toeplitz Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l766)
## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix, return  `true`  if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `false`.

A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

### Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

### Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/ex2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: false
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```

### Constraints:

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 20`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 99`

## Strategy

1. **Check Diagonals**:
   - We need to check that all elements on each diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) have the same value.
   - Start from the first row and the first column's elements and compare them with elements in their respective diagonals.

2. **Iterate Over Matrix**:
   - Iterate through the matrix elements. For each element at position `[i][j]`, ensure that it matches the element at position `[i-1][j-1]` if `i > 0` and `j > 0`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isToeplitzMatrix = function(matrix) {
    for (let i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] !== matrix[i-1][j-1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)` 
  - We are iterating through each element of the matrix, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - We are not using any extra space proportional to the input size, just a few variables for looping.

The provided solution checks each diagonal by comparing elements at `[i][j]` and `[i-1][j-1]` ensuring they are equal over the entire matrix. This efficiently ensures that the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix as per the problem constraints.
