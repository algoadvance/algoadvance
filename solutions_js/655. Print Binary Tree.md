[Leetcode 655. Print Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l655)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, construct a 2D string array to represent the binary tree. The height of the tree is `h`, the number of rows `m` should be `h + 1`, and the number of columns `n` should be `2^h - 1`. 

In the 2D representation of the tree, place the node values in the correct position within the grid. The position of node value at index 0 'root' should be at the center of the grid. For each node, its left child should be placed in the correct position to the left subtree rooted at its parent, meanwhile, its right child should be placed in the correct position to the right subtree rooted at its parent. If a node doesn't have a left or right child, then it will be empty.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Type**: What is the structure of the binary tree node?
    - Each tree node has an integer value or null with left and right child references.

2. **Output Type**: What should be the format of the output?
    - The output should be a 2D list of strings representing the tree.

3. **Null Values**: How should null or empty nodes be represented in the output?
    - Empty nodes should simply be represented as empty strings.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Height of the Tree**: 
    - Use a recursive function to determine the height of the given tree.

2. **Initialize the Grid**:
    - The grid will be of size `(h + 1) x (2^h - 1)`, filled with empty strings initially.

3. **Recursive Function to Place Values**:
    - Write a recursive function that places node values at the correct position. 
    - For a node at position (r, c), its left child will be at position (r + 1, c - offset) and its right child at position (r + 1, c + offset). The initial offset for the root node will be `(2^h - 1) / 2`.

### Code

Here is how you can implement the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

const printTree = (root) => {
    if (!root) return [];

    // Function to calculate the height of the tree
    const getHeight = (node) => {
        if (!node) return -1;
        return 1 + Math.max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right));
    };

    // Get the height of the tree
    const height = getHeight(root);
    const m = height + 1;
    const n = Math.pow(2, m) - 1;

    // Initialize the grid with empty strings
    const result = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(''));

    // Recursive function to populate the grid with node values
    const fill = (node, row, col, offset) => {
        if (!node) return;
        result[row][col] = node.val.toString();
        if (node.left) fill(node.left, row + 1, col - offset, Math.floor(offset / 2));
        if (node.right) fill(node.right, row + 1, col + offset, Math.floor(offset / 2));
    };

    // Start populating from the root
    const initialOffset = Math.floor((n - 1) / 2);
    fill(root, 0, initialOffset, Math.floor(initialOffset / 2));

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Height Calculation**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.
- **Grid Initialization**: O(m * n), which is essentially O(N) since the size of the grid is determined by the height and thus by the number of nodes.
- **Filling the Grid**: O(N), each node is processed once to place its value in the grid.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N).

This solution ensures that we properly calculate the height, initialize the grid, and fill it with the tree's node values correctly.
