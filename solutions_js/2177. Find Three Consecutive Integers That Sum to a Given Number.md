[Leetcode 2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2177)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `num`. You need to find three consecutive integers (x, x+1, x+2) that sum up to `num`. Return these integers in the form of an array `[x, x+1, x+2]`. If no such integers exist, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Negative Inputs**: Can `num` be negative? 
   - Yes, `num` can be negative.
   
2. **Range of Inputs**: What is the range of `num`?
   - The problem doesn't specify a range, but typically it's within bounds of standard integer values in JavaScript.

3. **Multiple Solutions**: Will there be multiple solutions possible?
   - No, since the problem states that we need to find three consecutive integers, there will be either one solution or none.

4. **Output Format**: Should the integers be returned in ascending order?
   - Yes, `[x, x+1, x+2]` implies that they should be returned in ascending order.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. Let's derive the equation from the problem statement. We're looking for three integers `x`, `x+1`, and `x+2` whose sum equals `num`.
   
   So, we have:
   \[
   x + (x+1) + (x+2) = num
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   3x + 3 = num
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   3x = num - 3
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   x = \frac{num - 3}{3}
   \]
   
2. We need to check if `(num - 3)` is divisible by `3`. If it is, `x` is an integer and thus the three consecutive integers can be found. If not, return an empty array.

### Code

Let's implement this logic in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sumOfThree(num) {
    if ((num - 3) % 3 !== 0) {
        return [];
    }
    
    const x = (num - 3) / 3;
    return [x, x + 1, x + 2];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**, as it involves only a fixed number of arithmetic operations and a single modular check. This makes the solution efficient for any integer value of `num`.

### Example Execution

1. For `num = 33`:
   - `(33 - 3) % 3 == 0` → `x = 30/3 = 10`
   - `Result: [10, 11, 12]`
   
2. For `num = 37`:
   - `(37 - 3) % 3 != 0` → `Result: []`

By following this strategy, we ensure both accuracy and efficiency.
