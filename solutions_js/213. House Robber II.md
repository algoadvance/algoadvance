[Leetcode 213. House Robber II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l213)
## Problem Statement

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, typically the constraint is `1 <= nums.length <= 100` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`.

2. **What should be returned if the list is empty?**
   - If `nums` is empty, the function should return `0`.

3. **What should be returned if there's only one house?**
   - If there is only one house, the function should return the amount in that house, `nums[0]`.

## Strategy

Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we cannot use the solution from the linear "House Robber" problem directly. The circular nature means we have two scenarios:
1. Rob houses from index `0` to `n-2` (excluding the last house).
2. Rob houses from index `1` to `n-1` (excluding the first house).

We'll compute the maximum loot for both scenarios separately using the `houseRob` helper function (which solves the linear "House Robber" problem using dynamic programming) and then return the maximum of these two results.

Here is the plan:
1. Create a helper function `houseRob` to handle the linear version of the problem.
2. Use the helper function to handle the two scenarios as described.
3. Return the maximum value obtained from the two scenarios.

## Code

```javascript
var rob = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return nums[0];
    
    // Helper function to solve the linear House Robber problem
    function houseRob(nums) {
        let prev = 0;
        let curr = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            let temp = Math.max(curr, prev + nums[i]);
            prev = curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
        return curr;
    }
    
    // Scenario 1: Rob houses from index 0 to n-2
    const max1 = houseRob(nums.slice(0, n - 1));
    
    // Scenario 2: Rob houses from index 1 to n-1
    const max2 = houseRob(nums.slice(1));
    
    // Return the maximum amount from both scenarios
    return Math.max(max1, max2);
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. Each scenario involves going through the houses list once.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the slicing operation creating new arrays. However, if we avoid slicing and use indices within the helper function, we can reduce the space complexity to `O(1)`.

By applying this approach, you can solve the "House Robber II" problem efficiently.
