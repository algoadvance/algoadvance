[Leetcode 328. Odd Even Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l328)
## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked list. The task is to group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and then return the reordered list.

Example:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What defines an "odd" and "even" index?**
   - We consider 1-based indexing, meaning the first node is considered at index 1 (odd), the second node is at index 2 (even), and so on.

2. **Are there any constraints on the number of nodes?**
   - Yes, typically the list should have at least one node and it wonâ€™t exceed the constraint limits usually given in linked list problems which can be very large.

3. **Do we need to handle the input being null or having just one node?**
   - Yes, for an empty list, return null. For a single-node list, return the head itself.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create two pointers: `oddHead` for keeping track of the first odd-indexed node and `evenHead` for the first even-indexed node.
   - Also, create two pointers `odd` and `even` to help in linking nodes. Initialize `odd` to the head and `even` to `head.next`.
   
2. **Traversal:**
   - Traverse through the entire list, adjusting the `next` pointers such that all odd-indexed nodes are linked together followed by even-indexed nodes.
   - Move `odd` pointer twice ahead after linking to the next odd node.
   - Move `even` pointer twice ahead after linking to the next even node.

3. **Merge Lists:**
   - Once the traversal is completed, link the last odd node to the head of the even list.

4. **Return:**
   - Return the head of the modified list.

## Code

```javascript
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

var oddEvenList = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;

    let odd = head;
    let even = head.next;
    let evenHead = even;
    
    while (even && even.next) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    
    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - We traverse each node exactly once to rearrange the pointers.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are not using any extra space that scales with input size, only a constant number of pointers.
  
This solution is efficient both in terms of time and space and should work well for typical constraint limits given in such problems.
