[Leetcode 3257. Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3257)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid with `m` rows and `n` columns, where each cell contains an integer value. Your task is to place three rooks on the grid such that the sum of values in the cells occupied by these three rooks is maximized. However, no two rooks can be placed in the same row or the same column. Return the maximum sum that can be obtained.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the grid can contain negative values.

2. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The grid can be of any dimensions as long as `m` and `n` are non-negative integers.

3. **If the grid dimension is less than 3x3 (e.g., 2x3 or 3x2), what should be done?**
   - In those cases, it's not possible to place three rooks per the constraints, so the problem becomes invalid.

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach**: 
   - Iterate through combinations of rows and combinations of columns.
   - For each combination, calculate the sum of the values at the intersections of those rows and columns.
   - Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

2. **Optimize with Preprocessing**:
   - Use combination generation from `m` rows and `n` columns.
   - Calculate matrix values at those intersections.
   - Track the maximum sum.

This problem fundamentally revolves around finding optimal combinations, so a brute-force combinatorial approach with some computational efficiency in selection should work given constraints are feasible.

## Time Complexity

- **Combinations Calculation**:
  - Generating combinations of rows and columns will take C(m,3)*C(n,3), where C is the binomial coefficient.
- Total time complexity would approximate O((m choose 3) * (n choose 3)) which is manageable for typical grid sizes in competitive programming but can be computationally intensive for larger grids.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
function getMaxSum(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    if (m < 3 || n < 3) {
        throw new Error("Grid is too small to place three rooks in different rows and columns.");
    }

    // Utility to generate combinations of `k` size from `arr`
    function generateCombinations(arr, k) {
        const result = [];
        const combination = (start, chosen) => {
            if (chosen.length === k) {
                result.push([...chosen]);
            } else {
                for (let i = start; i < arr.length; i++) {
                    chosen.push(arr[i]);
                    combination(i + 1, chosen);
                    chosen.pop();
                }
            }
        };
        combination(0, []);
        return result;
    }

    const rowIndices = Array.from({ length: m }, (_, i) => i);
    const colIndices = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);

    const rowCombinations = generateCombinations(rowIndices, 3);
    const colCombinations = generateCombinations(colIndices, 3);

    let maxSum = -Infinity;

    for (const rows of rowCombinations) {
        for (const cols of colCombinations) {
            const sum = grid[rows[0]][cols[0]]
                      + grid[rows[1]][cols[1]]
                      + grid[rows[2]][cols[2]];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 3, 4, 5],
    [4, 5, 6, 7],
    [6, 7, 8, 9]
];

console.log(getMaxSum(grid)); // Expected: 1 + 3 + 6 = 11
```

This solution comprehensively uses the combination method to check different possible positions for the rooks while respecting the constraints on row and column placements.
