[Leetcode 2120. Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2120)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2120: **Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid**

You are given an `n x n` grid and a robot initially located at position `(startRow, startColumn)`. The robot is tasked to execute a series of instructions represented by a string `s`. The instructions consist of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, `'U'`, and `'D'` which mean move left, right, up, and down, respectively.

The robot will attempt to execute every suffix of the string `s`, and you need to determine the number of valid moves it can execute from each suffix before moving outside the grid. A move is valid if the robot stays within the boundaries of the grid.

You need to return an array `results` of size `s.length` where `results[i]` is the number of valid moves the robot can execute starting from the ith instruction in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= n <= 500`
   - `s.length == m`
   - `1 <= m <= 500`
   - `0 <= startRow, startCol < n`
   - `s` contains only the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, `'U'`, and `'D'`

2. **Output:**
   - An array of integers where each integer represents the number of valid moves for each suffix in `s`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `s` is of length 1, only one entry in the output array.
   - If `startRow` and `startColumn` are at the corner of the grid and the instruction forces it out immediately.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `results` as an array of zeros with length equal to `s.length`.

2. **Direction Mapping:**
   - Map each of the directional instructions to their respective row and column changes: `L` to (-1, 0), `R` to (1, 0), `U` to (0, -1), `D` to (0, 1).

3. **Simulation:**
   - For each suffix starting at position `i` in `s`, simulate the robot's movement:
      - Initialize `currentRow` and `currentColumn` to `startRow` and `startColumn`.
      - For each character in the suffix, update the robot's position based on the direction.
      - Check boundaries; if the robot stays in bounds, increment the valid moves count for that suffix.

4. **Optimization Concerns:**
   - Each character might need to be processed up to `m` times, resulting in a total complexity of approximately `O(m^2)`. Since `m <= 500`, this is manageable but not optimal. Consider maintaining the state in a different way to avoid recalculations.

### Code

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} startRow
 * @param {number} startColumn
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var executeInstructions = function(n, startRow, startColumn, s) {
    const results = Array(s.length).fill(0);
    
    const directions = {
        'L': [0, -1],
        'R': [0, 1],
        'U': [-1, 0],
        'D': [1, 0]
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let validMoves = 0;
        let [currentRow, currentColumn] = [startRow, startColumn];
        
        for (let j = i; j < s.length; j++) {
            const [moveRow, moveCol] = directions[s[j]];
            currentRow += moveRow;
            currentColumn += moveCol;

            if (currentRow >= 0 && currentRow < n && currentColumn >= 0 && currentColumn < n) {
                validMoves++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        results[i] = validMoves;
    }

    return results;
};

// Example usage:
const n = 3;
const startRow = 0;
const startColumn = 1;
const s = "RRDDLU";
console.log(executeInstructions(n, startRow, startColumn, s)); // Output: [1, 5, 4, 3, 1, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity is **O(m^2)**, where `m` is the length of the string `s`. This results from the nested loops where each instruction in the suffix is processed.

- The space complexity is **O(m)** for storing the results array.
