[Leetcode 2456. Most Popular Video Creator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2456)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2456: "Most Popular Video Creator"

You have a list of video creators, the ids of their videos, and the number of views each video has received. Your task is to identify the creator with the highest total number of views, as well as the id of their most viewed video. If there are multiple creators with the same highest number of views, return all of them.

**Input:**
- `creators`: array<string> of video creator names.
- `videos`: array<string> of video ids.
- `views`: array<number> representing the number of views for each video.

Each element of the arrays `creators`, `videos`, and `views` corresponds to the same index.

**Output:**
- An array of arrays, where each sub-array contains the name of a creator and the id of their most viewed video.

### Example
```plaintext
Input:
creators = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Alice", "Bob"],
videos = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"],
views = [5, 10, 5, 8, 12]

Output:
[["Bob", "five"], ["Alice", "four"]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of input arrays?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems usually apply, e.g., 1 <= array length <= 10^5.

2. **Can more than one creator be the result if they have the same highest view count?**
   - Yes, include all such creators.

3. **What should be the criterion if multiple videos have the highest views for a creator?**
   - Return the smallest lexicographical video id.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structuring:**
   Create a map to store:
   - Total views per creator.
   - Another map to track the most viewed video id and its views per creator.

2. **Processing the Data:**
   Traverse through the `creators`, `videos`, and `views` simultaneously to populate the maps.

3. **Finding the result:**
   - Calculate the creator with the maximum views.
   - Traverse the map and form the result for creators having this maximum views.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation:

```javascript
function mostPopularCreator(creators, videos, views) {
    let creatorTotalViews = {};
    let creatorTopVideo = {};
    
    for (let i = 0; i < creators.length; i++) {
        const creator = creators[i];
        const video = videos[i];
        const view = views[i];
        
        // Update total views for the creator
        if (!creatorTotalViews[creator]) {
            creatorTotalViews[creator] = 0;
        }
        creatorTotalViews[creator] += view;
        
        // Update most viewed video for the creator
        if (!creatorTopVideo[creator] || 
            creatorTopVideo[creator].view < view || 
            (creatorTopVideo[creator].view === view && creatorTopVideo[creator].video > video)) {
            creatorTopVideo[creator] = { video, view };
        }
    }
    
    // Find the maximum total view count
    const maxViews = Math.max(...Object.values(creatorTotalViews));
    
    // Collect all creators who have the max total view count
    let result = [];
    for (let [creator, totalView] of Object.entries(creatorTotalViews)) {
        if (totalView === maxViews) {
            result.push([creator, creatorTopVideo[creator].video]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
console.log(mostPopularCreator(
    ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Alice", "Bob"],
    ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"],
    [5, 10, 5, 8, 12]
)); // [["Bob", "five"], ["Alice", "four"]]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Data Structuring and Processing (`O(n)`):**
   - Constructing the map takes linear time, where `n` is the length of input arrays.

2. **Finding the maximum views (`O(m)`):**
   - Where `m` is the number of unique creators.

3. **Total Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)` which simplifies to `O(n)` in most scenarios since the number of creators `m` will usually be significantly smaller compared to `n`.

The approach ensures efficient processing even for large inputs, making it suitable for typical constraint limits encountered in competitive programming.
