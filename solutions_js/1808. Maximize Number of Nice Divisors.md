[Leetcode 1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1808)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You need to maximize the number of nice divisors. A number is called a nice divisor if it can be obtained by multiplying exactly `primeFactors` number of primes (not necessarily distinct). You need to return the maximum number of nice divisors modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is `primeFactors`?**
   - `primeFactors` is a positive integer given as input, representing the number of prime numbers to be used in the multiplication.

2. **What do you mean by "multiplying exactly `primeFactors` number of primes"?**
   - It means we need to find a product consisting of exactly `primeFactors` prime numbers (which can be repeated).

3. **What is the range for `primeFactors`?**
   - The range for `primeFactors` isn't explicitly provided, but generally in coding problems, you can assume itâ€™s within the bounds that standard data types can handle unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy

To maximize the number of nice divisors, you should think in terms of mathematical properties. The key insight comes from properties of exponents and logarithms. Here's how you can approach the problem:

1. **General Insight**: The larger number of prime factors you can multiply, the larger the product becomes.
2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: For the maximum product, splitting the factors into the largest possible groups (especially into groups of 3) will give the highest values due to the properties of exponentiation. This is derived from mathematical optimization studies.

Hence, the steps are as follows:
- If `primeFactors` is less than or equal to 3, that's your simple base case.
- Otherwise, break `primeFactors` into as many groups of 3 as possible, and handle the remainder if it's 1 or 2.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
var maxNiceDivisors = function(primeFactors) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    
    if (primeFactors <= 3) {
        return primeFactors;
    }
    
    let quotient = Math.floor(primeFactors / 3);
    let remainder = primeFactors % 3;
    
    if (remainder == 0) {
        return fastPower(3, quotient, MOD);
    } else if (remainder == 1) {
        return (fastPower(3, quotient - 1, MOD) * 4) % MOD;
    } else {
        return (fastPower(3, quotient, MOD) * 2) % MOD;
    }
};

function fastPower(base, exponent, mod) {
    let result = 1;
    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exponent = Math.floor(exponent / 2);
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Base Cases**: If `primeFactors <= 3`, just return `primeFactors`.
- **Dividing Prime Factors**: For larger values:
  - Calculate how many full groups of 3 you can get (`quotient = Math.floor(primeFactors / 3)`).
  - Determine what's left (`remainder = primeFactors % 3`).
  - Handle these specific cases:
    - If `remainder == 0`, you can just use `3^quotient`.
    - If `remainder == 1`, it's optimal to combine it with one of the `3`s to make `4` (`3^(quotient-1) * 4`).
    - If `remainder == 2`, you can multiply it straight (`3^quotient * 2`).

### Time Complexity

- **Fast Power Function**: This implementation uses a logarithmic time complexity exponentiation by squaring which is `O(log n)]`.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is dominated by the fast power function which is `O(log primeFactors)`.

This efficient approach ensures you get the maximum product value while adhering to mathematical principles of optimal product division.
