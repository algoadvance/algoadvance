[Leetcode 169. Majority Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l169)
## Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 169: Majority Element

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the input array always has a majority element?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, the majority element always exists in the array.
2. What should be the output if the input array is empty?
   - This situation does not need to be handled because the problem constraints guarantee at least one element in the array.

## Strategy
There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Here, I will outline two common strategies:

1. **Hash Map / Frequency Counting**: 
   - Use a hash map to count the frequency of each element, then determine the majority element by checking which element has a count greater than `⌊n / 2⌋`.

2. **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**:
   - This is a more efficient method with a time complexity of `O(n)` and space complexity of `O(1)`. We will use this strategy for the final implementation.

### Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize two variables: `candidate` and `count`. Set `candidate` to `None` and `count` to `0`.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array:
   - If `count` is `0`, set `candidate` to `num`.
   - If `num` is equal to `candidate`, increment `count` by 1.
   - Otherwise, decrement `count` by 1.
3. After the loop, the `candidate` will be the majority element.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` because we are traversing the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
Here's how you can implement the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    let candidate = null;
    let count = 0;

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }
        count += (num === candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }

    return candidate;
};

// Example 1:
console.log(majorityElement([3,2,3])); // Output: 3

// Example 2:
console.log(majorityElement([2,2,1,1,1,2,2])); // Output: 2
```

This implementation ensures efficient determination of the majority element based on the expectation from the problem constraints.
