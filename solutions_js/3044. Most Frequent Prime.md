[Leetcode 3044. Most Frequent Prime](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3044)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`, and you need to return the integer that appears the most frequently among the prime numbers in the array. If there is a tie, return the smallest integer. If there are no prime numbers in the array, return `-1`.

### Example
- `Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,5,5,5,7]`
- `Output: 5`
- `Explanation: Prime numbers in the array are 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 7. The prime number 5 appears the most frequently.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input array length?**
    - The input array length can vary from 1 to 10^5.

2. **What is the range of the integer values in the `nums` array?**
    - The integers can vary from 0 to 10^5.

3. **Are there any constraints on memory usage?**
    - We should aspire to use a reasonable amount of memory given typical constraints for competitive coding (usually up to about 256 MB).

## Strategy
1. **Identify Prime Numbers:**
    - First, we need to identify which numbers in the given array are prime. We can precompute a list of prime numbers up to the maximum possible value using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

2. **Frequency Count:**
    - Count the frequency of each prime number in the array using a hash map (object).

3. **Determine Most Frequent Prime:**
    - Traverse through the hash map to find the prime number that appears most frequently. In case of a tie, the smallest prime should be returned.

4. **Handle Edge Cases:**
    - If no prime number is found, return `-1`.
    - Ensure the array is handled efficiently to conform to time complexity constraints.

## Code

### Step 1: Utility Function to Generate Prime Numbers
```javascript
function sieveOfEratosthenes(max) {
    let isPrime = new Array(max + 1).fill(true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(max); i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (let j = i * i; j <= max; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return isPrime;
}
```

### Step 2: Frequency Counter and Result Determination
```javascript
var mostFrequentPrime = function(nums) {
    const MAX_VAL = 100000;
    const isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(MAX_VAL);
    
    const freq = {};
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (isPrime[num]) {
            if (freq[num]) {
                freq[num]++;
            } else {
                freq[num] = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    let maxFreq = 0;
    let result = -1;
    for (const prime in freq) {
        if (freq[prime] > maxFreq || (freq[prime] === maxFreq && prime < result)) {
            maxFreq = freq[prime];
            result = parseInt(prime);
        }
    }
  
    return result;
};

// Example Usage:
// Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 7]
// Output: 5
console.log(mostFrequentPrime([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 7]));
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
    - Time Complexity: `O(n log(log n))`, where `n` is the maximum value in the array (here, `100000`).
2. **Frequency Count:**
    - Time Complexity: `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the `nums` array.

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
    - The overall complexity is `O(n log(log n)) + O(m)`, which is efficient for `nums` length up to `10^5` and value range up to `100000`.

This approach ensures that finding and processing prime numbers is conducted efficiently, adhering to problem constraints and typical coding interview environments.
