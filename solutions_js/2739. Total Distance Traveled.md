[Leetcode 2739. Total Distance Traveled](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2739)
## Problem Statement

You are driving a vehicle that moves at a constant speed. The vehicle has a feature where it automatically slows down when you have traveled a certain distance, every specific interval. Given the total distance you want to travel, the interval at which the vehicle slows down, and the percentage decrease in speed every interval, calculate the total time it will take to complete the journey. 

You are given the following parameters:
- `distance` (an integer): The total distance you need to travel.
- `interval` (an integer): The distance after which the vehicle slows down.
- `speed` (an integer): The initial speed of the vehicle.
- `decrease` (a percentage, an integer): The percentage decrease in speed after every interval.

Return the total time taken to travel the distance, rounded to two decimal places.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the speed decrease be applied after precisely every interval, or only at the end of completed intervals?
2. Does the speed decrease compound (e.g., does the speed decrease apply to the new speed after each interval)?
3. How precise should the calculation be regarding the time intervals and speed decreases?

## Code

```javascript
function totalTravelTime(distance, interval, speed, decrease) {
    let currentSpeed = speed;
    let totalTime = 0;
    let remainingDistance = distance;

    while (remainingDistance > 0) {
        const travelDistance = Math.min(interval, remainingDistance);
        totalTime += travelDistance / currentSpeed;
        remainingDistance -= travelDistance;

        if (remainingDistance > 0) {
            currentSpeed *= (1 - decrease / 100);
        }
    }

    return totalTime.toFixed(2);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(totalTravelTime(1000, 200, 100, 10));  // Example output
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - `currentSpeed` to track the current speed of the vehicle.
   - `totalTime` to track the total time taken.
   - `remainingDistance` to handle the distance yet to be traveled.
   
2. **Iterative Process**:
   - Use a while loop to continue traveling until the remaining distance is zero.
   - Calculate the actual distance to travel in the next step as the minimum of the interval and remaining distance.
   - Increment total time by the distance traveled divided by the current speed.
   - Decrease the remaining distance by the traveled distance.
   - If there's remaining distance, apply the speed decrease.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `interval` approximates the entire distance.
   - If the speed decrease leads to near zero or very minimal speeds (handle floating-point precision).

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(d / i), where `d` is the total distance and `i` is the interval. Each iteration simulates traveling one interval distance and updates the speed and remaining distance accordingly.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a fixed amount of additional space, irrespective of the input distance or interval.
