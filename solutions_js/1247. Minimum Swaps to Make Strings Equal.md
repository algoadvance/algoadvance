[Leetcode 1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1247)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length consisting only of characters `'x'` and `'y'`, you need to find the minimum number of swaps to make the two strings equal. A swap consists of choosing two indices (i, j) such that `s1[i] != s2[i]` and swapping `s1[i]` with `s2[j]`.

Return the minimum number of swaps required to make the strings equal, or return `-1` if it is not possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input strings `s1` and `s2` are always of the same length?**
   Yes, the problem specifies that the strings are of equal length.

2. **Are we only allowed to swap characters between `s1` and `s2` at the same index?**
   No, you can choose any indices `i` and `j` such that `s1[i] != s2[i]`.

3. **What is the definition of a swap?**
   A swap is swapping `s1[i]` with `s2[j]` for some indices `i`, `j`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Mismatched Positions**:
   - Traverse both strings and identify the positions where `s1[i] != s2[i]`.
   - Count the occurrences of `('x', 'y')` and `('y', 'x')` mismatches.

2. **Determine the Possibility of Making Strings Equal**:
   - Mismatches need to balance out: the total count of `('x', 'y')` and `('y', 'x')` must be even, as each swap fixes two mismatches.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Swaps**:
   - Each `('x', 'y')` and `('y', 'x')` pair can be fixed by one swap.
   - If there are an odd number of each type, we need one extra swap to make it even. Thus, add 2 additional swaps in this case.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumSwap(s1, s2) {
    let xy = 0; // To count 'x' in s1 and 'y' in s2 mismatches
    let yx = 0; // To count 'y' in s1 and 'x' in s2 mismatches

    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        if (s1[i] === 'x' && s2[i] === 'y') {
            xy++;
        } else if (s1[i] === 'y' && s2[i] === 'x') {
            yx++;
        }
    }

    // If the total number of mismatches is odd, it's impossible to solve
    if ((xy + yx) % 2 !== 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Number of swaps needed
    return Math.floor(xy / 2) + Math.floor(yx / 2) + 2 * (xy % 2); // 2 * (xy % 2) is either 0 or 2
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversing Strings**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Simple Calculations**: Constant time operations after traversal.

Thus, the time complexity is `O(n)`. This is efficient given that we need to examine each character in the strings.
