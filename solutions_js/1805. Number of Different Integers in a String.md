[Leetcode 1805. Number of Different Integers in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1805)
### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 1805: Number of Different Integers in a String**

You are given a string `word` consisting of digits and lowercase English letters.

You need to return the number of different integers in the string. An integer is a contiguous sequence of digits, which may contain leading zeros. However, the integers "0011" and "011" are considered the same because they both represent the integer 11.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are integers solely non-negative?**
   - Yes, as the problem mentions contiguous digits, and there's no sign specified.
   
2. **Can there be any other characters apart from digits and lowercase letters?**
   - No, the problem specifically mentions the string contains only digits and lowercase English letters.

3. **Are we interested in counting unique integers regardless of the format?**
   - Yes, "001" and "1" should both count as the integer 1.

### Strategy

1. **Extract all substrings of digits:**
   - Use regular expressions to find all contiguous sequences of digits in the string.

2. **Convert these substrings to integers:**
   - Remove leading zeros by converting the string of digits to a number.
   
3. **Collect unique integers:**
   - Use a `Set` to store unique integers found in the string.

4. **Return the size of the set:**
   - The number of unique integers corresponds to the size of the set.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to achieve the solution:

```javascript
var numDifferentIntegers = function(word) {
    // Use a regular expression to match sequences of digits
    let digitSequences = word.match(/\d+/g);
    
    if (!digitSequences) {
        return 0; // No digit sequences found
    }
    
    // Use a set to store unique integers
    let uniqueIntegers = new Set();
    
    // Process each digit sequence
    for (let sequence of digitSequences) {
        // Convert the sequence to an integer to remove leading zeros
        let number = BigInt(sequence); // Use BigInt to handle very large numbers
        uniqueIntegers.add(number.toString());
    }
    
    // Return the number of unique integers
    return uniqueIntegers.size;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(numDifferentIntegers("a123bc34d8ef34"));  // Output: 3
console.log(numDifferentIntegers("16727809320077b1123210300255840a50640a444")); // Example with large numbers
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be broken down into:
- **Regex Matching:** `O(N)` where `N` is the length of the input string. This retrieves all segments of digits.
- **Processing Sequences and Insertions into Set:** Each sequence conversion (considered `O(1)` due to constant average length of sequences in common cases) and insertion into the set (average `O(1)`).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string. This should be efficient for the typical length of input strings expected in such problems.
