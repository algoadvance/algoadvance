[Leetcode 2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2402)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [start[i], end[i]]` is the start and end times of the i-th meeting and an integer `n` which is the number of available meeting rooms. You need to return the number of meetings executed in the room that holds the most meetings. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the meeting times inclusive or exclusive?
2. Can meetings overlap?
3. Are the start and end times in the same day and in sorted order?
4. Do we need to account for any special cases like incorrect inputs or identical start and end times?

### Strategy
1. **Sort Meetings**: Sort the meetings by their start times.
2. **Min-Heap for Room End Times**: Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the end times of ongoing meetings in all rooms. This helps efficiently find the room that gets free the earliest.
3. **Assign Meetings to Rooms**: Iterate through each meeting and for each meeting, check if any room is free (i.e. the meeting in that room has ended). If a room is free, reuse it; otherwise, assign it to a new room.
4. **Count the Meetings per Room**: Maintain a list to count the number of meetings held in each room.
5. **Return the Maximum Count**: Finally, return the maximum in the list of counts.

### Code Implementation
```javascript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  // Method to return the top element of the min heap
  peek() {
    return this.heap[0];
  }

  // Method to insert a new element into the min heap
  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.bubbleUp();
  }

  // Method to remove the top element from the min heap
  extractMin() {
    if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
    const min = this.heap[0];
    this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
    this.bubbleDown();
    return min;
  }
  
  // Helper methods to maintain the heap property
  bubbleUp() {
    let index = this.heap.length - 1;
    const element = this.heap[index];
    while (index > 0) {
      let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
      let parent = this.heap[parentIndex];
      if (element >= parent) break;
      this.heap[index] = parent;
      this.heap[parentIndex] = element;
      index = parentIndex;
    }
  }
  
  bubbleDown() {
    let index = 0;
    const length = this.heap.length;
    const element = this.heap[0];
    while (true) {
      let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
      let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
      let leftChild, rightChild;
      let swap = null;
      
      if (leftChildIndex < length) {
        leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
        if (leftChild < element) swap = leftChildIndex;
      }
      if (rightChildIndex < length) {
        rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
        if ((swap === null && rightChild < element) || (swap !== null && rightChild < leftChild)) swap = rightChildIndex;
      }
      if (swap === null) break;
      this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
      this.heap[swap] = element;
      index = swap;
    }
  }
}

var mostMeetingRoom = function(meetings, n) {
  meetings.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  
  const roomEndTimes = new MinHeap();
  const roomCounts = new Array(n).fill(0);
  
  meetings.forEach(([start, end]) => {
    if (roomEndTimes.heap.length && roomEndTimes.peek() <= start) {
      const freeRoomIndex = roomEndTimes.extractMin();
      roomEndTimes.insert(end);
      roomCounts[freeRoomIndex]++;
    } else {
      roomEndTimes.insert(end);
      roomCounts[roomEndTimes.heap.length - 1]++;
    }
  });

  return Math.max(...roomCounts);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(mostMeetingRoom([[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5]], 2));  // Output will be the number of meetings in the room with the most meetings
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(m \log m)\) where \(m\) is the number of meetings.
- **Heap Operations**: Each insert and extract operation in the heap is \(O(\log n)\). Overall, iterating through all meetings will be \(O(m \log n)\).
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(m \log m + m \log n)\) where \(m\) is the number of meetings and \(n\) is the number of rooms.
