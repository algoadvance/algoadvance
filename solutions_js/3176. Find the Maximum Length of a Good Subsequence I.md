[Leetcode 3176. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3176)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you are asked to return the length of the longest good subsequence in `s`. A good subsequence of `s` is defined as a subsequence with no two consecutive characters '1'.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string `s` be empty?
   - No, the string is guaranteed to have at least one character.
   
2. Can the string `s` consist of only characters '0' and '1'?
   - Yes, the string is binary, containing only '0' and '1'.

3. What is the maximum possible length of the string `s`?
   - The constraint would typically be mentioned in the problem statement, but generally, let's assume it can go up to \(10^5\).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Iterate through the string while keeping track of the previous character.
   
2. **Construction of Good Subsequence**:
   - Use a variable to store the length of the good subsequence.
   - Initialize `prev_char` to `None` and `good_length` to 0.
   - As you iterate, if the current character is '0', it is always safe to include it. If it's '1', include it only if the `prev_char` was not '1'.
   - Update `prev_char` accordingly as you go.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The length of the good subsequence will be the answer.

### Code

```javascript
function findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(s) {
    let goodLength = 0;
    let prevChar = null;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            goodLength++;
            prevChar = '0';
        } else {
            if (prevChar !== '1') {
                goodLength++;
                prevChar = '1';
            }
        }
    }
  
    return goodLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\). The algorithm iterates through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). No additional space proportional to the input size is used, just a few integer variables.

### Example

```javascript
console.log(findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence("0110101")); // Output: 5
console.log(findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence("0000")); // Output: 4
console.log(findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence("1111")); // Output: 2
```

In the provided examples:
- `"0110101"` would have a good subsequence like `"01010"` or `"01101"` (length 5).
- `"0000"` is already good and its length is 4.
- `"1111"` has no two consecutive '1's except itself and can be reduced to `"11"` (length 2).
