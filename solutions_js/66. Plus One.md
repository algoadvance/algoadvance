[Leetcode 66. Plus One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l66)
### Problem Statement

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `i-th` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the input array be empty?
   - **A**: No, the input array will always contain at least one digit.

2. **Q**: Will there be any negative numbers in the array?
   - **A**: No, the array will contain only digits from 0 to 9.

3. **Q**: Do we need to handle any other symbols or characters in the array?
   - **A**: No, the array will only contain numeric digits.

4. **Q**: How large can the input array be?
   - **A**: The problem statement does not specify a maximum size, so you should assume it could be very large, but still feasible within memory constraints of a typical programming environment.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse from the end**: Start checking digits from the least significant digit (end of the array).
2. **Increment digit**: If the current digit is less than 9, increment it by one and return the array.
3. **Handle carry**: If the current digit is 9, change it to 0 and move to the next digit to the left. Continue this process until you either handle all 9's or there are no more digits left.
4. **Edge case**: If you finish processing all digits and resulted in a carry (e.g., all digits were 9), prepend a `1` to the array.

### Code

```javascript
function plusOne(digits) {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (digits[i] < 9) {
            digits[i] += 1;
            return digits;
        }
        digits[i] = 0;
    }
    
    // If we've gone through all digits and all were 9
    digits.unshift(1);
    return digits;
}

// Example usage
console.log(plusOne([1,2,3])); // [1,2,4]
console.log(plusOne([4,3,2,1])); // [4,3,2,2]
console.log(plusOne([9,9,9])); // [1,0,0,0]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, we might need to traverse all the digits (e.g., when all digits are 9).

The space complexity is **O(1)** if you don't account for the input and output array since we are doing the operation in place (except for using `.unshift`, which adds a digit to the front of the array, which could be considered O(n) in terms of additional space).
