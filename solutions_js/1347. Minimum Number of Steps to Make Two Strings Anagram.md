### Problem Statement

LeetCode 1347: Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

Given two equal-size strings `s` and `t`, you are tasked with making `t` an anagram of `s`. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. Specifically, you need to determine the minimum number of character changes required to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
    - Both strings `s` and `t` have the same length.
    - The strings consist of lowercase English letters only.
    
2. **Output requirements:**
    - Return a single integer representing the minimum number of changes needed.

3. **Can both strings be empty?**
    - According to the problem, this is unlikely since they are of equal size. If both are empty, trivially, 0 changes are needed.

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Frequency Count:**
    - Count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`.

2. **Difference Analysis:**
    - Compare the frequency counts to determine which characters and how many of each are in surplus or deficit in `t` compared to `s`.

3. **Calculate Changes:**
    - The minimum number of changes required to make `t` an anagram of `s` will be the total surplus characters in `t`.

### Plan

1. Create frequency maps for both strings.
2. Iterate through the frequency map of `s` and compare it with `t`'s frequency map.
3. Sum the absolute deficits to get the minimum number of steps required.

### Code

```javascript
function minSteps(s, t) {
    // Create frequency maps for both strings
    let freqS = new Array(26).fill(0);
    let freqT = new Array(26).fill(0);

    // Populate frequency counts
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        freqS[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
        freqT[t.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
    }

    // Calculate required changes
    let steps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (freqS[i] > freqT[i]) {
            steps += freqS[i] - freqT[i];
        }
    }

    return steps;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    - Where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. We make two passes through the strings to build the frequency maps, and one pass through the 26 possible characters.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
    - The space used by the frequency arrays is fixed (since they are of size 26 regardless of the input size).

This approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of steps to transform string `t` into an anagram of `s` by leveraging frequency counting.
