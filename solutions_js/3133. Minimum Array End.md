[Leetcode 3133. Minimum Array End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3133)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers, the goal is to remove elements from either the left or the right side of the array such that the remaining elements (if any) form a strictly increasing subsequence. You need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the array length?
   - What is the range of values for each element in the array?

2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum number of elements to be removed?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the array is already strictly increasing?
   - What if all elements are the same?
   - What if the array is empty or contains only one element?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of elements removed to get a strictly increasing subsequence:
1. **Identify the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**
   - Use a well-known method to find the LIS. This will give us the maximum number of elements that can form a strictly increasing subsequence.
   
2. **Compute the Minimum Removals:**
   - The minimum number of elements to be removed is the total number of elements minus the length of the LIS.

Here's the plan:
- Use a dynamic programming approach to determine the length of the LIS.
- Calculate the minimum number of removals as the difference between the length of the array and the length of the LIS.

### Code

```javascript
function minRemovalsToIncreasingSubsequence(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 1) return 0;

    // Dynamic Programming array to store the length of the LIS ending at each index
    let dp = Array(arr.length).fill(1);
    
    // Fill the dp array with LIS lengths
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The length of the longest increasing subsequence
    let lisLength = Math.max(...dp);
    
    // Minimum number of elements to be removed
    return arr.length - lisLength;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minRemovalsToIncreasingSubsequence([5, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4]));  // Output: 2
console.log(minRemovalsToIncreasingSubsequence([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));    // Output: 0
console.log(minRemovalsToIncreasingSubsequence([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]));    // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The provided solution involves a nested loop to compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), with a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. This is efficient enough for a reasonable range of input sizes, but for extremely large arrays, more advanced techniques (like binary search combined with dynamic programming, which operates in \(O(n \log n)\)) might be necessary.
