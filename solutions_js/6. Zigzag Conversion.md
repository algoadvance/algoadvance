[Leetcode 6. Zigzag Conversion](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l6)
### Problem Statement:

The "ZigZag Conversion" problem is defined as follows: 

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: 
~~~
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
~~~
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows.

**Example1:**
~~~
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
~~~

**Example2:**
~~~
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
~~~

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs, such as negative number of rows or empty string?**
   - For now, letâ€™s assume the inputs are valid as per the problem constraints.
   
2. **What should we do if `numRows` is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string?**
   - If `numRows` is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string, the zigzag pattern will be identical to the original string.

### Strategy:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `numRows` is 1 or `s` length is less than or equal to `numRows`, return the string unchanged.
   
2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use an array of strings to store characters for each row.
   
3. **Simulate the Zigzag Pattern**:
   - Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string.
   - Use a variable `curRow` to keep track of the current row and a flag `goingDown` to indicate direction.
   - Change direction when the first or last row is reached.
   
4. **Build the Result**:
   - Join all the strings in the array together to form the final result.

### Code:
```javascript
function convert(s, numRows) {
    if (numRows === 1 || s.length <= numRows) {
        return s;
    }
    
    const rows = Array(Math.min(numRows, s.length)).fill("");
    let curRow = 0;
    let goingDown = false;
    
    for (let char of s) {
        rows[curRow] += char;
        if (curRow === 0 || curRow === numRows - 1) {
            goingDown = !goingDown;
        }
        curRow += goingDown ? 1 : -1;
    }
    
    return rows.join("");
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3)); // Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
console.log(convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 4)); // Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the characters in the rows array.
