[Leetcode 1679. Max Number of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1679)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, your task is to count the maximum number of unique pairs (i, j) such that `nums[i] + nums[j] == k` and `i != j`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the elements in the array only positive integers, or can there be negative numbers as well?
   - **A:** The elements in the array can be any integer, including negative numbers.

2. **Q:** Can we use extra space for a hash map or any other data structure?
   - **A:** Yes, the use of extra space is allowed to solve the problem efficiently.

3. **Q:** Are duplicate pairs counted as distinct?
   - **A:** No, each pair (i, j) is unique and should only be counted once.

4. **Q:** What should be returned?
   - **A:** Return an integer representing the maximum number of pairs that sum up to `k`.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting and Two-Pointer Technique**: This is a classic approach to the two-sum problem when the task involves pairs and their aggregation to a target sum.
    - Sort the array to allow more efficient pair searching.
    - Use two pointers: one at the beginning (`left` pointer) and one at the end (`right` pointer) of the array.
    - Move the pointers towards each other based on the sum of the elements they point to.
    - If the sum matches `k`, increment the count and move both pointers inward.
    - If the sum is less than `k`, move the `left` pointer to increase the sum.
    - If the sum is greater than `k`, move the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.

2. **Hash Map Approach**: 
   - Use a hash map to store the frequency of each number in the array.
   - Iterate over the array, for each number calculate its complement (`k - number`).
   - Check if the complement is in the hash map and has a positive count.
   - If a valid pair is found, decrement the counts of both numbers in the hash map.

In this solution, we will use the Hash Map approach for O(n) time complexity.

## Code

```javascript
function maxOperations(nums, k) {
    let countMap = new Map();
    let maxPairs = 0;

    // Populate the hash map with frequency of each number
    for (const num of nums) {
        countMap.set(num, (countMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Iterate over the array to find pairs
    for (const num of nums) {
        let complement = k - num;

        if (countMap.get(num) > 0 && countMap.get(complement) > 0) {
            if (num === complement && countMap.get(num) < 2) {
                continue; // Skip if not enough pair
            }

            // We found a valid pair
            maxPairs++;
            countMap.set(num, countMap.get(num) - 1);
            countMap.set(complement, countMap.get(complement) - 1);
        }
    }

    return maxPairs;
}

// Example Usage
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let k = 5;
console.log(maxOperations(nums, k));  // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the array twice, once for populating the hash map and once for finding pairs.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We store the frequency of each element in a hash map.
