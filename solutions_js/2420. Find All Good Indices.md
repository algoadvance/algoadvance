[Leetcode 2420. Find All Good Indices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2420)
Sure, let's tackle the problem step-by-step. 

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `k` and `i`, we need to find all good indices `i`. An index is considered good if:

1. There is a subarray of length `i` starting from the current index which is strictly increasing.
2. There is a subarray of length `k` right before the current index which is strictly decreasing.

Write a function that returns all good indices.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we dive into coding, let's clarify the problem with some questions. 
1. Should the subarrays be strictly increasing or decreasing?
2. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
3. How large can the input array be? This will help us understand the constraints and the efficient algorithm we need to write.

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The values can be negative.
- The length of `nums` can be up to 100,000, so an optimal solution is preferred.
- The subarrays should be strictly increasing or decreasing.

### Strategy

To solve this:
1. We will traverse through the `nums` array and for each potential starting index, check the conditions for the good index.
2. First check if the preceding subarray of length `k` is strictly decreasing.
3. Then check if the succeeding subarray of length `i` is strictly increasing.
4. If the current index satisfies both conditions, add it to the result list.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function findAllGoodIndices(nums, k, i) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let result = [];
  
    // Check if the length of nums is less than required length for valid indices
    if (n < k + i) return result;
    
    for (let index = k; index < n - i + 1; index++) {
        let isValid = true;

        // Check strictly decreasing in previous k elements
        for (let j = index - k; j < index - 1; j++) {
            if (nums[j] <= nums[j + 1]) {
                isValid = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Check strictly increasing in next i elements if previous part was valid
        if (isValid) {
            for (let j = index; j < index + i - 1; j++) {
                if (nums[j] >= nums[j + 1]) {
                    isValid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        // Add to the result if valid
        if (isValid) {
            result.push(index);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let k = 5;
let i = 5;
console.log(findAllGoodIndices(nums, k, i));  // Example output: [5]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(n * (k + i)):
- For each index from `k` to `n- i` (looping over `n` elements), we are checking two conditions which take O(k) and O(i) respectively. 

The space complexity is O(1) for auxiliary space since we are only using the result array for storing the good indices.

### Summary

In summary, this approach systematically checks the conditions for each potential good index efficiently within the given constraints. The key is to ensure that the subarrays satisfy the required conditions without exceeding time limits, thereby ensuring optimal performance.
