[Leetcode 2612. Minimum Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2612)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` consisting of `n` elements, which are all either `0` or `1`. 

Your goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by reversing subarrays of size `k`. 

You can reverse a subarray (i.e., a `k`-length contiguous segment of the array) as many times as you want at different positions. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array sorted.

You are asked to implement the function:

```javascript
var minReverseOperations = function(arr, k) {
    // your code here
}
```

### Example

```javascript
Input: arr = [1,1,0,0,1,0], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can perform the following operations:
Reverse the subarray [1, 0, 0], the array becomes [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Reverse the subarray [0, 1, 1], the array becomes [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - We assume typical competitive programming constraints, say `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= n`.

2. **Are there guaranteed solutions for every input?**
   - Yes, we assume that there is always a solution.

3. **Can the subarray size `k` be equal to the length of the array `n`?**
   - Yes, it's possible. This means you can reverse the whole array.

4. **Is the array guaranteed to contain both `0`s and `1`s?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Treat the array as a graph where each state is a possible configuration of the array.
   - Use BFS to explore the minimal number of reversals needed to sort the array.
   - Each node in the graph corresponds to a state of the array, and an edge between nodes represents a reversal operation.
   - Maintain a queue to track current configurations and levels to count the number of reversals.

## Code

```javascript
var minReverseOperations = function(arr, k) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const target = Array.from(arr).sort((a, b) => a - b).join('');
    const start = arr.join('');
    
    if (start === target) return 0;
    
    let visited = new Set();
    let queue = [{ state: start, level: 0 }];
    visited.add(start);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let { state, level } = queue.shift();
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            let reversed = state.substring(0, i) + 
                           state.substring(i, i + k).split('').reverse().join('') + 
                           state.substring(i + k);
            if (reversed === target) return level + 1;
            if (!visited.has(reversed)) {
                visited.add(reversed);
                queue.push({ state: reversed, level: level + 1 });
            }
        }
    }
    return -1; // should never reach here since sorting is guaranteed
};

// Example usage
console.log(minReverseOperations([1,1,0,0,1,0], 3)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
  - Each state of the array can be viewed as a node in a graph.
  - Assuming there are approximately \(n!\) (factorial of `n`) possible states, accessing each needs to consider all possible subarray reversals.
  - BFS ensures each state is processed once, yielding exponential complexity in the worst case but is typically manageable within problem constraints.

Pointers:
- The solution involves transforming the array via graph traversal and recognizing that practical inputs constrain effective states to much less than \(n!\).
