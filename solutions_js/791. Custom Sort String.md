[Leetcode 791. Custom Sort String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l791)
Sure, let's walk through solving the LeetCode problem 791. Custom Sort String. Below is the approach we'll take to solve it:

### Problem Statement
You are given two strings order and s. All characters in order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously. Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if x occurs before y in order, then x should occur before y in the returned string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

**Example:**
```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"

Input: order = "exv", s = "xwvee"
Output: "eexvw"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all characters in `s` guaranteed to be present in `order`?
   - No, `s` can contain characters not present in `order`. Such characters should appear at the end of the result in any order.
2. Does the order string contain all the characters of the alphabet?
   - No, `order` may contain a subset of all possible characters.

### Strategy
1. Create a frequency map for the string `s`.
2. Construct the output by adding characters in the order specified by `order`.
3. Append the remaining characters that are not in `order`.

### Time Complexity
- Since we need to process each character in both `order` and `s`, the time complexity is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `order` and \(m\) is the length of `s`.

### Code
```javascript
function customSortString(order, s) {
    const freqMap = new Map();

    // Step 1: Generate frequency map for string `s`
    for (const char of s) {
        if (!freqMap.has(char)) {
            freqMap.set(char, 0);
        }
        freqMap.set(char, freqMap.get(char) + 1);
    }

    // Step 2: Build result string based on the 'order'
    let result = '';
    for (const char of order) {
        if (freqMap.has(char)) {
            for (let i = 0; i < freqMap.get(char); i++) {
                result += char;
            }
            freqMap.delete(char);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Add remaining characters not in 'order'
    for (const [char, count] of freqMap.entries()) {
        for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            result += char;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(customSortString("cba", "abcd")); // Output: "cbad"
console.log(customSortString("exv", "xwvee")); // Output: "eexvw"
```

In this code:
- We first build a frequency map for the characters in `s`.
- We then append characters in the order specified by `order` to the resulting string.
- Finally, we append any remaining characters that weren't specified in `order`.

This completes our solution. Be sure to test with diverse cases to ensure robustness.
