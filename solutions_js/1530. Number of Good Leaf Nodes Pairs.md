[Leetcode 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1530)
## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `distance`. A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of the shortest path between them is less than or equal to `distance`.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum number of nodes the tree can contain?
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.

2. What should we return if the tree has no good leaf node pairs?
   - You should return `0` if there are no good leaf node pairs.

3. What defines the distance between two nodes in this context?
   - The distance is defined as the number of edges in the path connecting two nodes.

## Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Perform a DFS to traverse all nodes of the tree.
2. **Distance Calculation:** Use a helper function to calculate distances from each leaf node to every other leaf node.
3. **Leaf Node Pairing:** Track the leaf nodes and their distances and count pairs that satisfy the condition.

### Approach:

1. **Recursive Postorder Traversal:** 
   - This will help in calculating the distance for each subtree.
   - Calculate distances from each leaf to other leaves within that subtree.

2. **Combining Results:**
   - Combine the results from the left and right subtrees to count the appropriate pairs.

### Code

```javascript
function countPairs(root, distance) {
    let result = 0;

    // Helper function to perform DFS and return the distances
    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return [];

        if (!node.left && !node.right) return [0]; // Leaf node
        
        const leftDistances = dfs(node.left);
        const rightDistances = dfs(node.right);

        // Check pairs between left and right distances
        for (let l of leftDistances) {
            for (let r of rightDistances) {
                if (l + r + 2 <= distance) {
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Return distances for the current node's children incremented by 1
        return [
            ...leftDistances.map(dist => dist + 1),
            ...rightDistances.map(dist => dist + 1)
        ];
    }

    dfs(root);
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

- **DFS Traversal:** The `dfs` function traverses the tree in postorder.
- **Leaf Node Detection:** Leaf nodes return `[0]` because their distance to themselves is zero.
- **Distance Combination:** Each internal node will combine the distances of left and right subtree distances, incrementing them by 1 each to account for the current node.
- **Pair Counting:** The nested loops check all combinations of left and right distances for validity against the threshold `distance`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N^2) \) in the worst case because for each node, we might be performing operations on distances which can consume extra time.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(N) \), due to the recursion stack and the space required to store distances.

This approach ensures that we count all pairs of leaf nodes whose paths are within the specified `distance`, maintaining efficiency and clarity.
