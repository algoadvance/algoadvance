[Leetcode 3245. Alternating Groups III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3245)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `str` and an integer `k`. You need to reverse the characters of the string such that every `k` characters form a group and the groups themselves switch their order (reversing their sequence). If the number of characters in the last group is less than `k`, complete it without modification.

For example:

- Input: `str="abcdefg", k=2`
- Output: `str="gfcdeb"`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be done for edge cases like an empty string or `k` greater than the length of the string?**
   - For an empty string, the output should be an empty string.
   - If `k` is greater than the length of the string, the output should be the reversed string.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `k` or the length of the string?**
   - Assume `1 <= k <= 10000` and the length of the string is up to `10^5`.

### Strategy:

1. **Group the String:** Divide the string into contiguous segments of length `k`.
2. **Reverse Groups:** Store these groups in an array.
3. **Reverse the Order of Groups:** Reverse the order of the segments in the array.
4. **Concatenate and Return:** Join these segments to form the final string.

### Code:

Let's implement this step-by-step.

```javascript
function reverseAlternatingGroups(str, k) {
    if (str.length === 0) return "";

    // Step 1: Create an array to hold segments of length k
    let segments = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i += k) {
        segments.push(str.substring(i, i + k));
    }

    // Step 2: Reverse the order of the segments
    segments.reverse();

    // Step 3: Join the segments to form the final string
    return segments.join('');
}

// Example usage:
const str = "abcdefg";
const k = 2;
console.log(reverseAlternatingGroups(str, k)); 
// Expected output: "gfdcabe"
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Group Creation:** Creating groups and pushing them into an array takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- **Reversal of Groups:** Reversing the groups takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of groups (approximately \( n/k \)).
- **Concatenation:** Joining the segments into a final string takes \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\). This solution efficiently handles even large strings within the given constraints.
