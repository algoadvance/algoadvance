[Leetcode 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1338)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array `arr`. We need to determine the minimum size of a set of integers you need to remove from the array such that at least half of the elements are removed.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The set of integers {3, 5} will remove 8 elements and leave 2 elements in the array.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size of the array?**
   - This helps in understanding the constraints and performance requirements.
   
2. **Are the integers in the array within any specific range?**
   - This will help us understand if we need to handle any edge cases related to integer overflow.
   
3. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - It's useful to know if the solution needs special handling for negative numbers.

### Observations

- We need to remove elements such that the remaining elements are <= half of the original array.
- The elements to be removed should be the ones with the highest frequency first to minimize the set size.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each integer in the array.

2. **Sorting by Frequency:**
   - Create an array of the frequencies, then sort this array in descending order.

3. **Greedy Removal:**
   - Remove elements starting from the highest frequency count until we've removed at least half of the total elements.

### Code

```javascript
function minSetSize(arr) {
    // Step 1: Frequency counting
    let frequencyMap = new Map();
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (frequencyMap.has(num)) {
            frequencyMap.set(num, frequencyMap.get(num) + 1);
        } else {
            frequencyMap.set(num, 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Sort frequencies in descending order
    let frequencies = [...frequencyMap.values()];
    frequencies.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Step 3: Greedy removal
    let removedElements = 0;
    let setSize = 0;
    let halfSize = Math.ceil(arr.length / 2);
    
    for (let freq of frequencies) {
        removedElements += freq;
        setSize++;
        if (removedElements >= halfSize) {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return setSize;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Counting:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Sorting Frequencies:** O(k log k), where k is the number of unique elements (k <= n).
3. **Greedy Removal:** O(k), where k is the number of unique elements.

Overall time complexity is O(n + k log k), which is efficient given that k <= n.

### Example

Using the provided example:
```javascript
let arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7];
console.log(minSetSize(arr));  // Output: 2
```

The most frequent numbers are 3 and 5. Removing instances of these two numbers reduces the size of the array to be less than or equal to half its original size.
