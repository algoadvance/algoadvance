[Leetcode 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1365)
Certainly! Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Problem Statement

You're given an array `nums` where each element represents a number. For each element in the array, determine how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. The result should be returned as an array where each element corresponds to the count of numbers smaller than the number at the same index in the input array.

### Example
**Input:** `nums = [8, 1, 2, 2, 3]`  
**Output:** `[4, 0, 1, 1, 3]`  
**Explanation:** 
- For `8`, there are `4` numbers smaller than it: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
- For `1`, there are `0` numbers smaller than it.
- For one of the `2`s, there is `1` number smaller than it: `[1]`
- For the other `2`, similarly, there is `1` number smaller than it: `[1]`
- For `3`, there are `3` numbers smaller than it: `[1, 2, 2]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the elements in the input array guaranteed to be integers?
2. Can there be negative integers in the input array?
3. What is the range of the array length and element values?

Assumption: The input array contains integers, and the length of the array as well as the values are within a reasonable range for typical competitive programming (e.g., array length up to 10^5 and integer values within the range of standard 32-bit integers).

### Strategy

1. **Naive Approach:**
   - For each element in the array, count how many elements are smaller by iterating through the entire array. This results in an \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
   - This approach can be inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Sort the array while keeping track of the original indices. This allows us to determine the ranks of each element.
   - Create a result array where we will store the counts of numbers smaller than each element by leveraging the sorted array's order.
   - Use a dictionary to store the first occurrence of each element in the sorted list, which helps in achieving better time complexity.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the optimal approach in JavaScript:

```javascript
var smallerNumbersThanCurrent = function(nums) {
    // Create a copy of the original array and sort it
    let sortedNums = [...nums].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Dictionary to store the first occurrence index of each element in sorted array
    let numToIndex = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedNums.length; i++) {
        // Ensure we only set the index once, which captures the first occurrence
        if (numToIndex[sortedNums[i]] === undefined) {
            numToIndex[sortedNums[i]] = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Create the result array by mapping the original elements to their first occurrence index
    return nums.map(num => numToIndex[num]);
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [8, 1, 2, 2, 3];
console.log(smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums)); // Output: [4, 0, 1, 1, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Creating dictionary for first occurrences:** \(O(n)\)
- **Mapping the original array to result:** \(O(n)\)

Therefore, the total time complexity should be \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient and suitable for large arrays.
