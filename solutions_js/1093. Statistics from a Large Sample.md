[Leetcode 1093. Statistics from a Large Sample](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1093)
### Problem Statement

You are given a large sample of integers in the range `[0, 255]`. Since the sample is so large, it can be represented by a histogram, where `count[i]` is the number of times that `i` appears in the sample. For example, `count[0]` is the number of times `0` appears, `count[1]` is the number of times `1` appears, and so on.

Calculate the following statistics:

1. Minimum value.
2. Maximum value.
3. Mean (average).
4. Median.
5. Mode (the value with the highest frequency, and, if there are multiple values with the highest frequency, return the smallest one).

Return the statistics as an array of the format:
`[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Length of `count` is fixed at 256 (i.e., exactly one entry for each integer from 0 to 255).
   - Each value in `count` is a non-negative integer.
   - `count` can have a maximum length where each entry counts billions of occurrences.

2. **Clarifications for Outputs:**
   - Mean should be a floating-point value with enough precision.
   - Median for even length should be the average of the two central elements.

### Strategy

To calculate the required statistics, you need to do the following:

1. **Calculate Minimum and Maximum:** These can be directly derived from the `count` array.
2. **Calculate Mean:** The mean is the sum of all values times their frequencies divided by the sum of the frequencies.
3. **Calculate Median:** Median is the middle value when the values are ordered. Depending on the number of elements (even or odd), this might be a single middle value or the average of two middle values.
4. **Calculate Mode:** The mode is the value with the highest frequency.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n)`, where n is the fixed size 256, because we will iterate through the `count` array a few times to determine the statistics.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sampleStats(count) {
    let minimum = -1, maximum = -1;
    let total = 0, numberSum = 0, maxCount = 0, mode = 0;
    let n = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        if (count[i] > 0) {
            if (minimum === -1) minimum = i;
            maximum = i;
            if (count[i] > maxCount) {
                maxCount = count[i];
                mode = i;
            }
            numberSum += i * count[i];
            n += count[i];
        }
        total += count[i];
    }

    const mean = numberSum / n;

    let median1 = 0, median2 = 0;
    let mid1 = Math.floor((n - 1) / 2), mid2 = Math.floor(n / 2); 
    let cumulativeCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        if (count[i] > 0) {
            cumulativeCount += count[i];
            if (cumulativeCount > mid1 && median1 === 0) {
                median1 = i;
            }
            if (cumulativeCount > mid2) {
                median2 = i;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    const median = (median1 + median2) / 2;

    return [minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Minimum & Maximum:** Loop through the count array and determine the first and last non-zero indices to get the minimum and maximum values.
2. **Mean:** Calculate the weighted sum of all indices and divide by the total count.
3. **Mode:** Track the value with the highest frequency.
4. **Median:** Handle the middle elements based on the cumulative frequency.

The solution ensures that all statistics are computed in linear time with respect to the size of the `count` array.
