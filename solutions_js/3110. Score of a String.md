[Leetcode 3110. Score of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3110)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, calculate the score of the string based on the following rules:
1. Each lowercase English letter has a score corresponding to its position in the alphabet (i.e., `a` has a score of `1`, `b` has a score of `2`, ..., `z` has a score of `26`).
2. Numbers do not contribute to the score and should be ignored.
3. Other characters (punctuation, whitespace, etc.) should also be ignored.

Write a function to calculate the total score of a given string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the input always be a valid string?
2. Can the string contain uppercase letters, and if so, should they be treated the same as lowercase letters?
3. If the string is empty or contains only non-alphabet characters, what should be the output?

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a variable** to keep track of the total score.
2. **Iterate through each character** in the string.
3. **Check if the character is a lowercase English letter**:
   - If yes, calculate its score and add it to the total score.
   - Otherwise, ignore the character.
4. **Return the total score** after processing all characters.

### Code
Here's a simple and efficient solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function scoreOfString(s) {
    let totalScore = 0;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let char = s[i];
        if(char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') {
            // Calculate position in the alphabet ('a' is 1, 'z' is 26)
            let score = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
            totalScore += score;
        }
    }
    
    return totalScore;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(scoreOfString("abc"));  // Output: 6 (1 + 2 + 3)
console.log(scoreOfString("a1b2c3"));  // Output: 6 (1 + 2 + 3)
console.log(scoreOfString("hello world!"));  // Output: 52 (8 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 15)
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through each character of the string exactly once. The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are only maintaining a single integer for the total score.
