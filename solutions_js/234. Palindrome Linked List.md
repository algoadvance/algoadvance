[Leetcode 234. Palindrome Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l234)
### Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

A linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values is the same when read forwards and backwards.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the structure of the linked list node?**
   - The linked list node is defined as follows:
     ```javascript
     function ListNode(val, next) {
         this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
         this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
     }
     ```

2. **What are the constraints?**
   - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

3. **Can we modify the linked list?**
   - Yes, you can modify the linked list temporarily but the list should be restored to its original state.

4. **Will the input always be non-empty?**
   - Yes, as per the constraints, the list will always have at least one node.

### Strategy

The strategy to determine if the linked list is a palindrome involves the following steps:
1. **Find the middle of the linked list** using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. **Reverse the second half** of the linked list.
3. **Compare the two halves** of the linked list.
4. **Restore the original linked list** (optional but good for practice and interview standards).
5. **Return the result** based on the comparison.

### Code

```javascript
function isPalindrome(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return true;

    // Find the end of the first half and reverse the second half.
    let firstHalfEnd = endOfFirstHalf(head);
    let secondHalfStart = reverseList(firstHalfEnd.next);

    // Check whether or not there's a palindrome.
    let p1 = head;
    let p2 = secondHalfStart;
    let result = true;
    while (result && p2 !== null) {
        if (p1.val !== p2.val) result = false;
        p1 = p1.next;
        p2 = p2.next;
    }

    // Restore the list and return the result.
    firstHalfEnd.next = reverseList(secondHalfStart);
    return result;
}

function endOfFirstHalf(head) {
    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;
    while (fast.next !== null && fast.next.next !== null) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
    }
    return slow;
}

function reverseList(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let curr = head;
    while (curr !== null) {
        let nextTemp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = nextTemp;
    }
    return prev;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** because each step (finding the middle, reversing the list, comparing lists, and restoring the original list) involves traversing the linked list at most once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** (ignoring the space required for the input data) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.
