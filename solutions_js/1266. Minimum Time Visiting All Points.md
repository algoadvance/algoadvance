[Leetcode 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1266)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the points on a 2D plane. 

You are supposed to calculate the minimum time in seconds to visit all points in the order given by `points`.

You can move according to these rules:
- In one second, you can move diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.
- Moving diagonally from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` is considered one second if `|x2 - x1| == |y2 - y1|`.
- Otherwise, you have to take the maximum of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the points array be empty?
2. Will the points array always have at least one point?
3. Are there any constraints on the values of the coordinates?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a variable `totalTime` to keep track of the total time required.
2. **Iterate**: Loop through the list of points and calculate the time required to move from the current point to the next point.
3. **Calculate Time**: For each pair of consecutive points `(xi, yi)` and `(xi+1, yi+1)`, calculate the maximum of the absolute differences in their x-coordinates and y-coordinates. This gives the time required to move from one point to another.
4. **Sum Time**: Accumulate the total time and return it at the end.

### Code

```javascript
var minTimeToVisitAllPoints = function(points) {
    let totalTime = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
        let x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
        let x2 = points[i+1][0], y2 = points[i+1][1];

        // Calculate the time to move from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)
        let timeToNextPoint = Math.max(Math.abs(x2 - x1), Math.abs(y2 - y1));
        totalTime += timeToNextPoint;
    }
    
    return totalTime;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points. This is because we are iterating through the list of points once to compute the total time.

### Example

Let's consider an example to see how our code works:

**Example Input**:
```javascript
points = [[1,1], [3,4], [-1,0]]
```

**Example Output**:
- Move from (1,1) to (3,4):
  - Take maximum of |3-1| = 2 and |4-1| = 3, so it takes 3 seconds.
- Move from (3,4) to (-1,0):
  - Take maximum of |-1-3| = 4 and |0-4| = 4, so it takes 4 seconds.
  
Total: 3 + 4 = 7 seconds.

So the output will be `7`.
