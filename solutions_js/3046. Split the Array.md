[Leetcode 3046. Split the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3046)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of ways to split the array into `nums1` and `nums2` such that the sum of the elements in `nums1` is greater than the sum of the elements in `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values of the elements?**
   - Let's assume the constraints are typical for competitive programming: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

2. **Can either `nums1` or `nums2` be empty?**
   - Let's assume neither subarray can be empty; `nums1` and `nums2` must have at least one element each.

3. **Is the original order of the array supposed to be maintained in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Yes, the original order needs to be maintained.

### Strategy:
1. **Calculate Prefix Sum**: First, create an array to store the prefix sum of `nums` from the start up to each index `i`.
2. **Calculate Suffix Sum**: Similarly, create another array to store the suffix sum of `nums` from each index `i` to the end.
3. **Count Valid Splits**: Iterate through the array and count the number of valid splits where the sum of the elements in `nums1` (prefix sum) is greater than the sum of the elements in `nums2` (suffix sum).

### Code:
```javascript
var countWaysToSplitArray = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n < 2) return 0;

    const prefixSum = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const suffixSum = new Array(n).fill(0);

    prefixSum[0] = nums[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }

    suffixSum[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        suffixSum[i] = suffixSum[i + 1] + nums[i];
    }

    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (prefixSum[i] > suffixSum[i + 1]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [10, 4, -8, 7];
console.log(countWaysToSplitArray(nums)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the storage of prefix and suffix sums.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we are making a single pass to calculate the prefix sums, a single pass for the suffix sums, and a final pass to count the valid splits.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of valid splits by limiting the operations to linear time and space complexities.
