[Leetcode 1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1980)
### Problem Statement:
1980. Find Unique Binary String

Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings each of length `n`, return a binary string of length `n` that appears in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of `n` that we can expect?** 
   - The problem assumes that `nums` contains n unique binary strings of length n, so `n` should be positive.
   
2. **Can we assume the input is always valid? That is, the array always contains `n` unique binary strings of length `n`?**
   - Yes, we can assume the input array is always valid according to the problem statement.

3. **Is there a specific order in which the binary string should be presented?**
   - No specific order is mentioned. The problem requires a binary string that does not appear in `nums`.

### Strategy:
1. **Use Cantor's Diagonalization Argument:**
   - We can construct a binary string by flipping the i-th character of the i-th string in the given list `nums`. This guarantees that the constructed string will not be in `nums`.

### Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} nums
 * @return {string}
 */
var findDifferentBinaryString = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let res = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        res.push(nums[i][i] === '0' ? '1' : '0');
    }
    
    return res.join('');
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findDifferentBinaryString(["111","011","001"])); // Output: "100"
console.log(findDifferentBinaryString(["000","011","111"])); // Output: "101"
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the binary strings. This is because we iterate through the list once to create the result string.

By using this diagonalization approach, we ensure that the new binary string is guaranteed to be different from all strings in the input list.
