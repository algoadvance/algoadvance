[Leetcode 200. Number of Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l200)
## Problem Statement

The problem "Number of Islands" on LeetCode is as follows:

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid contain other characters or just '1' and '0'?
   - It can only contain '1' and '0'.

2. How big can the grid be?
   - The grid can be of any size up to 300x300.

3. Are diagonally adjacent '1's considered connected?
   - No, only horizontally or vertically adjacent '1's are considered connected.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var numIslands = function(grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let numberOfIslands = 0;
    
    const dfs = function(grid, r, c) {
        const nr = grid.length;
        const nc = grid[0].length;
        
        if (r < 0 || r >= nr || c < 0 || c >= nc || grid[r][c] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[r][c] = '0'; // mark as visited
        
        // Visit all the connecting lands
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
    };
    
    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
                numberOfIslands++;
                dfs(grid, i, j);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return numberOfIslands;
};

// Example usage:
const grid1 = [
    ["1","1","1","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","1","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","0","0"]
];
console.log(numIslands(grid1)); // Output: 1

const grid2 = [
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["1","1","0","0","0"],
    ["0","0","1","0","0"],
    ["0","0","0","1","1"]
];
console.log(numIslands(grid2)); // Output: 3
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with a check to see if the grid is null or empty, in which case we return 0.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Implement a helper function `dfs` that traverses and marks all parts of an island starting from a given cell. It uses recursion to visit all horizontally and vertically connected '1's.
3. **Grid Traversal:** Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a '1' is encountered, it signifies an unvisited island. Increment the island counter and use the `dfs` function to mark all parts of that island as visited.
4. **Mark as Visited:** During the DFS, change each '1' to '0' to mark it as visited, ensuring we don't count it again.

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because each cell is visited at most once.
2. **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) in the worst case to account for the recursion stack space used by DFS, especially if the grid is filled with land.

This approach ensures we accurately count the number of islands in the grid while efficiently managing the traversal and marking of visited cells.
