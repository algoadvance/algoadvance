[Leetcode 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l675)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to cut down trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an `m x n` matrix, where:
- `0` represents an obstacle.
- `1` represents an area you can walk through.
- `a` number (greater than 1) represents a tree with height `a`.

You can start at any point (r, c) where the value equals 1 or greater and you can only walk in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). Your goal is to cut down all the trees in ascending order of their heights and return the total steps you walk to do so. 

If you cannot cut off all the trees, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume all cells with values greater than 1 will be unique in terms of height?
2. Are there guaranteed to be trees in the matrix?
3. Can we start at any walkable cell or does the starting position have specific requirements?

## Strategy

1. **Sort Trees by Height**: First, collect all the tree positions along with their heights. Sort these trees by height.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to compute the shortest path from the current position to the next tree. 
3. **Walk Through Trees**: Iterate through the sorted tree list, moving from one tree to the next, summing up the steps. If any tree is unreachable, return -1.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where obstacles completely block paths.

## Time Complexity

The overall complexity involves:
1. Sorting the trees which takes \(O(k \log k)\) where \(k\) is the number of trees.
2. BFS from each tree to the next, which could take \(O(m \times n)\) in the worst case for each of \(k\) trees.
   Hence, the worst-case time complexity is \(O(k \times m \times n)\).

## Code

Here is the implementation for the problem:

```javascript
function cutOffTree(forest) {
    if (forest == null || forest.length === 0 || forest[0].length === 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    const m = forest.length;
    const n = forest[0].length;
    const trees = [];

    // Collect all the trees with height > 1
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (forest[i][j] > 1) {
                trees.push([forest[i][j], i, j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort trees by height
    trees.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    let totalSteps = 0;
    let startX = 0;
    let startY = 0;

    // Function to perform BFS
    const bfs = (startX, startY, targetX, targetY) => {
        const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
        const queue = [[startX, startY, 0]];
        const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
        visited[startX][startY] = true;

        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [x, y, steps] = queue.shift();
            if (x === targetX && y === targetY) {
                return steps;
            }
            
            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const nx = x + dx;
                const ny = y + dy;
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny] && forest[nx][ny] !== 0) {
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    queue.push([nx, ny, steps + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // cannot reach the target
    };

    // Walk through the trees in sorted order by height
    for (const [height, x, y] of trees) {
        const steps = bfs(startX, startY, x, y);
        if (steps === -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        totalSteps += steps;
        startX = x;
        startY = y;
    }

    return totalSteps;
}
```

This code handles the problem efficiently by employing BFS to determine the shortest path between successive trees and maintains the complexity through sorting and BFS traversal. If any tree is found to be unreachable, it promptly returns `-1`.
