[Leetcode 1609. Even Odd Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1609)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree that is labeled uniquely with integers starting from 1. Perform the following steps:

- The root of the tree is at level 0. The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.
- In alternating levels of the binary tree, the value at each level must meet certain criteria:
  - At even levels, all values must be strictly increasing and odd.
  - At odd levels, all values must be strictly decreasing and even.

Return `true` if the binary tree meets these conditions, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Will the tree have at least one node?
   - **A**: Yes, the tree will have at least one node.

2. **Q**: Can the given tree contain negative values or zero?
   - **A**: No, the tree is labeled with unique integers starting from 1.

3. **Q**: Are we allowed to use any specific libraries or functions?
   - **A**: You can use standard JavaScript libraries available in the running environment.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** strategy will be used to traverse the tree level by level.
2. For each level, we will maintain a list of node values.
3. Depending on the level (even or odd), we will check:
   - Even levels: Values must be odd and strictly increasing.
   - Odd levels: Values must be even and strictly decreasing.
4. If any condition is not met at any level, return `false`.
5. If all levels meet the criteria, return `true`.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

const isEvenOddTree = (root) => {
    if (!root) return true; // Empty tree case

    const queue = [{ node: root, level: 0 }];

    // BFS traversal
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        let prevVal = null;
        let level = queue[0].level;

        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            const { node, level } = queue.shift();

            // Check the value based on level rules
            if ((level % 2 === 0 && (node.val % 2 === 0 || (prevVal !== null && node.val <= prevVal))) ||
                (level % 2 !== 0 && (node.val % 2 !== 0 || (prevVal !== null && node.val >= prevVal)))) {
                return false;
            }

            prevVal = node.val;

            if (node.left) queue.push({ node: node.left, level: level + 1 });
            if (node.right) queue.push({ node: node.right, level: level + 1 });
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in the worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced (skewed), since BFS uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level. In the average case, the space complexity will be proportional to the maximum number of nodes at any level (widest level).

This solution maintains efficiency and correctness with respect to the problem constraints.
