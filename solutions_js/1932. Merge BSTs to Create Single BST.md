[Leetcode 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1932)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of `trees` where each `trees[i]` represents a Binary Search Tree (BST). Your task is to merge these BSTs into a single valid BST (if possible).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

If there are multiple ways to merge the BSTs, you can return any of them as long as the result is a valid BST. If it is not possible to merge the BSTs into a single valid BST, return `null`.

Each TreeNode in the trees has the following structure:
```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Are all BSTs non-empty?
   - Itâ€™s possible for some BSTs to be empty, but we'll assume they won't contribute to the output.

2. **Range of Values**: Do the values of the nodes in the BSTs overlap?
   - The values might overlap, which makes merging invalid if we can't ensure uniqueness.

3. **Output Criteria**: Should the merged BST maintain unique node values or handle duplicates in any specific way?
   - The merged BST should maintain unique node values.

4. **Edge Cases**: What should be the output if:
   - There are no trees? Return `null`.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start by organizing the trees into a list of root nodes.
2. **Helper Function for Insertion**: Write a function to insert a node into a BST and ensure it maintains the BST properties.
3. **Iterate Through Trees**: Try inserting each tree into a "result" BST.
   - If at any point an insertion is invalid (due to duplicate values or other reasons), return `null`.
4. **Build Result Tree**: Use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse and insert nodes.

## Code

Below is a possible implementation that follows the described strategy:

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

/**
 * Merges multiple BSTs into a single BST if possible.
 * @param {TreeNode[]} trees
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
function mergeBSTs(trees) {
    if (!trees || trees.length === 0) return null;

    const resultRoot = new TreeNode();

    const insertNode = (root, node) => {
        if (!root) return node;

        if (node.val < root.val) {
            root.left = insertNode(root.left, node);
        } else if (node.val > root.val) {
            root.right = insertNode(root.right, node);
        } else {
            // Duplicate value found, which makes a valid merge impossible.
            return false;
        }

        return root;
    };

    const dfsInsert = (root, node) => {
        if (!node) return true;
        if (!insertNode(root, new TreeNode(node.val))) return false;
        return dfsInsert(root, node.left) && dfsInsert(root, node.right);
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < trees.length; i++) {
        if (!dfsInsert(resultRoot, trees[i])) return null;
    }

    return resultRoot.left;
}

// Example use:
const bst1 = new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(1), new TreeNode(3));
const bst2 = new TreeNode(5, new TreeNode(4), new TreeNode(6));
// Should be able to merge into a valid BST.
// const mergedBST = mergeBSTs([bst1, bst2]);
// console.log(mergedBST);

```

## Time Complexity

1. **Insertion Function**: The insertion operation in a BST generally operates in O(h), where h is the height of the tree (`O(log n)` for balanced trees and `O(n)` for unbalanced trees).
2. **DFS Insertion**: For each node, insertion is called recursively, leading to `O(n)` complexities per tree if we traverse each node exactly once.
3. **Total Complexity**: If there are `k` trees with an average of `n` nodes, the complexity becomes `O(k * n * log n)` for balanced trees and `O(k * n^2)` for the worst-case skew.

Overall, the method is potentially efficient for mostly balanced trees but should be carefully handled with larger or skewed trees.
