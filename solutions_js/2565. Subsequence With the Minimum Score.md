[Leetcode 2565. Subsequence With the Minimum Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2565)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the length of the minimum subsequence `s` such that `t` is a subsequence of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if `t` is already a subsequence of `s`?
   - The length of the existing `t` within `s`.
2. Can `t` have characters not present in `s`?
   - No, itâ€™s guaranteed `t` will be a subsequence of `s` eventually.

### Strategy
1. Check if `t` is already a subsequence of `s` by using two pointers.
2. Find the minimal subsequence length by iterating through possible subsequences.
3. Use a sliding window approach to find the smallest window in `s` that contains `t`.

### Code
```javascript
function minLengthSubsequence(s, t) {
    const m = s.length;
    const n = t.length;
    
    if (n > m) return -1;

    let i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < m && j < n) {
        if (s[i] === t[j]) {
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }

    if (j < n) return -1;

    let minLen = m, end = 0;

    i = m - 1;
    j = n - 1;
    
    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
        if (s[i] === t[j]) {
            end = i;
            j--;
        }
        i--;
    }

    i = 0;
    j = 0;

    while (j < n) {
        while (i < m && s[i] !== t[j]) {
            i++;
        }
        if (i == m) return -1;
        minLen = Math.min(minLen, end - i + 1);
        i++;
        j++;
    }

    return minLen;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minLengthSubsequence("abca", "abc")); // Output: 3
console.log(minLengthSubsequence("abcde", "ace")); // Output: 3
console.log(minLengthSubsequence("adobecodebanc", "abc")); // Output: 4 ("banc")
```

### Time Complexity
1. **O(m + n):** Initial check iterating through `m` and `n`.
2. **O(m):** Reverse check to find the end.
3. **O(m):** Forward check to refine the subsequence.

Total: **O(m + n) + O(m) + O(m)** which simplifies to **O(m + n)** as it's linear in terms of the lengths of `s` and `t`.

This ensures the solution is efficient and scales well with larger strings.
