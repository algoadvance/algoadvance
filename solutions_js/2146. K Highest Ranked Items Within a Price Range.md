[Leetcode 2146. K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2146)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a 2D integer `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell presents an item in your store and the value in the `grid` represents its price. You are also given four integers `pricing`, `start`, and `k`.

- `pricing`: An array with two integers `[low, high]` which represents price range (inclusive).
- `start`: An array with two integers `[start_row, start_col]` which represents the starting point in the grid.
- `k`: The number of highest-ranked items you want to return.

The rank is determined by:
1. The shortest distance from the `start` position. This is the number of steps in four directions (left, right, up, down) needed to reach that item.
2. If two items have the same distance, then the one with the lower price is ranked higher.
3. If two items have the same distance and price, the one that appears earlier in reading order (top to bottom, left to right in the grid) is ranked higher.

Return a list of the `k` highest-ranked items within the specified price range. If there are fewer than `k` items in the range, return them all.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can I assume that the given `grid` will only contain non-negative integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of `m` and `n` for the `grid`?
3. Should the starting position always be accessible (i.e., within the bounds of the grid and not an obstacle)?
4. Are there any specific values in the grid that represent obstacles which cannot be passed through?

## Strategy:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for traversing the grid and calculating distances. This ensures the shortest path is found correctly.
2. Apply filtering to only include items whose prices fall within the range `[low, high]`.
3. Sort the resulting items first by distance, then by price, and finally by their position in the grid.
4. Return the top `k` items.

## Code:

```javascript
function highestRankedKItems(grid, pricing, start, k) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    
    const [low, high] = pricing;
    const [startRow, startCol] = start;
    
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    
    const isWithinBounds = (x, y) => x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols;
    
    // Use BFS to traverse the grid
    let queue = [[startRow, startCol, 0]];
    let visited = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(false));
    visited[startRow][startCol] = true;
    
    let items = [];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [x, y, dist] = queue.shift();
        
        // Check if the current item is within the price range
        if (grid[x][y] >= low && grid[x][y] <= high) {
            items.push([x, y, dist, grid[x][y]]);
        }
        
        // Explore the neighboring cells
        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const newX = x + dx;
            const newY = y + dy;
            
            if (isWithinBounds(newX, newY) && !visited[newX][newY] && grid[newX][newY] > 0) {
                queue.push([newX, newY, dist + 1]);
                visited[newX][newY] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Sort the items based on the criteria
    items.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[2] !== b[2]) return a[2] - b[2];
        if (a[3] !== b[3]) return a[3] - b[3];
        if (a[0] !== b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
        return a[1] - b[1];
    });
    
    return items.slice(0, k).map(item => [item[0], item[1]]);
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **BFS Traversal**: Each cell can be visited at most once, so the complexity is `O(m * n)`.
- **Sorting**: In the worst case, we may have to sort all items, which makes the complexity `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of items within the given price range.
- Combining both, the overall complexity would be `O(m * n + N log N)`.

## Space Complexity:

- **Breadth-First Search**: We use a queue which can grow up to `O(m * n)` in the worst case.
- **Visited Array**: We store an array of size `m * n` to keep track of visited cells.
- Hence, the space complexity is `O(m * n)`.
