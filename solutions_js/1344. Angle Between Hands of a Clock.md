[Leetcode 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1344)
### Problem Statement
The problem is to find the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and minute hands of a clock given the time in hours and minutes.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `hour = 12`, `minutes = 30`
- Output: `165`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `hour = 3`, `minutes = 15`
- Output: `7.5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that the inputs will be valid hours (0-12) and minutes (0-59)?**
   - Yes.
  
2. **Should we return the absolute smaller angle irrespective of direction?**
   - Yes, the output must be the smaller angle (non-negative) irrespective of the direction.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate the Position of the Hour Hand:**
   - Every hour, the hour hand moves 30 degrees (`360 degrees / 12 hours`).
   - Additionally, it moves 0.5 degrees per minute (`30 degrees / 60 minutes`).
   - Formula for hour hand position: `hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60) * 30`.

2. **Calculate the Position of the Minute Hand:**
   - The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute (`360 degrees / 60 minutes`).
   - Formula for minute hand position: `minuteAngle = minutes * 6`.

3. **Calculate the Absolute Angle Between the Two Hands:**
   - `angle = Math.abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle)`.
   - Since the clock is circular, the true smaller angle would be `min(angle, 360 - angle)`.

4. **Return the Smaller Angle.**

### Code

```javascript
function angleClock(hour, minutes) {
    // Calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands
    let hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60) * 30;
    let minuteAngle = minutes * 6;
    
    // Calculate the absolute difference between the two angles
    let angle = Math.abs(hourAngle - minuteAngle);
    
    // Return the smaller angle between the calculated angle or its complement
    return Math.min(angle, 360 - angle);
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the calculations and evaluations involve a constant number of operations regardless of the input values.

By using this strategy, we ensure that the solution is efficient and correctly computes the smaller angle between the hands of a clock.
