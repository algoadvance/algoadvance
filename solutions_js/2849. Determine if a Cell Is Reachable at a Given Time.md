[Leetcode 2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2849)
### Problem Statement
You are given a grid with cells. Each cell (i, j) can be moved to its adjacent cells (left, right, top, or bottom). You are also given a starting cell (si, sj) and a target cell (ti, tj). Given a time `t`, determine if the target cell (ti, tj) can be reached from the starting cell (si, sj) in exactly `t` moves. 

You cannot move diagonally, and the movement expects you to be in bounds of the grid.

### Clarifying Questions
Before jumping into the solution, it is essential to clarify some aspects:
1. Are there any obstacles on the grid?
2. Is the grid size known or bounded?
3. If the grid is unbounded, should we assume a large grid or that coordinates could theoretically be infinite?
4. Is time `t` always non-negative?
5. Can the starting cell be the same as the target cell?

### Strategy
To determine if the target cell is reachable from the starting cell in `t` moves using exactly the allowed up, down, left, right moves, we need to take the following steps:
1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the starting and target positions. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.
2. If the Manhattan distance is exactly `t`, then the target cell is reachable.
3. If the Manhattan distance is less than `t`, check if the difference between `t` and the Manhattan distance is an even number. This is because for each extra move, you must be able to move in a way that cancels out (e.g., moving up and then down).

### Code
Below is a JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
function isReachable(si, sj, ti, tj, t) {
    // Calculate the Manhattan distance
    const manhattanDistance = Math.abs(si - ti) + Math.abs(sj - tj);

    // Check if the target position is reachable in exactly `t` moves
    return manhattanDistance <= t && (t - manhattanDistance) % 2 === 0;
}

// Example usage:
// Starting point (si, sj) = (0, 0)
// Target point (ti, tj) = (2, 3)
// Time t = 5
console.log(isReachable(0, 0, 2, 3, 5)); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), constant time, since we are only calculating the Manhattan distance, checking the bounds, and performing a modulo operation. All these operations are performed in constant time, independent of any input size.

This solution is efficient and should cover the basic grid movement conditions as described in the problem. It assumes that there are no obstacles and the grid bounds are not an issue. If the problem includes additional constraints like obstacles or bounded grids, further checks and logic would be required.
