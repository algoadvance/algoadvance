[Leetcode 2117. Abbreviating the Product of a Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2117)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right` representing a range `[left, right]`, return a string representing the product of the range. The product should be abbreviated in the following way:

1. If the product has more than 10 digits, show the first 5 digits followed by "..." and then ending with the last 5 digits, e.g., "12345...67890".
2. If the product has 10 or fewer digits, return the full product as a string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Is `left` always less than or equal to `right`?
   - Assumption: Yes, `left` <= `right`.
   
2. **Product Size**: Should we consider cases where the product might be very large?
   - Yes, we need to handle very large products and abbreviate them if necessary.

3. **Leading Zeros**: How should we handle products with leading zeros?
   - Leading zeros should not generally be an issue as the product of a sequence of positive integers should not have leading zeros.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Product**: Directly calculate the product of all integers from `left` to `right`.
2. **Convert to String**: Convert the product to a string to determine its length.
3. **Abbreviation Check**:
   - If the length of the product string is greater than 10, create the abbreviated format.
   - Otherwise, return the full product as a string.
4. **Optimization Considerations**: For large ranges, directly multiplying numbers might lead to performance problems due to large intermediate values. However, for simplicity, we will assume direct multiplication within JavaScript's capabilities.

### Code

```javascript
function abbreviatingProduct(left, right) {
    let product = BigInt(1); // Use BigInt to handle large numbers
    for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        product *= BigInt(i);
    }
    
    let productStr = product.toString();
    let length = productStr.length;
    
    if (length > 10) {
        let first5 = productStr.slice(0, 5);
        let last5 = productStr.slice(-5);
        return `${first5}...${last5}`;
    } else {
        return productStr;
    }
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(abbreviatingProduct(1, 5));  // Should return "120"
console.log(abbreviatingProduct(2, 11)); // Should return "39916800"
console.log(abbreviatingProduct(1, 20)); // Should return abbreviated product like "..."

```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of integers between `left` and `right` inclusive. Each multiplication operation is constant in terms of loop iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` if we don't consider the storage of the large number itself since the storage used remains constant despite the size of the product.

This method should provide an efficient solution to the problem for moderate ranges. For extremely large ranges or precise performance requirements, additional optimizations and numerical methods may be needed.
