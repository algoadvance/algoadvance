[Leetcode 648. Replace Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l648)
## Problem Statement

You are given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forms present in the dictionary. If a word has multiple root forms available, replace it with the shortest root.

For example, you are given the dictionary `["cat", "bat", "rat"]` and the sentence `the cattle was rattled by the battery`. The output should be `the cat was rat by the bat`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of characters are in the sentence and dictionary?**
   Both the sentence and dictionary contain only lowercase English letters and spaces.

2. **What is the length constraint on the dictionary and sentence?**
   - Dictionary length: 1 to 1000 words
   - Each word in the dictionary: 1 to 100 characters
   - Sentence length: 1 to 1000 characters

3. **Is there a guaranteed to be a root replacement for every word in the sentence?**
   No, some words in the sentence may not have any matching root in the dictionary.

## Strategy

1. **Create a Set for Dictionary Roots**: Storing dictionary roots in a `Set` will allow for `O(1)` average-time complexity for lookups.
   
2. **Process Each Word in the Sentence**: Split the sentence into words, then for each word, attempt to find the shortest matching root present in the dictionary. If found, replace the word with that root; otherwise, leave it as is.

3. **Attempt All Possible Prefixes**: For each word, check all possible prefixes from length 1 to the word's length, and replace the word with the first (shortest) root prefix found in the dictionary.

4. **Reconstruct and Return the Sentence**: Join the processed words back into a sentence and return it.

## Code

```javascript
function replaceWords(dictionary, sentence) {
    // Step 1: Create a Set for faster lookups
    const rootSet = new Set(dictionary);
    
    // Step 2: Split the sentence into words
    const words = sentence.split(' ');
    
    // Step 3: Create a function to find the shortest root for a word
    const findRoot = (word) => {
        for (let i = 1; i <= word.length; i++) {
            let prefix = word.substring(0, i);
            if (rootSet.has(prefix)) {
                return prefix;
            }
        }
        return word;
    };
    
    // Step 4: Transform each word in the sentence
    const replacedWords = words.map(findRoot);
    
    // Step 5: Join the words back into a single sentence and return
    return replacedWords.join(' ');
}

// Example usage
const dictionary = ["cat", "bat", "rat"];
const sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery";
console.log(replaceWords(dictionary, sentence)); // Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Dictionary Set Creation**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of roots in the dictionary.
- **Sentence Processing**: For each word of length `m` in a sentence of `k` words:
  - Checking all prefixes of each word: `O(m^2)`
  - This results in a `O(k * m^2)` in the worst case.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is:
- **Total**: `O(n + k * m^2)`

This solution ensures that the words in the sentence are efficiently checked against possible roots and replaced if a shorter root is found.
