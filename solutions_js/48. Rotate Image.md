[Leetcode 48. Rotate Image](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l48)
### Problem Statement

The problem "48. Rotate Image" asks you to rotate an \( n \times n \) 2D matrix (image) by 90 degrees clockwise, in place. This means you need to change the input matrix directly without using any extra space for another matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is it guaranteed that the matrix is always \( n \times n \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \)?
    - Should we consider any special cases such as empty matrix?
    
2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the matrix be modified in place or can we return a new matrix?
  
From the problem statement, it is clear that the matrix is square, and we need to modify it in place. This means no additional memory for another matrix should be used.

### Strategy

To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise:
1. **Transpose the matrix**: Swap elements over its diagonal.
2. **Reverse each row**: Reverse the elements of each row in the transposed matrix.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Rotates the given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place.
 * @param {number[][]} matrix - The input matrix to be rotated.
 * @return {void} Modifies matrix in place.
 */
function rotate(matrix) {
    const n = matrix.length;
    
    // Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            [matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]] = [matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]];
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Reverse each row
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        matrix[i].reverse();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Transposing the matrix**:
    - We iterate over each element of the matrix and swap elements over its diagonal. That is, for every element at position \((i, j)\), we swap it with the element at position \((j, i)\).
    - `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` loop is for rows.
    - `for (let j = i; j < n; j++)` loop is for columns in the upper triangular (including the diagonal).

2. **Reversing each row**:
    - We iterate over each row and reverse its elements.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is \( O(n^2) \):
- **Transposing the matrix**: Each element is visited once resulting in \( O(n^2) \) operations.
- **Reversing each row**: Reversing each of the \( n \) rows, each containing \( n \) elements, also results in \( O(n^2) \) operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are doing the rotation in place without using extra space except for some temporary variables during the swaps.
