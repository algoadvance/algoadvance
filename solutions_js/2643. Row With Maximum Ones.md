[Leetcode 2643. Row With Maximum Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2643)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D array `mat` of size `n x m` (where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns). Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the array contains only binary values (`0` or `1`). Your task is to find the row that contains the maximum number of `1`s. If there are multiple rows with the same maximum number of `1`s, return the one with the smallest index.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the bounds on `n` and `m`?**
   - This could help in determining the feasibility of the approach based on time complexity.

2. **Does the matrix only contain `0`s and `1`s?**
   - Yes, the matrix only contains `0`s and `1`s.

3. **What should be returned in case of an empty matrix?**
   - It is assumed that the matrix won't be empty as per typical problem constraints on LeetCode.

## Strategy
1. Since each row is sorted in non-decreasing order, the `1`s (if any) will always come after the `0`s.
2. We'll iterate through each row in the matrix and count the number of `1`s. We can use binary search to improve efficiency since the rows are sorted.
3. Track the row index that has the maximum number of `1`s.
4. If no `1`s are found, the function should handle this case accordingly.

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search per row**: `O(log m)`
- **Traversing all rows**: `O(n)`
    
Combining the two, the overall time complexity will be `O(n log m)`.

## Code

```javascript
function rowWithMaxOnes(mat) {
    const n = mat.length;
    if (n === 0) return -1; // edge case, empty matrix
    
    const m = mat[0].length;
    let maxOnes = 0;
    let rowIndex = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let numOnes = countOnes(mat[i]);
        if (numOnes > maxOnes) {
            maxOnes = numOnes;
            rowIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    return rowIndex;
}

function countOnes(row) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = row.length - 1;
    
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (row[mid] === 0) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    // low is now the index of first 1 in the row or row.length if no 1 is present
    return row.length - low;
}
```

## Explanation
1. **`rowWithMaxOnes` Function**: This function iterates over each row and uses `countOnes` to determine the number of `1`s in that row, keeping track of the maximum number found and the corresponding row index.
2. **`countOnes` Function**: This function uses binary search to find the first occurrence of `1` in a row. The number of `1`s in the row is then calculated as the difference between the number of columns and the position of the first `1`.

This approach ensures an efficient search and maintenance of results.
