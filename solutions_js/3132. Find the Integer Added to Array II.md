[Leetcode 3132. Find the Integer Added to Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3132)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `n`. The value of `n` was originally added to the array but later removed (making the array one element short). Your task is to identify and return the integer `n`.

You may assume that the sum of the original array before the removal was known and provided to you as `originalSum`.

### Example:
```text
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 5], originalSum = 11
Output: 4

Explanation: The original array was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. After removing 4, the array became [1, 2, 3, 5].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of values:** What is the range of values for the elements in the array and `n`?
2. **Constraints on the size of the array:** Is there a maximum or minimum length for the array?
3. **Array characteristics:** Can the elements in the array be negative or zero?
4. **Contains duplicates:** Can the array have duplicate elements?

## Code
Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * Given an array with one element missing and the original sum, find the missing integer.
 * @param {number[]} arr - The array with the missing integer.
 * @param {number} originalSum - The sum of the original array before the integer was removed.
 * @return {number} The missing integer.
 */
function findMissingInteger(arr, originalSum) {
    // Calculate the sum of the current array
    const currentSum = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    // Calculate the missing integer
    return originalSum - currentSum;
}

// Example usage
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 5];
const originalSum = 11;
console.log(findMissingInteger(arr, originalSum));  // Output: 4
```

## Strategy
1. **Calculate the sum of the current array.** Use the `reduce` function to sum all elements in the provided array.
2. **Find the missing integer.** Subtract the sum of the current array from the `originalSum` to find the missing integer.

### Step-by-Step Example:
1. **Given:** `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]` and `originalSum = 11`
2. **Calculate current sum:**
   - Sum of `arr = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11`
3. **Find missing integer:**
   - `missingInteger = originalSum - currentSum`
   - `missingInteger = 11 - 11`
   - `missingInteger = 4`

## Time Complexity
- Calculating the sum of the array using `reduce` takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**.

This approach ensures that the missing integer is efficiently found using simple arithmetic operations.
