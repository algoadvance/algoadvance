[Leetcode 2090. K Radius Subarray Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2090)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, a `k-radius` subarray is a subarray of length `2k+1` centered at some index `i`. The `k-radius` average for a subarray is the average of all elements in that subarray. Replace each element in the original array with the corresponding `k-radius` average. If a subarray cannot be formed due to boundary conditions, replace the element with `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** Are there any constraints on the length of the array or the values within the array?
2. **Boundary Conditions:** If `k` is large enough that `2k+1` exceeds the array bounds, weâ€™ll set the affected element to `-1`, correct?
3. **Output Format:** How should the results be formatted - is it acceptable to return an array of integers with possible `-1` values for indexes where `k-radius` subarray can't be formed?

### Strategy
1. **Initial Setup:** Create a result array initialized with `-1` values. This handles the cases where a `k-radius` subarray cannot be formed.
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window approach to compute the sum of subarrays of length `2k + 1` efficiently.
3. **Window Sum Calculation:** Start by calculating the sum of the first window and then slide the window across the array, updating the sum dynamically.

By using the sliding window technique, we can ensure that each subarray sum is computed efficiently in constant time after the initial sum calculation.

### Code

```javascript
function getAverages(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length; // get the length of the array
    const res = Array(n).fill(-1); // initialize result array with -1

    // total elements in the window
    const windowSize = 2 * k + 1;

    // If the window size is larger than the array, no valid subarray can be made
    if (windowSize > n) {
        return res;
    }

    let windowSum = 0;

    // Calculate the sum of the first window
    for (let i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
        windowSum += nums[i];
    }

    // Set the average for the center of the first window
    res[k] = Math.floor(windowSum / windowSize);

    // Slide the window across the array
    for (let i = k + 1; i < n - k; i++) {
        // Update the window sum to reflect the new window position
        windowSum += nums[i + k] - nums[i - k - 1];
        res[i] = Math.floor(windowSum / windowSize);
    }

    return res;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6];
const k = 3;
console.log(getAverages(nums, k)); // Expected output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** Initializing the result array takes O(n).
- **First Window Sum:** Calculating the sum for the first window takes O(windowSize), which is `O(k)`.
- **Sliding the Window:** For each subsequent position, updating the window sum (`n - 2k` updates) takes O(1). Therefore, the total complexity for this part is `O(n - 2k)`.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by O(n), which is efficient for this problem.
