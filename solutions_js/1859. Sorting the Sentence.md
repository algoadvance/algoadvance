[Leetcode 1859. Sorting the Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1859)
### Problem Statement
Given a shuffled sentence containing words with numbers at the end, you need to reconstruct the original sentence by sorting the words based on the numbers. 

For example, the input `"is2 sentence4 This1 a3"` should output `"This is a sentence"`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Should we assume all words will have valid positions and the sentence will always be reconstructable?
   - Can there be any leading or trailing spaces in the input?
   - What should be returned if the input is an empty string?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the output be a single string composed of properly ordered words with spaces in between?

For this example, I will assume the input contains a properly shuffled sentence with valid positions.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Reconstructs a sentence according to the position numbers appended to each word.
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
function sortSentence(s) {
    // Split the input string into words
    const words = s.split(' ');

    // Create an array to store the words in their correct positions
    const sortedWords = new Array(words.length);

    // Iterate through each word and put it in its correct position
    words.forEach(word => {
        // Extract the position number and word from the word
        const position = parseInt(word[word.length - 1]) - 1;
        const actualWord = word.slice(0, -1);
        
        // Place the word in the correct position in sortedWords array
        sortedWords[position] = actualWord;
    });

    // Join the sorted words into a sentence and return
    return sortedWords.join(' ');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sortSentence("is2 sentence4 This1 a3")); // Output: "This is a sentence"
```

### Strategy
1. **Splitting the Input**: Use the `split(' ')` method to divide the shuffled sentence into an array of words.
2. **Sorting the Words**:
   - Create an array `sortedWords` to store words in their correct order.
   - Loop through the array of words, extract the numerical position by accessing the last character of each word, and subtract 1 to adjust for zero-indexing.
   - Store the word without the last character (number) in the `sortedWords` array at the correct index.
3. **Constructing the Output**: Join the sorted array into a single string using `join(' ')`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because:
- Splitting the string takes O(n).
- Iterating through the array of words and placing them into the correct position is O(n) since each operation inside the loop (extracting the number and slicing the word) is O(1).
- Joining the array back into a string takes O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
