[Leetcode 2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2310)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `num` and `k`, return the sum of all integers between `1` and `num` (inclusive) whose units digit is `k`. 

For example, if `num = 30` and `k = 7`, the sum should include numbers like 7, 17, 27.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Inclusion**: Are both `1` and `num` inclusive in the range?
   - Yes, both 1 and `num` are inclusive.
   
2. **Value of k**: Can `k` be any digit from 0 to 9?
   - Yes, `k` can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   
3. **Upper Bound Constraints**: Is there any upper bound on `num` value we should be aware of?
   - Let's assume the value of `num` is reasonably large but fits within typical problem constraints, possibly up to \(10^6\).

### Strategy

1. **Iteration**: Iterate through all numbers from `1` to `num` and check their units digit.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Accumulate the numbers whose units digit matches `k`.

### Code

```javascript
function sumWithUnitsDigitK(num, k) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        if (i % 10 === k) {
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(sumWithUnitsDigitK(30, 7)); // Output should be 7 + 17 + 27 = 51
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the value of `num`, since we are iterating through each number from `1` to `num`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the sum.

This approach efficiently iterates through the range and accumulates the sum of numbers with the specified units digit, providing the solution in linear time relative to the size of `num`.
