[Leetcode 2708. Maximum Strength of a Group](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2708)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, you are tasked to divide all the integers into `k` groups such that the sum of each group is maximized. Return the maximum strength, which is defined as the sum of the minimum element of each group.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values and the size of the array?**
   - Constraints typically provide the range of the integer values in the array and the possible values for `n` and `k`.

2. **Can `k` be greater than `n` or are we guaranteed that `k <= n`?**
   - This helps in understanding if the number of groups can be greater than the number of elements.

3. **Are there any specific restrictions on the elements' distribution within the array?**
   - Understanding this would clarify whether we can always distribute elements as we want or if there are specific requirements.

4. **How do we handle negative numbers, if they exist?**
   - This can help optimize the group distribution strategy.

### Strategy

Given the problem, you can approach it by using a greedy algorithm to maximize the sum of the minimum elements in each group.

1. **Sort the Array:** Since we want the sum of the minimum elements in the groups to be maximized, sorting the array would help in knowing which combinations yield the highest values for the minimum elements in each group.
  
2. **Group Formation:** To maximize the sum of minimum elements in each group, allocate the smallest elements to different groups after sorting, ensuring each group gets the highest possible minimum element.

3. **Iterate and Sum:** Iterate through the sorted array, and sum up these selected minimum elements for each group.

### Code

```javascript
function maxSumOfMinElements(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;
    
    // Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    let maxSum = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the first `k` elements which will maximize the min elements sum
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        maxSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k = 2;
console.log(maxSumOfMinElements(nums, k));  // Output: 9 (Groups could be [5, 4] and [3, 2, 1])
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array:** The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Summing Up the First `k` Elements:** This step takes \(O(k)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n + k)\). Given that \(k \leq n\), the dominant complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
