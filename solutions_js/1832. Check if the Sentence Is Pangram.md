[Leetcode 1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1832)
### Problem Statement

A **pangram** is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once. Given a string `sentence` containing only lowercase English letters, return `true` if `sentence` is a pangram, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - Is the input always a non-empty string?
   - Can the string contain characters other than lowercase English letters?

2. **Output type**:
   - Should the result be strictly a boolean value (`true` or `false`)?

3. **Edge cases**:
   - What if the string length is less than 26?

### Code

Here's a straightforward solution in JavaScript to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} sentence
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkIfPangram = function(sentence) {
    // Create a Set to track unique letters in the sentence
    const uniqueLetters = new Set();

    // Iterate over each character in the sentence
    for (const char of sentence) {
        uniqueLetters.add(char);
    }

    // Check if we have all 26 letters
    return uniqueLetters.size === 26;
};

// Example Usage:
console.log(checkIfPangram("thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog")); // true
console.log(checkIfPangram("leetcode")); // false
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Set**:
   - A Set is used to store unique characters from the sentence because it automatically handles duplicates.

2. **Iterate through the sentence**:
   - For each character in the string, add it to the Set. If the character is already in the Set, it won't be added again.
   
3. **Check the size of the Set**:
   - At the end of the iteration, check if the size of the Set is 26 (which means all letters of the English alphabet are present).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate over the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the Set can hold at most 26 characters which is constant space regardless of the input size.
