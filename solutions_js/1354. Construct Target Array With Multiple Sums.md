[Leetcode 1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1354)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `target` of n integers. From the array, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Choose any non-empty subarray of `target` and concatenate it in the same order to the current `target`.

Return true if it is possible to construct the array `target` by beginning with an array of `n` ones and using the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, return false.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the numbers in the `target` array be negative?**
   - No, they are all positive integers.

2. **What is the range of values for the integers in the `target` array?**
   - They are positive integers with no specified upper limit.

3. **What would be the size range of the `target` array?**
   - The `target` array can have a size of `n`, where `n` is between 1 and \(10^5\).

4. **Can the same element be part of multiple non-overlapping subarrays in an operation?**
   - Yes, as long as it is non-empty and can be concatenated back in order, it is allowed.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:** To solve this, we need to check if a target array can be made starting from an array of ones `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` using the described operations.

2. **Reverse Engineer the Steps:** For each operation, each element in the modified array is a result of summing up elements of a previous array. Thus, we can simulate the process in reverse:
   - Identify the largest element.
   - Subtract the sum of the rest elements from this largest element.
   - Repeat until the array contains only ones or it's impossible to do further.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to efficiently get the largest element.
   - The operations must terminate in a reasonable amount of time.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation of our approach:

```javascript
var isPossible = function(target) {
    if (target.length === 1) return target[0] === 1;

    const totalSum = target.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const maxHeap = new MaxHeap(target);
    
    while (true) {
        let largest = maxHeap.extractMax();
        let rest = totalSum - largest;
        
        if (largest == 1 || rest == 1) return true;
        if (largest < rest || rest == 0 || largest % rest == 0) return false;
        
        // Reduce the largest element
        largest %= rest;
        totalSum = rest + largest;
        
        maxHeap.insert(largest);
    }
};

// Helper MaxHeap class
class MaxHeap {
    constructor(array) {
        this.heap = [];
        array.forEach(num => this.insert(num));
    }
    
    insert(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this._heapifyUp();
    }
    
    extractMax() {
        if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
        const max = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this._heapifyDown();
        return max;
    }
    
    _heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[parentIndex] >= this.heap[index]) break;
            [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    _heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[0];
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;
            
            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild > element) swap = leftChildIndex;
            }
            
            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
                if ((swap === null && rightChild > element) || (swap !== null && rightChild > leftChild)) {
                    swap = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }
            
            if (swap === null) break;
            
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[swap]] = [this.heap[swap], this.heap[index]];
            index = swap;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is determined by the number of operations we perform. The main operations include:

- **Insertion into the max-heap:** \(O(\log n)\) per insertion.
- **Extraction from the max-heap:** \(O(\log n)\) per extraction.

Given that each looping operation involves a constant number of heap operations, the overall time complexity for the worst case is:

\[ O(n \log n) \]

This ensures that the constraints are met efficiently.
