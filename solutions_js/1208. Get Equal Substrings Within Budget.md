[Leetcode 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1208)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the i-th character of `s` to the i-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

You want to spend at most `maxCost` to change `s` to `t`.

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" => "bcd". The cost is 3, which equals `maxCost`.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the length range of strings `s` and `t`?**
   - Strings `s` and `t` have the same length and can contain up to 10^5 characters.
   
2. **What characters do `s` and `t` contain?**
   - Both strings only contain lowercase English letters.

3. **What is the range of `maxCost`?**
   - `maxCost` is a non-negative integer and can be up to 10^4.

### Strategy:
We will use a sliding window technique to find the maximum length substring. The idea is to extend the window by adding elements from the right until the cost constraint is satisfied. If the cost exceeds `maxCost`, we shrink the window from the left to maintain the constraint.

### Code:
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @param {number} maxCost
 * @return {number}
 */
var equalSubstring = function(s, t, maxCost) {
    let left = 0;  // Start of the sliding window
    let maxLength = 0;  // Maximum length of valid substring
    let currentCost = 0;  // Current cost of changing s to t

    for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        // Accumulate the current cost by considering the rightmost character
        currentCost += Math.abs(s.charCodeAt(right) - t.charCodeAt(right));
        
        // If cost exceeds maxCost, adjust the window by moving left
        while (currentCost > maxCost) {
            currentCost -= Math.abs(s.charCodeAt(left) - t.charCodeAt(left));
            left++;
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum length
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of strings `s` and `t`. The sliding window ensures each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use only a few extra variables and no additional data structures proportional to the input size.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum length substring by keeping track of the cost and adjusting the window as needed while maintaining the constraints provided.
