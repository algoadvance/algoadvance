[Leetcode 207. Course Schedule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l207)
### Problem Statement

You are given a number of courses `numCourses` (numbered from 0 to `numCourses-1`) and an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you must take course `b_i` before course `a_i`.

Write a function to determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites. If yes, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the number of courses (`numCourses`) be zero?**
   - Yes, it can be zero. If there are no courses, then it is trivially true that you can finish all of them.

2. **Can there be no prerequisites?**
   - Yes, in this case, it should return `true` since there are no dependencies to consider.

3. **Is there any guarantee on the range of `numCourses`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but we can assume it falls within a reasonable range for typical constraints of the problem, such as `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`.

4. **What should we assume in case of invalid prerequisites (e.g., self-dependency)?**
   - We should assume the prerequisites are valid per the problem's constraints; typically, there will be no self-dependency.

### Strategy

The problem boils down to checking for cycles in a directed graph where each node represents a course and each directed edge `[b_i, a_i]` indicates a prerequisite relationship.

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the course relationship as a graph using an adjacency list.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. We can utilize a recursion stack to keep track of nodes that are currently on the DFS path.
   - Alternatively, we could use Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting, which is more iterative in nature and can be easier to reason about for detecting cycles.

#### Depth-First Search Approach:

1. Create an adjacency list from the prerequisites.
2. Track visited nodes to avoid redundant work.
3. Use an additional set to track nodes in the current path to detect cycles.

```javascript
function canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    const adjList = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        adjList.set(i, []);
    }

    for (let [course, prereq] of prerequisites) {
        adjList.get(prereq).push(course);
    }

    const visitStatus = new Array(numCourses).fill(0); // 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited

    const hasCycle = (course) => {
        if (visitStatus[course] === 1) return true; // cycle detected
        if (visitStatus[course] === 2) return false; // already fully processed

        visitStatus[course] = 1; // mark as visiting

        for (const nextCourse of adjList.get(course)) {
            if (hasCycle(nextCourse)) return true;
        }

        visitStatus[course] = 2; // mark as fully processed
        return false;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (visitStatus[i] === 0) { // unvisited node
            if (hasCycle(i)) return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the adjacency list takes O(P) time, where P is the number of prerequisites.
- The DFS traversal of the graph takes O(N + E) time, where N is the number of nodes (courses) and E is the number of edges (prerequisites).

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(N + E)**.

### Space Complexity

- The adjacency list takes O(N + E) space.
- The visitStatus array takes O(N) space.
- The recursion stack in the worst-case scenario takes O(N) space.

Hence, the overall space complexity is **O(N + E)**.
