[Leetcode 402. Remove K Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l402)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `num` representing a non-negative integer and an integer `k`, remove `k` digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible. The result should not contain any leading zeros, and if the result is an empty string, return "0".

**Example 1:**
- Input: `num = "1432219"`, `k = 3`
- Output: `"1219"`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `num = "10200"`, `k = 1`
- Output: `"200"`

**Example 3:**
- Input: `num = "10"`, `k = 2`
- Output: `"0"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input number `num` contain any leading zeros initially?
2. What is the maximum length of the input string `num`?
3. How should ties be handled (two numbers of the same length/bordering digits of similar magnitude)?

### Strategy

1. **Stack Utilization**: 
   - Use a stack to build the smallest number possible by iterating through each digit.
   - Compare each digit with the top of the stack; if the current digit is smaller than the top of the stack and there are still removal operations left (`k > 0`), pop the stack.
   - Push the current digit onto the stack.
   - After processing all digits, if there are still operations left (`k > 0`), remove from the end of the stack.
   
2. **Leading Zeros**:
   - Handle leading zeroes appropriately when constructing the result by converting stack to a string and trimming zeros, or use a strategy to conditionally ensure leading zeros are handled during the stack operations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` equals the length of `num`, return "0".
   - After processing, if the resulting string is empty, return "0".

### Code

```javascript
function removeKdigits(num, k) {
    let stack = [];

    for (let digit of num) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && k > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > digit) {
            stack.pop();
            k--;
        }
        stack.push(digit);
    }

    // If k is still greater than 0, remove the remaining digits from the end
    while (k > 0) {
        stack.pop();
        k--;
    }

    // Join the stack to form the resulting number and remove leading zeros
    let result = stack.join('').replace(/^0+/, '');

    // If the result is empty, return "0", otherwise return the result
    return result.length === 0 ? "0" : result;
}

// Example calls
console.log(removeKdigits("1432219", 3)); // Output: "1219"
console.log(removeKdigits("10200", 1));   // Output: "200"
console.log(removeKdigits("10", 2));      // Output: "0"
```

### Time Complexity
- The solution iterates over each digit of `num` exactly once and mutates the stack where necessary. Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `num`.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the usage of the stack to store the digits.

This method ensures we always get the smallest possible number by removing `k` digits while maintaining efficiency and simplicity in the implementation.
