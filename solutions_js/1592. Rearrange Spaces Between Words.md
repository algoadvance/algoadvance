[Leetcode 1592. Rearrange Spaces Between Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1592)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `text` of words, with one or more spaces between each word. Your task is to reorder the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words, and the remaining spaces (if any) are placed at the end of the string.

**Example:**
```
Input: text = "  this   is  a sentence "
Output: "this   is   a   sentence"
Explanation: There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We distribute 9 // (4-1) = 3 spaces between words and 9 % (4-1) = 0 spaces at the end.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum length of the input text?**
   - Maximum length for the input text is constrained by typical string limits in JavaScript, but usually, such problems will have a practical upper limit mentioned in the problem statement or constraints section.
   
2. **Are the words always separated by spaces?**
   - Yes, it's guaranteed by the problem statement that words are separated by spaces.

3. **Can input text have leading or trailing spaces?**
   - Yes, as shown in the example, there can be leading or trailing spaces.

### Strategy

1. **Split the input text into words:**
   - Use the `split` method with a regular expression to handle multiple spaces.
   
2. **Count the total number of spaces:**
   - Iterate through the text and count space characters.

3. **Compute space distribution:**
   - Calculate the number of spaces to be evenly distributed between words and any remaining spaces.

4. **Reconstruct the text:**
   - Join the words with the evenly distributed spaces and append any leftover spaces at the end.

### Code

Here is a step-by-step implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function reorderSpaces(text) {
    // Split text into words ignoring empty strings resulted from multiple spaces
    let words = text.trim().split(/\s+/);
    let totalSpaces = text.split('').filter(char => char === ' ').length;
    
    let spaceBetweenWords = words.length > 1 ? Math.floor(totalSpaces / (words.length - 1)) : 0;
    let extraSpaces = words.length > 1 ? totalSpaces % (words.length - 1) : totalSpaces;

    // Join words with the evenly distributed spaces
    let result = words.join(' '.repeat(spaceBetweenWords));

    // Append the extra spaces at the end
    result += ' '.repeat(extraSpaces);

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(reorderSpaces("  this   is  a sentence ")); // Output: "this   is   a   sentence"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting and Filtering Steps:** Each `split` and `filter` operation takes O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input text.
- **Join Operation:** The `join` operation is also O(n) in the worst case since it involves concatenating strings in a loop.
- **Final String Construction:** Constructing the final result is O(n).

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is efficient for handling the problem constraints.
