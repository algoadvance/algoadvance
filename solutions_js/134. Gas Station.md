[Leetcode 134. Gas Station](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l134)
### Problem Statement

**134. Gas Station**

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i-th` station is given by an array `gas`. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i-th` station to its `(i + 1)-th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

**Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.**

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - A: The length of `gas` and `cost` will be between `1` and `10^4`.

2. **Q: Can `gas` or `cost` contain negative numbers?**
   - A: No, both `gas` and `cost` will contain non-negative integers only.

3. **Q: Is it possible that the sum of `gas` is less than the sum of `cost`?**
   - A: Yes, and in such a case, it will be impossible to complete the circuit, so we should return `-1`.

4. **Q: Do we need to return the smallest index in case there are multiple solutions?**
   - A: It is guaranteed that there will be only one unique solution if a solution exists.

### Strategy

1. **Initial feasibility check**: If the total amount of gas is less than the total cost, return `-1`.
2. **Single Pass Solution**:
   - We will use a greedy approach to determine the starting point.
   - Track the total remaining gas as we iterate through each station.
   - Keep a `current_tank` to check the gas status from the current starting point.
   - If at any point `current_tank` drops below 0, it means that starting from the last starting point can't complete the circuit, so we move the starting point to the next station and reset `current_tank`.

### Code

```javascript
function canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost) {
    const n = gas.length;
    
    let total_tank = 0;
    let current_ttank = 0;
    let starting_station = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let diff = gas[i] - cost[i];
        total_tank += diff;
        current_ttank += diff;
        
        // If car fails at the current station, reset the start station
        if (current_ttank < 0) {
            starting_station = i + 1;
            current_ttank = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return total_tank >= 0 ? starting_station : -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of gas stations. We are iterating through the list only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

This solution ensures that we efficiently determine the starting point in a single pass while keeping the space usage minimal.
