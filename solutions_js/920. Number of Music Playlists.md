[Leetcode 920. Number of Music Playlists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l920)
### Problem Statement:

You are given `N` different songs and you are tasked with creating playlists of `L` songs. Each song must appear at least `K` times before it can be played again. Your goal is to find the number of possible playlists you can create following the constraints above. Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Input:**
- `N` (number of different songs)
- `L` (length of the playlist)
- `K` (minimum repeat gap)

**Output:**
- An integer, which is the number of possible playlists modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can `N`, `L`, and `K` be zero?
   - **A:** No, according to the problem constraints, `N`, `L`, and `K` are positive integers.

2. **Q:** Is it always possible for `K` to be less than `N`?
   - **A:** Yes, if `K` is greater than or equal to `N`, it would be impossible to create a valid playlist.

### Strategy:

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll define a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to create a playlist of length `j` using exactly `i` different songs.

#### Transition Formula:
1. If we add a new song (one that hasn't been added yet), this can be done in `N - i` ways.
2. If we repeat a song already in the list, this can be done in `i - K` ways (only if `i > K`). 

The overall transition formula will be:
\[ dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] \cdot (N - i + 1) + dp[i][j-1] \cdot \max(i - K, 0) \]

#### Initialization:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` meaning there's exactly one way to create an empty playlist with zero songs.

#### Result:
We need the value `dp[N][L]`, which will give us the number of ways to create a playlist of length `L` using exactly `N` different songs.

### Code:

```javascript
var numMusicPlaylists = function(N, L, K) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

    // Initialize the DP table
    let dp = Array.from({ length: N + 1 }, () => Array(L + 1).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= L; j++) {
            // Adding a new song not used yet in the playlist
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - i + 1) % MOD;

            // Adding a song that's already in the playlist
            if (i > K) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1] * (i - K) % MOD) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[N][L];
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves filling a table of size `(N+1) x (L+1)`, hence the time complexity is \(O(N \times L)\).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also \(O(N \times L)\) due to the storage requirements of the DP table.

This solution adequately balances clarity and performance for large input values due to the \(O(N \times L)\) complexity.
