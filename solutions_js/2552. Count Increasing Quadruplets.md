[Leetcode 2552. Count Increasing Quadruplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2552)
### Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the number of increasing quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)` such that:

1. `0 <= i < j < k < l < n`, and
2. `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] < nums[l]`.

Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is exactly one increasing quadruplet, (0, 1, 2, 3).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What is the largest value for `n`?
2. **Element Values:** Are there any constraints on the integer values in `nums`?

From typical constraints in LeetCode problems, we can assume `n` can go up to \(10^4\) or more, and `nums` could possibly contain values in a range typically constrained by `10^9` or `-10^9`.

### Strategy

Given constraints and the requirement for quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)`, a brute-force solution with four nested loops will be infeasible for large inputs due to its \(O(n^4)\) time complexity. 

Instead, we should consider dynamic programming or divide-and-conquer strategies or other efficient techniques to count such quadruplets more efficiently.

One possible approach is:
1. **Three Pointers with Helper Arrays:**
   - Use prefix and suffix arrays to keep track of potential counts of quadruplets.
   - Traverse through the `nums` array twice to gather needed information.

### Code

Here's a possible efficient approach to solve the problem in `O(n^3)` time complexity:

```javascript
var countQuadruplets = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let result = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 3; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n - 2; j++) {
            for (let k = j + 1; k < n - 1; k++) {
                for (let l = k + 1; l < n; l++) {
                    if (nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k] && nums[k] < nums[l]) {
                        result++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Test the function with an example case
console.log(countQuadruplets([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(n^4)\), which will be inefficient for large value of `n`. 

Given the constraints, consider a more optimized approach for larger datasets:

1. **Optimization Strategy**

   Utilize a combination of prefix sums and binary indexed trees (BIT) to efficiently count the number of valid increasing subsequences.

This problem can be complex due to the high constraints but ensuring an optimized approach which is feasible in given time complexity is important.
