[Leetcode 3079. Find the Sum of Encrypted Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3079)
# Problem Statement
You are given several strings in a list, `ids`, where each string is an encrypted integer. Each character in the string can be decrypted to an integer following these rules:
1. The characters 'a' to 'z' represent the numbers 1 to 26 respectively.

Implement a function `sum_of_encrypted_integers(ids)` that decrypts each string in the list `ids`, converts it to an integer, and returns the sum of these integers.

Example:
- Input: `ids = ["abc", "z", "bcd"]`
- Output: `57`

Explanation:
- "abc" -> 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- "z" -> 26
- "bcd" -> 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
- Sum = 6 + 26 + 25 = 41

# Clarifying Questions
1. Are the input strings guaranteed to only contain lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'?
2. Should we consider any form of error handling for invalid inputs?

# Strategy
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum.
2. Iterate through each string in the `ids` list.
3. For each string, compute its integer value by iterating through its characters:
   - Convert each character to its corresponding integer (i.e., 'a' -> 1, 'b' -> 2, ..., 'z' -> 26).
4. Sum the calculated integer values.
5. Return the total sum.

Let's implement this in JavaScript.

# Code
```javascript
function sum_of_encrypted_integers(ids) {
    let totalSum = 0;

    // Iterate through each string in the list
    for (let str of ids) {
        let currentSum = 0;

        // Iterate through each character in the string
        for (let char of str) {
            // Convert character 'a' to 'z' to 1 to 26
            let value = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
            currentSum += value;
        }

        totalSum += currentSum;
    }

    return totalSum;
}

// Test case
let ids = ["abc", "z", "bcd"];
console.log(sum_of_encrypted_integers(ids));  // Output: 41
```

# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of strings in the `ids` list and `m` is the average length of the strings. This comes from having to iterate through each string and, for each string, iterating through its characters to compute the sum.
