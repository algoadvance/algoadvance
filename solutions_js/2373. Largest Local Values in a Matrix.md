[Leetcode 2373. Largest Local Values in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2373)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`. Generate an `n - 2 x n - 2` integer matrix `maxLocal` such that:
- `maxLocal[i][j]` is equal to the largest value of the `3 x 3` matrix in grid centered around the element `grid[i + 1][j + 1]`.

In other words, we want to calculate:

\[ \text{maxLocal}[i][j] = \max(grid[i][j], grid[i][j+1], grid[i][j+2], grid[i+1][j], grid[i+1][j+1], grid[i+1][j+2], grid[i+2][j], grid[i+2][j+1], grid[i+2][j+2]) \]

Return the generated matrix.

### Example
**Input:**
```javascript
grid = [[9,9,8,1],[5,6,2,6],[8,2,6,4],[6,2,2,2]]
```

**Output:**
```javascript
[[9, 9], [8, 6]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
- **Grid Size:** What are the constraints for the size of the grid?
  - \( 3 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- **Elements Range:** What is the range for the elements in the grid?
  - Each element in the grid will be between \( 1 \leq \text{grid[i][j]} \leq 100 \).

## Strategy
1. Create a new matrix `maxLocal` of size `(n-2) x (n-2)`.
2. Traverse through each possible top-left coordinate `(i, j)` of the `3 x 3` matrix in the grid.
3. For each such position, find the maximum value in the `3 x 3` matrix.
4. Assign this maximum value to the appropriate position in the `maxLocal` matrix.
5. Continue until all possible `3 x 3` matrices are processed.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing each `3 x 3` matrix takes \(O(1)\) time.
- There are \((n-2) \times (n-2)\) such matrices.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) since we process a constant number of elements for each of \((n-2) \times (n-2)\) positions.

## Code
```javascript
function largestLocal(grid) {
    let n = grid.length;
    let maxLocal = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
        let row = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < n - 2; j++) {
            let maxVal = -Infinity;
            for (let x = i; x < i + 3; x++) {
                for (let y = j; y < j + 3; y++) {
                    maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, grid[x][y]);
                }
            }
            row.push(maxVal);
        }
        maxLocal.push(row);
    }

    return maxLocal;
}

// Example usage:
let grid = [
    [9, 9, 8, 1],
    [5, 6, 2, 6],
    [8, 2, 6, 4],
    [6, 2, 2, 2]
];

console.log(largestLocal(grid));
// Output: [[9, 9], [8, 6]]
```

This code will generate the required matrix by iterating through each potential `3 x 3` local grid, calculating the maximum value, and storing it in the `maxLocal` matrix. This approach ensures the solution is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints.
