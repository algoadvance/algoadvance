[Leetcode 273. Integer to English Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l273)
### Problem Statement

Convert a non-negative integer num to its English words representation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**: What is the range of the integer we need to handle?
   - **Answer**: The problem specifies that the integer is non-negative. Usually, on such platforms, we can assume it will fit within the typical range of 32-bit integers, i.e., from 0 to 2,147,483,647.

2. **Output Format**: Should the words be in lowercase, uppercase, or capitalized?
   - **Answer**: The typical expectation is for the first word to be capitalized and the rest to be lowercase.
   
3. **Special Cases**: How to handle special cases like 0?
   - **Answer**: Typically, "Zero" should be the output for 0.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a JavaScript function to accomplish this:

```javascript
const belowTwenty = ["", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", "Fourteen", "Fifteen", "Sixteen", "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"];
const tens = ["", "", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"];
const thousandGroups = ["", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"];

function numberToWords(num) {
    if (num === 0) return "Zero";
    return helper(num);
}

function helper(num) {
    let result = "";
    
    if (num < 20) {
        result = belowTwenty[num];
    } else if (num < 100) {
        result = tens[Math.floor(num / 10)] + (num % 10 !== 0 ? " " + belowTwenty[num % 10] : "");
    } else if (num < 1000) {
        result = belowTwenty[Math.floor(num / 100)] + " Hundred" + (num % 100 !== 0 ? " " + helper(num % 100) : "");
    } else {
        for (let i = 0, unit = 1000; i < thousandGroups.length; i++, unit *= 1000) {
            if (num < unit * 1000) {
                result = helper(Math.floor(num / unit)) + " " + thousandGroups[i] + (num % unit !== 0 ? " " + helper(num % unit) : "");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result.trim();
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numberToWords(1234567891)); // Outputs: "One Billion Two Hundred Thirty Four Million Five Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety One"
```

### Strategy
1. **Handle Special Case**: Directly return "Zero" if the input is 0.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Utilize breaking down the integer into chunks less than 1000 using recursive function `helper`.
3. **Recursive Conversion**: Inside the helper function, convert each chunk to its English word representation:
   - Handle numbers below 20 using an array lookup.
   - Handle tens using another array lookup.
   - Handle hundreds by recursive breakdown.
4. **Higher Order Magnitudes**: Loop through the magnitude names (thousands, millions, billions) and apply recursive conversion chunk-wise.
5. **Trimming Spaces**: Ensure to trim any excess spaces resulting from recursive concatenations.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of digits in the input number. Specifically:
- Each digit is processed a limited number of times (once for ones, tens, and hundreds places).
- Recursive breakdown handles chunks in logarithmic grouping (thousands, millions), effectively working down to the constant operations for the individual chunks.

This approach ensures efficiency even for the upper limit of the input range.
