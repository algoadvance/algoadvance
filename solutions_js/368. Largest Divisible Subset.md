[Leetcode 368. Largest Divisible Subset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l368)
### Problem Statement

Given a set of distinct positive integers `nums`, find the largest subset `answer` such that every pair `(answer[i], answer[j])` of elements in this subset satisfies:

- `answer[i] % answer[j] == 0` or `answer[j] % answer[i] == 0`

If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array `nums` be empty?
   **A:** Yes, an empty array is possible. In such a case, the result should be an empty subset.

2. **Q:** How should we handle duplicate values?
   **A:** The problem states that the integers are distinct, so we don't need to handle duplicates.

3. **Q:** Is there an upper limit to the size of `nums`?
   **A:** The size constraints would depend on the typical limitations of the environment, but the solution should aim to handle reasonable input sizes efficiently.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. This helps in ensuring that for any `nums[i] % nums[j]` to hold, `nums[i]` will be larger than or equal to `nums[j]`.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.
   - Use another array `prev` to store the index of the last element in the largest divisible subset for easy reconstruction of the subset.

3. **Populate the DP Array**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` (`j < i`).
   - If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` and `dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]`, update `dp[i]` and set `prev[i]` to `j`.

4. **Construct the Subset**:
   - Find the index with the maximum value in `dp`.
   - Use the `prev` array to backtrack and create the result subset.

### Code

```javascript
function largestDivisibleSubset(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return [];
    
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const prev = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    
    let maxSize = 1;
    let maxIndex = 0;
    
    // Fill dp and prev arrays
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] % nums[j] === 0 && dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]) {
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                prev[i] = j;
            }
        }
        if (dp[i] > maxSize) {
            maxSize = dp[i];
            maxIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Reconstruct subset
    const result = [];
    let currentIndex = maxIndex;
    while (currentIndex >= 0) {
        result.unshift(nums[currentIndex]);
        currentIndex = prev[currentIndex];
        if (currentIndex === -1) {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **DP Array Calculation**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Reconstructing the Subset**: \(O(n)\)

Overall time complexity: \(O(n^2)\).

The provided strategy and solution efficiently find the largest divisible subset within a reasonable time frame even for larger input sizes.
