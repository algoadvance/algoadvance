[Leetcode 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1639)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `target`. Your task is to find the number of ways to form the string `target` by concatenating a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of characters from each string in `words`.

- Each string in `words` contains lowercase English letters.
- Each character in `words` can only be used once, and you can reuse a string in `words` as many times as needed.

Return the number of ways to form the `target` string. Since the answer could be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example:
**Input:**
```plaintext
words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"]
target = "aba"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
6
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of `words` and `target`?
   - `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
   - `1 <= words[i].length, target.length <= 1000`
  
2. Is it guaranteed that `words` and `target` only contain lowercase English letters?
   - Yes.

3. Is the character order preserved when creating the `target` string?
   - Yes, the order must be preserved.

## Strategy

1. **Character Frequency and Position**:
   - Create a 2D frequency table `count[i][char]` where `i` is the position in `words` and `char` is the frequency of characters at position `i`.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a DP array `dp[j]` where `j` represents the index in the `target` we are trying to form.
   - `dp[j]` will store the number of ways to form the first `j` characters of `target`.

3. **Transition**:
   - Transition from `dp[j-1]` to `dp[j]` by considering each position in `words` and the current character we are processing in `target`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, every addition operation should be performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```javascript
var numWays = function(words, target) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = words.length;
    const m = words[0].length;
    const targetLen = target.length;

    // Create a frequency table
    const count = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(26).fill(0));
    for (let word of words) {
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            count[i][word[i].charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
        }
    }

    // Initialize the DP array
    const dp = Array(targetLen + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    // Compute the number of ways to form the target
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = targetLen - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            const charIndex = target[j].charCodeAt(0) - 97;
            dp[j + 1] = (dp[j + 1] + dp[j] * count[i][charIndex]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return dp[targetLen];
};

// Example usage:
const words = ["acca", "bbbb", "caca"];
const target = "aba";
console.log(numWays(words, target));  // Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing (Creating the Frequency Table)**:
   - Time complexity: \(O(n \cdot m)\) where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the length of each word.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Time complexity: \(O(m \cdot \text{targetLen})\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot m + m \cdot \text{targetLen})\), which is manageable given the constraints.
