[Leetcode 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1289)
### Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts. A falling path with non-zero shifts starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column different from the previous row's column by maintaining the non-zero shift.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements of the matrix be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements of the matrix can be negative.

2. **What is the size range for the matrix?**
   - The matrix size `n x n` can have `1 <= n <= 200`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the input values?**
   - The values in the matrix will be integers within the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.
   
4. **What is meant by "non-zero shifts"?**
   - A non-zero shift means that you cannot pick the same column index in the current row as in the previous row.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** 
   - We will use a dynamic programming (DP) array to keep track of the minimum falling path sums.
   - Initialize a DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum falling path sum reaching cell `[i][j]`.
   - Iterate through each element and update the DP array based on the minimum sums of the previous row, excluding the current column index.
   
2. **Optimize the Selection:**
   - Keep track of the minimum and the second minimum values in the previous row to efficiently determine the minimum sum excluding a specific column.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var minFallingPathSum = function(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    if (n === 1) return Math.min(...grid[0]);
    
    // DP array, copying first row initially
    let dp = [...grid[0]];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Calculate minimum and second minimum of the previous row
        let min1 = Infinity, min2 = Infinity;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (dp[j] < min1) {
                min2 = min1;
                min1 = dp[j];
            } else if (dp[j] < min2) {
                min2 = dp[j];
            }
        }
        
        // Update the current row based on the minimum sums excluding the current column
        let newDP = Array(n).fill(0);
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            newDP[j] = grid[i][j] + (dp[j] !== min1 ? min1 : min2);
        }
        dp = newDP;
    }
    
    return Math.min(...dp);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
  - We iterate `n` rows and for each row, we perform operations over `n` columns.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use additional space for the DP array, which requires storing up to `n` elements at each step.
