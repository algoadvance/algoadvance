[Leetcode 1157. Online Majority Element In Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1157)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and two queries. The first query is to modify the element at index `i` to a value `val`. The second query is to find the majority element in the subarray from index `left` to `right` (0-indexed). A majority element is an element that appears more than floor((right - left + 1) / 2) times in the subarray.

You are required to implement a class `MajorityChecker` that will handle these operations efficiently:

1. `MajorityChecker(arr)` Initializes the object with the given array `arr`.
2. `modify(i, val)` Modifies the array by setting `arr[i]` to `val`.
3. `query(left, right, threshold)` Returns the majority element in the subarray `[left, right]` if it exists, otherwise returns -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of array `arr`**: What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and the values within `arr`?
2. **Number of operations**: How many modify and query operations can we expect to handle?
3. **Threshold guarantee**: Is `threshold` always guaranteed to be `<= (right - left + 1)`?

### Assumptions Based on Clarifying Questions

1. The array `arr` could be large, possibly up to \(10^5\) elements.
2. We might need to handle up to \(10^5\) operations.
3. `threshold` is always a feasible number for a majority definition.

### Strategy

For this problem, the naive approach would be either to check the majority element by counting the elements in the range or by maintaining a frequency map for every subarray query, both of which could become inefficient for larger inputs or frequent updates. 

The chosen approach involves Mo's algorithm or advanced segment tree structures, but given time constraints, a hybrid approach using direct frequency computation for the majority element will be considered:

1. **Offline processing**: We preprocess the array and queries into blocks allowing us to leverage time-efficient operations.
2. **Block-based processing**: Efficiently count elements within blocks.
3. **Efficient updates**: With modification queries, only affected blocks will need reprocessing.

### Code Implementation

Here is a basic implementation using Mo's algorithm and a frequency map within block ranges:

```javascript
class MajorityChecker {
  constructor(arr) {
    this.arr = arr;
    // Preprocess for Mo's Algorithm: let's keep block size âˆšn
    this.blockSize = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(arr.length));
    this.blocks = [];
    this.buildBlocks();
  }

  buildBlocks() {
    const len = this.arr.length;
    this.blocks = Array(Math.ceil(len / this.blockSize)).fill(null).map(() => ({}));

    // Fill blocks with frequency maps
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      let blockNumber = Math.floor(i / this.blockSize);
      if (!this.blocks[blockNumber][this.arr[i]]) {
        this.blocks[blockNumber][this.arr[i]] = 0;
      }
      this.blocks[blockNumber][this.arr[i]] += 1;
    }
  }

  modify(i, val) {
    if (this.arr[i] !== val) {
      // Update the blocks
      let oldVal = this.arr[i];
      this.arr[i] = val;
      let blockNumber = Math.floor(i / this.blockSize);
      
      this.blocks[blockNumber][oldVal] -= 1;
      if (!this.blocks[blockNumber][val]) {
        this.blocks[blockNumber][val] = 0;
      }
      this.blocks[blockNumber][val] += 1;
    }
  }

  query(left, right, threshold) {
    // Count frequencies in the range [left, right]
    const countMap = {};
    const leftBlock = Math.floor(left / this.blockSize);
    const rightBlock = Math.floor(right / this.blockSize);
    
    // If within the same block, simple count suffices
    if (leftBlock === rightBlock) {
      for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if (!countMap[this.arr[i]]) countMap[this.arr[i]] = 0;
        countMap[this.arr[i]]++;
      }
    } else {
      // Count left partial block
      for (let i = left; i < (leftBlock + 1) * this.blockSize; i++) {
        if (!countMap[this.arr[i]]) countMap[this.arr[i]] = 0;
        countMap[this.arr[i]]++;
      }
      // Count full blocks
      for (let b = leftBlock + 1; b < rightBlock; b++) {
        for (let num in this.blocks[b]) {
          if (!countMap[num]) countMap[num] = 0;
          countMap[num] += this.blocks[b][num];
        }
      }
      // Count right partial block
      for (let i = rightBlock * this.blockSize; i <= right; i++) {
        if (!countMap[this.arr[i]]) countMap[this.arr[i]] = 0;
        countMap[this.arr[i]]++;
      }
    }

    // Check if any element meets the threshold
    for (let num in countMap) {
      if (countMap[num] >= threshold) {
        return parseInt(num);
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`MajorityChecker`)**: This involves preprocessing and building frequency blocks, yielding a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Modification (`modify`)**: This updates the frequency in the block, resulting in \(O(1)\) time complexity.
- **Query (`query`)**: This depends on the distance and block count, yielding \(O(\sqrt{n})\) efficiency.

This combined approach ensures both preprocessing efficiency and responsive query performance while managing frequent updates effectively.
