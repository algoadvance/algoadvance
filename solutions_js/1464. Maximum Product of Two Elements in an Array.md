[Leetcode 1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1464)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`, where the array should have at least two elements. You need to find the maximum product of two elements in the array such that the product is calculated as `(nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1)` where `i` and `j` are any two different indices. You should return the maximum product found.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of values that the integers in the array can take?
    - Is it guaranteed that the array will always have at least two elements?

2. **Output:**
    - Should I return just the maximum product as a single integer?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What if there are negative numbers in the array? (Unlikely, as it doesn't make sense to have negative products in this context)

### Strategy

To find the maximum product of two elements in the array according to the given formula, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Sort the Array:**
    - First, sort the array in ascending order.
    - The two largest numbers will be the last two elements of the sorted array.

2. **Calculate Product:**
    - Calculate the product of the last two elements decremented by 1.

### Code

Here is one way to implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxProduct(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 2) {
        throw new Error("Array should have at least two elements.");
    }
    
    // Sort the array in ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Get the last two elements
    let n = nums.length;
    let max1 = nums[n - 1] - 1;
    let max2 = nums[n - 2] - 1;
    
    // Calculate and return the product
    return max1 * max2;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is dominated by the sorting operation:

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Accessing Elements and Multiplication:** `O(1)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider the example input array `nums = [3, 4, 5, 2]`:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
    - After sorting: `[2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. **Extract Last Two Elements:**
    - `max1 = 5 - 1 = 4`
    - `max2 = 4 - 1 = 3`
3. **Calculate Product:**
    - Result: `4 * 3 = 12`

Thus, the function `maxProduct([3, 4, 5, 2])` would return `12`.
