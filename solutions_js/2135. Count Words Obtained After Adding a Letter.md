[Leetcode 2135. Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2135)
### Problem Statement
You are given two string arrays `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string in `targetWords` can be obtained by adding exactly one letter to some string in `startWords` and rearranging the resulting string. However, you can only use each string in `startWords` at most once for matching. 

Return the number of strings in `targetWords` that can be obtained by adding a letter to some string in `startWords`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the strings in `startWords` and `targetWords` guaranteed to be non-empty and consist only of lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the length of the arrays and the strings within them?**
   - The length of `startWords` and `targetWords` can be up to 1000.
   - Each string’s length is between 1 and 100.
   
3. **Can letters be added to any position in the string from `startWords`?**
   - Yes, letters can be added at any position, and after addition, the string can be rearranged.

### Strategy
1. **Generate All Potential Candidates:**
   - For each word in `startWords`, generate all possible words that can be created by adding one additional letter.
   
2. **Sorting for Matching:**
   - To easily compare strings, sort the characters in each string. This helps in determining if one string is a permutation of another after adding a new character.
   
3. **Use a Set for Look-Up:**
   - Store all transformed and sorted start words in a set for quick look-up.

4. **Count Matches:**
   - For each word in `targetWords`, if the word exists in the set, increment the count.

### Code

```javascript
function wordCount(startWords, targetWords) {
    const transformedStartWords = new Set();

    // Helper function to sort a string
    const sortString = (str) => str.split('').sort().join('');

    // Generate all possible start words by adding one character in any position
    for (let word of startWords) {
        let sortedWord = sortString(word);
        for (let charCode = 97; charCode <= 122; charCode++) { // from 'a' to 'z'
            let char = String.fromCharCode(charCode);
            let newWord = sortedWord + char;
            transformedStartWords.add(sortString(newWord));
        }
    }

    // Counting how many target words can be formed from start words
    let count = 0;
    for (let word of targetWords) {
        if (transformedStartWords.has(sortString(word))) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let startWords = ["ant", "act", "tack"];
let targetWords = ["tack", "actt", "actke"];
console.log(wordCount(startWords, targetWords)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting a string:** Sorting each string takes \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the max length of the string.
- **Generating new words:** For each string in `startWords` (n items), we go through 26 additional characters to form new words, and each operation includes sorting—total \(O(n \cdot 26 \cdot k \log k)\) operations.
- **Checking target words:** For the m target words, checking if the sorted version exists in the set is \(O(m \cdot k \log k)\).

In summary, the solution runs in \(O(n \cdot k \log k + m \cdot k \log k + 26 \cdot n \cdot k \log k)\), simplified to \(O((m + n) \cdot k \log k)\) if we consider the constraints.
