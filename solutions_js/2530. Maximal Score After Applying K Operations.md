[Leetcode 2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2530)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers and a number \( K \). You are allowed to perform at most \( K \) operations on the list to maximize the score. In one operation, you can perform the following steps:
1. Find the maximum number in the list.
2. Remove it from the list.
3. Add back \( \lfloor \frac{\text{max}}{2} \rfloor \) to the list.

Your goal is to maximize the total score after performing at most \( K \) operations. The total score is the sum of the numbers in the list after all operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the list guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - What are the possible ranges for the numbers in the list and \( K \)?
   - Are there any constraints about integer overflow?

2. **Operations:**
   - What if \( K \) is larger than the number of elements initially in the list?
   - Should we always perform exactly \( K \) operations, even if we don't achieve a higher score?

### Strategy

To solve this problem optimally:
1. Use a max-heap (binary heap) to always access the current maximum efficiently.
2. Repeat the following until \( K \) operations have been performed:
   - Extract the maximum element from the heap.
   - Add the value of \( \lfloor \frac{\text{max}}{2} \rfloor \) back to the heap.
3. Sum the elements in the heap after performing up to \( K \) operations to get the maximal score.

This approach ensures that each extraction and insertion is logarithmic relative to the size of the heap, making the algorithm efficient.

### Code

We'll use JavaScript built-in `PriorityQueue` from libraries such as `heap` to implement the max-heap.

```javascript
class MaxPriorityQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    // Swap elements at given indices
    _swap(i, j) {
        [this.heap[i], this.heap[j]] = [this.heap[j], this.heap[i]];
    }

    // Bubble down the element at index i
    _bubbleDown(i) {
        while (true) {
            let left = 2 * i + 1, right = 2 * i + 2, largest = i;

            if (left < this.heap.length && this.heap[left] > this.heap[largest]) largest = left;
            if (right < this.heap.length && this.heap[right] > this.heap[largest]) largest = right;

            if (largest !== i) {
                this._swap(i, largest);
                i = largest;
            } else break;
        }
    }

    // Bubble up the element at index i
    _bubbleUp(i) {
        while (i > 0) {
            let parent = Math.floor((i - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[i] > this.heap[parent]) {
                this._swap(i, parent);
                i = parent;
            } else break;
        }
    }

    // Insert element into the heap
    enqueue(value) {
        this.heap.push(value);
        this._bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }

    // Extract the maximum element from the heap
    dequeue() {
        if (this.heap.length === 0) return null;
        let max = this.heap[0];
        let end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this._bubbleDown(0);
        }
        return max;
    }

    // Get the size of the heap
    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    // Get the elements of the heap (for sum calculation)
    getElements() {
        return this.heap;
    }
}

var maxScore = function(nums, k) {
    let pq = new MaxPriorityQueue();
    for (let num of nums) {
        pq.enqueue(num);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        let max = pq.dequeue();
        if (max === null) break;
        pq.enqueue(Math.floor(max / 2));
    }

    let score = pq.getElements().reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
    return score;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxScore([10, 20, 7], 4)); // Output example
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the initial heap takes \( O(n \log n) \).
- Each extraction and insertion into the heap takes \( O(\log n) \).
- For \( K \) operations, the overall complexity is \( O(K \log n) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O((n + K) \log n) \). This should be efficient for reasonable input sizes.
