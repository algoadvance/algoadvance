[Leetcode 2274. Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2274)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `bottom`, `top`, and an array `special`. The array `special` contains the floors that are marked as special. You need to return the maximum number of consecutive floors without any special floors between them.

**Example:**

- Input: `bottom = 2`, `top = 9`, `special = [4, 6]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: We have the intervals [2, 3], [5], and [7, 8, 9]. The maximum number of consecutive floors without a special floor is 3.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are special floors always within the range [bottom, top]?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Can we assume the array `special` contains unique elements and is sorted?**
   - We can assume the elements are unique, but we cannot assume they are sorted.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the `special` array**: Since the special floors might not be in order.
2. **Calculate consecutive floors between special floors**:
   - Initialize the maximum number of consecutive floors as `0`.
   - Check the floors before the first special floor (from `bottom` to `special[0] - 1`).
   - Check the floors after the last special floor (from `special[special.length - 1] + 1` to `top`).
   - For every pair of consecutive special floors, calculate the number of consecutive floors in between.
3. **Update the max consecutive floors accordingly**.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
function maxConsecutive(bottom, top, special) {
    // Step 1: Sort the special floors array
    special.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Step 2: Initialize the maximum consecutive floors
    let maxConsecutiveFloors = 0;
    
    // Step 3: Check floors before the first special floor
    maxConsecutiveFloors = Math.max(maxConsecutiveFloors, special[0] - bottom);
    
    // Step 4: Check floors after the last special floor
    maxConsecutiveFloors = Math.max(maxConsecutiveFloors, top - special[special.length - 1]);
    
    // Step 5: Check floors between consecutive special floors
    for (let i = 1; i < special.length; i++) {
        maxConsecutiveFloors = Math.max(maxConsecutiveFloors, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
    }
    
    return maxConsecutiveFloors;
}

// Example usage:
const bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4, 6];
console.log(maxConsecutive(bottom, top, special));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting** the `special` array: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `special` array.
2. **Single pass** through the array to find maximum consecutive floors: \(O(n)\).

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\)

This solution efficiently finds the maximum number of consecutive floors without any special floors by mainly leveraging sorting and a single traversal over the `special` array.
