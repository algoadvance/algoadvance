[Leetcode 112. Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l112)
### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a `root-to-leaf` path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`. A leaf is a node with no children.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `null`), the function should return `false`.

2. **Can the values in the tree be negative?**
   - Yes, node values can be negative.

3. **Is `targetSum` always an integer?**
   - Yes, `targetSum` is given as an integer.

With these clarifications, we can proceed to the solution.

### Strategy
1. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree.
2. We need to keep track of the current path sum as we traverse the tree.
3. At each node, subtract the node's value from the `currentTarget` sum.
4. If we reach a leaf node (a node with no children) and the `currentTarget` is equal to the node's value, return `true`.
5. If we reach a `null` node, return `false`.
6. Recursively apply the above steps to both left and right children of the current node.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} targetSum
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasPathSum = function(root, targetSum) {
    if (root === null) return false;
    
    // If we reach a leaf node, check if the current path sum equals targetSum
    if (root.left === null && root.right === null) {
        return root.val === targetSum;
    }
    
    // Subtract the current node's value from targetSum
    const newTargetSum = targetSum - root.val;
    
    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    return hasPathSum(root.left, newTargetSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, newTargetSum);
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the system stack during the depth-first search.

This solution works efficiently for the given problem and adheres to the constraints and requirements.
