[Leetcode 349. Intersection of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l349)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique, and you may return the result in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays sorted?**
   - No, the arrays are not necessarily sorted.
   
2. **Can the result array be in any order?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that the result can be in any order.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input arrays?**
   - No specific constraints are given, but you should assume they fit in memory.

4. **Can there be duplicate elements in the input arrays?**
   - Yes, but each element in the result must be unique.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert the first array (`nums1`) into a set to remove duplicates and allow O(1) average-time complexity for membership checks.
2. Iterate through the second array (`nums2`) and check if each element is present in the set created from `nums1`.
3. Collect the intersection elements in another set to ensure uniqueness.
4. Convert the intersection set to an array and return it.

### Code

```javascript
function intersection(nums1, nums2) {
    const set1 = new Set(nums1);
    const intersectionSet = new Set();

    for (let num of nums2) {
        if (set1.has(num)) {
            intersectionSet.add(num);
        }
    }

    return Array.from(intersectionSet);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Creating a set from `nums1` takes O(n) time, where n is the length of `nums1`.
- Iterating through `nums2` and checking membership in `set1` takes O(m) time, where m is the length of `nums2`.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

- Space complexity:
  - The space for `set1` is O(n).
  - The space for `intersectionSet` is O(min(n, m)), in the worst case.

Thus, the space complexity is O(n + min(n, m)).

This solution is efficient and meets the requirements of the problem.
