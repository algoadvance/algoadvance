[Leetcode 330. Patching Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l330)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range `[1, n]` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in array always positive?**
   - Yes, the `nums` array only contains positive numbers.

2. **Can the array have duplicates?**
   - Yes, `nums` may contain duplicates.

3. **What is the maximum possible value of `n`?**
   - There is no strict limit mentioned, but assume it can be large enough to require an efficient solution.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to ensure that we can form every number in the range `[1, n]` using the numbers from the `nums` array, possibly by adding some new numbers to the array.
   - To form every number up to a certain value `x`, we need to ensure that all the numbers less than `x` can be formed. This way, the next number to ensure can be `x`.

2. **Step-by-Step Approach:**
   - Initialize `miss` to 1, which is the smallest number we need to be able to form.
   - Initialize `added_patches` to 0 to count the number of patches added.
   - Traverse through the sorted array `nums`:
     - While `miss` is less than or equal to `n`:
       - If the current number in `nums` is less than or equal to `miss`, add it to the sum range (i.e., increment miss by this number).
       - If the current number is greater than `miss`, patch the array with `miss` itself (i.e., add `miss` and double `miss`).
     - Continue this process until `miss` exceeds `n`.

3. **Implementation:**

```javascript
function minPatches(nums, n) {
    let patches = 0;
    let miss = 1;
    let i = 0;
    
    while (miss <= n) {
        if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= miss) {
            miss += nums[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            miss += miss;
            patches++;
        }
    }
    
    return patches;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the `nums` array. In the worst case, we will iterate over each element of the `nums` array and potentially patch `log(n)` times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution ensures we keep our time complexity efficient by using a greedy algorithm to continuously patch the smallest missing number.
