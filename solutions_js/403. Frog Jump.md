[Leetcode 403. Frog Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l403)
## Problem Statement

A frog is attempting to cross a river. The river is divided into equal units and at each unit, there may or may not be a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog’s last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Return `true` if the frog can reach the last stone, otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by the following jumps: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between stone 4 and 8 is too large.
```

### Constraints:
- `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `stones[0] == 0`

## Clarifying Questions
To solve this problem accurately, some clarifications may be needed:
1. Can the frog's next jump be 0 units (effectively staying on the same stone)? 
2. Is it guaranteed that there are no duplicate positions in the stones array?
3. Should we consider the constraints like time and space complexities while formulating the solution?

## Code
Here’s a potential approach using a Dynamic Programming (DP) with memoization:

```javascript
const canCross = (stones) => {
    const stonePositions = new Set(stones);
    const memo = {};

    const dfs = (position, jump) => {
        const key = `${position},${jump}`;
        if (memo[key] !== undefined) return memo[key];
        if (position === stones[stones.length - 1]) return true;
        if (!stonePositions.has(position)) return false;

        for (let k = jump - 1; k <= jump + 1; k++) {
            if (k > 0 && dfs(position + k, k)) {
                memo[key] = true;
                return true;
            }
        }

        memo[key] = false;
        return false;
    };

    return dfs(0, 0); // Start from position 0 with initial jump of 0
};
```

## Strategy

1. **State Definition**:
   - Utilize a `dfs` (depth-first search) function, which checks if it's possible to reach the last stone starting from the `position` with a `jump` size.
   
2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a memo object `memo` to store already computed results for `position, jump` to avoid redundant calculations.
   
3. **Recursive Checks**:
   - For each jump of `k`, check the positions at `position + k - 1`, `position + k`, and `position + k + 1`. If any of these recursive calls return `true`, it means the frog can reach the end from the current position.
   
4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `position` is the last stone, return `true`.
   - If `position` is not one of the stone positions, return `false`.
   
5. **Initial Call**:
   - Start the `dfs` with the initial position `0` and initial jump `0`.

## Time Complexity
The complexity is a bit tricky to analyze due to memoization and the recursive nature of the solution. Given `N` as the length of stones:
- **Time Complexity**: In the worst-case scenario, we might need to evaluate each position with each possible jump, which leads to roughly O(N^2).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is mainly driven by memoization, which in the worst case could store O(N^2) entries.

This solution balances a manageable time complexity with efficient space usage due to memoization, making it suitable for the given problem constraints.
