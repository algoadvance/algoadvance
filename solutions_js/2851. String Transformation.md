[Leetcode 2851. String Transformation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2851)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform the following operation on `s`:

- Choose any two indices `i` and `j` (1-indexed) such that `1 <= i, j <= s.length` and `i != j`.
- Swap the characters at `s[i-1]` and `s[j-1]`.

Return `true` *if you can transform `s` into `t` using any number of operations, or `false` otherwise*.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are `s` and `t` guaranteed to be of the same length?
    - Yes, the problem states that `s` and `t` are of the same length.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the strings?
    - The problem statement does not specify exact length constraints, but typical constraints might be up to 10^5 characters.
3. Can the strings contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?
    - No, the problem states that the strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Strategy

We need to determine if we can transform string `s` into string `t` through any number of swaps. An important observation here is:

- The strings must have the same character counts for each character since we can only swap but not modify or delete characters.
- This is similar to checking if two strings are anagrams.

We can solve the problem by:
1. Counting the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. Comparing the frequency counts of both strings. If they are identical, we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

## Code

```javascript
function canTransform(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false;
    
    const charCountS = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const charCountT = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        charCountS[s.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        charCountT[t.charCodeAt(i) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (charCountS[i] !== charCountT[i]) return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Counting the frequency of characters in both strings takes O(n) time where `n` is the length of the strings.
- Comparing the frequency arrays takes O(1) time since the size of the array is constant (26 for all lowercase letters).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for the given problem.
