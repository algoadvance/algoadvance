[Leetcode 101. Symmetric Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l101)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Should we handle null input where the root is null?**
   - Yes, if the root is null, the tree is symmetric by definition.

2. **Do the tree nodes contain unique values?**
   - No, the values are not necessarily unique. The symmetry is about structure and value equivalence.

3. **Should the method be iterative or recursive?**
   - Both approaches are valid. We can choose one based on preferred style or clarity.

## Strategy

We will use a recursive approach to determine if the tree is symmetric. The idea is to create a helper function that checks if two trees are mirror images of each other.

### Steps

1. **Base Case**: If both nodes are null, they are symmetric (return `true`).
2. **Symmetry Check**: If one node is null and the other is not, they are not symmetric (return `false`).
3. **Value Check**: If values of the nodes don't match, they are not symmetric (return `false`).
4. **Recursive Comparison**: Both trees' left subtree vs. the other tree's right subtree, and vice versa must be symmetric.

### Recursive Function Signature
```javascript
function isSymmetric(root) {
  function isMirror(t1, t2) {
    if (!t1 && !t2) return true;
    if (!t1 || !t2) return false;
    return (t1.val === t2.val)
        && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)
        && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right);
  }
  
  return isMirror(root, root);
}
```

## Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var isSymmetric = function(root) {
    // Helper function to compare two subtrees
    function isMirror(t1, t2) {
        if (t1 === null && t2 === null) return true;       // Both nodes are null
        if (t1 === null || t2 === null) return false;     // One node is null
        
        return (t1.val === t2.val)                         // Values must be equal
            && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)                // Right subtree of t1 and left subtree of t2 should be mirrors
            && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right);               // Left subtree of t1 and right subtree of t2 should be mirrors
    }
    
    if (root === null) return true;                       // If the tree is empty, it's symmetric
    return isMirror(root, root);                          // Start the recursive checking from the root compared to itself
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the recursion.

The space complexity is **O(h)** where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack, which, in the worst case, will be equal to the height of the tree.

Note: For a balanced tree, the height `h` is `log(n)`, making the space complexity `O(log(n))`, but in the worst case (for a completely unbalanced tree), it can be `O(n)`.
