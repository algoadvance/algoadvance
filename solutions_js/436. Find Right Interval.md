[Leetcode 436. Find Right Interval](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l436)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is **unique**. Your task is to find the smallest interval `j` such that `startj >= endi`. If no such `j` exists, return `-1` for that interval.

Return an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i]` contains the chosen `j` for interval `i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The array's length ranges from \(1\) to \(20000\).
   - The intervals are non-overlapping and each start value is unique.
   
2. **Output:**
   - For each interval in the input array, output the index of the smallest interval that meets the condition. If there are no such intervals, return `-1`.

3. **Examples:**
   - Example 1:
     - Input: `intervals = [[1,2]]`
     - Output: `[-1]`
   - Example 2:
     - Input: `intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]`
     - Output: `[-1,0,1]`
   - Example 3:
     - Input: `intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]`
     - Output: `[-1,2,-1]`

### Strategy

1. **Sorting with Indices:**
   - First, we can sort the intervals based on their starting times, while keeping track of their original indices.
   
2. **Binary Search:**
   - For each intervalâ€™s ending time, we perform a binary search to find the smallest starting time that is greater than or equal to the ending time.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - Use the results from the binary search to construct the output array.

### Code

```javascript
function findRightInterval(intervals) {
    // Creating an array with start times and their original indices
    let starts = intervals.map((interval, index) => ({start: interval[0], index: index}));
    // Sorting this array based on the start times
    starts.sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start);

    const binarySearch = (target) => {
        let left = 0, right = starts.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (starts[mid].start >= target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return (left < starts.length) ? starts[left].index : -1;
    };

    let result = new Array(intervals.length).fill(-1);

    // For each interval, find the right interval using binary search
    for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        let end = intervals[i][1];
        result[i] = binarySearch(end);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Phase:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Binary Search for each Interval:** \(O(\log n)\)
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting + \(O(n \log n)\) for the binary search, resulting in an overall complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution ensures that we efficiently handle up to the maximum constraint of interval length \(20000\).
