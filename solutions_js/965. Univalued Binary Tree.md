[Leetcode 965. Univalued Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l965)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem #965: **Univalued Binary Tree**

A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Given the root of a binary tree, return `true` if the tree is univalued, or `false` otherwise.

### Example
```
Input: root = [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true

Input: root = [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- Each node's value is an integer in the range `[0, 99]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What data structure is being used to represent the tree?
   - Each node will be represented by a `TreeNode` object with properties `val`, `left`, and `right`.

2. Can the value of the root be `null`?
   - No, since the problem specifies that there is at least one node in the tree.

3. Is there an upper limit to how deep the tree can be?
   - Within the constraint of 100 total nodes, depth is not explicitly constrained.

Let's now move to the coding part.

## Strategy

We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and check if every node's value matches the value of the root node. We can implement this recursively:

1. Start from the root node.
2. Check the value of the current node. If any node's value does not match the root's value, return `false`.
3. Recursively check the left and right subtrees.
4. If all nodes match the root's value, return `true`.

## Code

Here's how we can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isUnivalTree = function(root) {
    const value = root.val;
    
    const dfs = (node) => {
        if (node === null) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (node.val !== value) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return dfs(node.left) && dfs(node.right);
    };
    
    return dfs(root);
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm visits each node exactly once, so the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(H) due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (a completely skewed tree), this would be O(N). For a balanced tree, the space complexity would be O(log N).

This approach effectively checks the tree for univalueness using DFS traversal.
