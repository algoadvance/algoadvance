[Leetcode 2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2150)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is defined as a lonely number if it appears exactly once in the array, and none of its adjacent numbers (x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.

Return all lonely numbers in `nums`. You can return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10,8]
Explanation:
- 10 is a lonely number because it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 do not appear in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number because it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 do not appear in nums.
- 5 and 6 are not lonely numbers because they appear more than once.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation:
- 1 is the lonely number because it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 do not appear in nums.
- 5 is the lonely number because it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 do not appear in nums.
- 3 is not a lonely number because it appears more than once.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the size range of the `nums` array?
   **A:** The `nums` array can have up to \(10^5\) elements.

2. **Q:** What is the range of values in `nums`?
   **A:** The values in `nums` can be any integer within the range \(-10^7\) to \(10^7\).

3. **Q:** Can the order of the resulting lonely numbers be arbitrary?
   **A:** Yes, the order of the lonely numbers in the output can be arbitrary.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Count Frequencies:** Use a hashmap to count the frequencies of all numbers in `nums`.
2. **Identify Lonely Numbers:** Iterate through the unique numbers and determine if each one is a lonely number by checking:
   - It appears exactly once in the frequency map.
   - Neither `x - 1` nor `x + 1` exist in the frequency map.

### Code

```javascript
var findLonely = function(nums) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    
    // Count frequencies for each number in nums
    for (const num of nums) {
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const lonelyNumbers = [];
    
    // Identify lonely numbers
    for (const [num, count] of freqMap) {
        if (count === 1 && !freqMap.has(num - 1) && !freqMap.has(num + 1)) {
            lonelyNumbers.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    return lonelyNumbers;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findLonely([10,6,5,8]));  // Output: [10, 8]
console.log(findLonely([1,3,5,3]));   // Output: [1, 5]
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- Building the frequency map: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- Iterating through the frequency map to find lonely numbers: O(n) because each key in the map is checked once.
- Total time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**
- Storing frequencies in the map: O(n) in the worst case where all elements are unique.
- Storing lonely numbers in the output list: O(k) in the worst case where no adjacent elements exist for any of the numbers in `nums`, and thus all unique elements are lonely.
- Total space complexity is O(n + k), which is effectively O(n) in the worst case.
