[Leetcode 504. Base 7](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l504)
## Problem Statement:
Given an integer `num`, return a string representing its base 7 representation.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of Input**: Can `num` be negative, and what are the bounds for `num`?
   - Yes, `num` can be negative. Typical integer bounds apply but for the purpose of conversion, we'll assume 32-bit integers.
2. **Special Cases**: Should handle zero?
   - Yes, if `num` is zero, the output should be "0".

With these clarified, let's move on to the solution.

## Strategy:
1. **Handle Zero**: Directly return "0" if the input is zero.
2. **Negative Handling**: If `num` is negative, note that and work with its absolute value. We'll prepend a minus sign to the result at the end.
3. **Conversion Process**: Use repeated division and modulo operations to convert from base 10 to base 7.
    - Repeatedly divide the number by 7 and accumulate the remainders.
    - The remainder will provide the least significant digit. Continue this process until the number is zero.
4. **Construct the Result**: Since the remainders give digits in reverse order, we should construct the result string by reversing this order.
5. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that all edge cases (like negative numbers and zero) are handled gracefully.

## Code:

```javascript
function convertToBase7(num) {
    if (num === 0) return "0";

    let negative = num < 0;
    num = Math.abs(num);

    let base7 = [];
    while (num > 0) {
        base7.push(num % 7);
        num = Math.floor(num / 7);
    }

    if (negative) base7.push('-');

    return base7.reverse().join('');
}

// Examples
console.log(convertToBase7(100)); // Output: "202"
console.log(convertToBase7(-7));  // Output: "-10"
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The number of operations required is proportional to the number of digits in the base 7 representation of the number, which is `O(log_7(num))`. This is because each division by 7 reduces the number significantly.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also `O(log_7(num))` for storing the digits of the base 7 number.

The provided solution efficiently handles the conversion of an integer to its base 7 representation, considering both positive and negative numbers.
