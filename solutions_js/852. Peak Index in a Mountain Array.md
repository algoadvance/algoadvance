[Leetcode 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l852)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` that is guaranteed to be a mountain, return any `i` such that `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`.

A mountain array is defined as an array that has the following properties:
1. `arr.length >= 3`
2. There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
    - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
    - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

You need to find and return the peak index.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the array? This will help in understanding potential performance constraints.
2. **Element Values**: Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in the array (e.g., all elements are positive)?
3. **Duplicates**: Can there be duplicate values in the array, or is each element guaranteed to be distinct?
4. **Output**: Should there be a specific format for the output, or a simple integer index is enough?

For the sake of this problem, I'll assume `arr` can be of a large size, all elements are distinct, and indices are simple integers.

### Strategy

To find the peak index in the mountain array, we can leverage the properties of the mountain array to use an efficient searching algorithm.

1. **Binary Search**:
   - Since the array is increasing and then decreasing, a binary search approach can be very efficient.
   - We can maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, and repeatedly narrow down the search range.
   - At each step, we'll check the middle element, `mid`. 
     - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, it means the peak is to the right.
     - If `arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]`, it means the peak is either at `mid` or to the left.
   
Adopting the above strategy, the implementation is as follows:

### Code

```javascript
function peakIndexInMountainArray(arr) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the length of the array.
  - This is due to the binary search approach which divides the search range by half each time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - This approach uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.

This solution is efficient and effective for finding the peak index in a mountain array.
