[Leetcode 227. Basic Calculator II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l227)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2^31, 2^31 - 1].

Note:
- You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

The expression string can contain:
- Integers (both positive and negative)
- The four operators `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`
- Empty spaces

Example 1:
```
Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```

Example 2:
```
Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```

Example 3:
```
Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. How should we handle spaces in the expression?
    - Spaces should be ignored.
2. Are there any parentheses in the expression?
    - No, the expression doesn't contain any parentheses.
3. Do we need to handle negative numbers in the input string?
    - No, negative numbers are not stated as part of the input, but subtraction is allowed.

### Strategy:
1. **Preprocessing**: Remove any spaces from the input string.
2. **Initialization**:
    - Use a stack to handle the numbers and intermediate results.
    - Use a variable to store the current number being formed.
    - Use a variable to store the last operator seen.
3. **Iteration**:
    - Traverse the string character by character.
    - When encountering a digit, continue forming the current number.
    - When encountering an operator or reaching the end of the string:
        - Push the current number onto the stack based on the last operator.
        - Update the last operator.
        - Reset the current number.
4. **Final Calculation**:
    - Sum up all values in the stack to get the final result.

### Code:

```javascript
function calculate(s) {
    const stack = [];
    let currentNumber = 0;
    let operator = '+';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];

        if (char === ' ') {
            continue;
        }
        
        if (!isNaN(char)) {
            currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + parseInt(char, 10);
        }

        if (isNaN(char) || i === s.length - 1) {
            if (operator === '+') {
                stack.push(currentNumber);
            } else if (operator === '-') {
                stack.push(-currentNumber);
            } else if (operator === '*') {
                stack.push(stack.pop() * currentNumber);
            } else if (operator === '/') {
                stack.push(Math.trunc(stack.pop() / currentNumber));
            }
            operator = char;
            currentNumber = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We make a single pass over the string and perform constant time operations on the stack.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, we might store all numbers in the stack if there are no * or / operations.
