[Leetcode 2541. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2541)
### Problem Statement:

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and an integer `k`, you can perform the following operation on `nums1`:

- Choose an index `i` and increment `nums1[i]` by `k` (i.e., `nums1[i] = nums1[i] + k`).
- Choose an index `i` and decrement `nums1[i]` by `k` (i.e., `nums1[i] = nums1[i] - k`).

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make `nums1` equal to `nums2`. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can `nums1` and `nums2` contain negative numbers?
2. What is the range of values for `nums1`, `nums2`, and `k`?
3. Can `k` be zero?

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Check**: If `k` is zero, then check whether `nums1` is already equal to `nums2`. If not, immediately return `-1`.
2. **Calculate Differences**: Compute the differences for each corresponding pair in `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. **Check Divisibility**: For each difference, check if it is divisible by `k`. If not, it is impossible to equalize the arrays.
4. **Sum of Operations**: Sum positive and negative operations separately and return the higher absolute value (as the number of operations).

### Code:

```javascript
var minOperations = function(nums1, nums2, k) {
    if (k === 0) return nums1.every((num, index) => num === nums2[index]) ? 0 : -1;
    
    let operations = 0;
    let incrementNeeded = 0;
    let decrementNeeded = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
        let diff = nums2[i] - nums1[i];
        if (diff % k !== 0) return -1;

        if (diff > 0) incrementNeeded += diff / k;
        else decrementNeeded += -diff / k;
    }

    return (incrementNeeded === decrementNeeded) ? incrementNeeded : -1;
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check for `k` Zero**: If `k` is zero and `nums1` is not equal to `nums2`, return `-1` because no changes can be made.
2. **Calculate Differences**: For each element in `nums1` and `nums2`, calculate `diff = nums2[i] - nums1[i]`.
3. **Check Divisibility**: If `diff % k !== 0`, it means we can't perform the operations required, so return `-1`.
4. **Count Operations**:
    - If `diff > 0`, then increment operations are needed (`incrementNeeded`).
    - If `diff < 0`, then decrement operations are needed (`decrementNeeded`).
5. **Condition Check**: Finally, check if the sum of increment operations equals decrement operations, as both are needed to balance out and make the arrays equal.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: We iterate through each element of the arrays once and perform constant time operations.

This solution is efficient and ensures that all edge cases (like non-divisible differences and `k` being zero) are handled properly.
