[Leetcode 1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1309)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` formed by digits and `'#'`. We want to decrypt the string to reveal the original alphabet that was used to form it. The mapping for the string is as follows:
- Characters ('a' to 'i'): represented by ('1' to '9').
- Characters ('j' to 'z'): represented by ('10#' to '26#').

Given a string `s`, return the decrypted string according to the mappings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Can the input string `s` be empty?
    - What will be the maximum length of the input string `s`?

2. **Output Specifications:**
    - Should the output string be in lowercase?
    - Will there always be a valid conversion for the given input string?

### Code

Let's write the code to solve this problem.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var freqAlphabets = function(s) {
    let result = '';
    let i = 0;

    while (i < s.length) {
        if (i + 2 < s.length && s[i + 2] === '#') {
            // The substring in the form "10#", "11#", ..., "26#"
            let num = s.substring(i, i + 2);
            result += String.fromCharCode(96 + parseInt(num));
            i += 3; // move past the "##"
        } else {
            // Single digit (1-9) corresponding to 'a'-'i'
            result += String.fromCharCode(96 + parseInt(s[i]));
            i += 1; // move past the single digit
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the string**: Use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string `s`.

2. **Check for Map**:
    - If the current character is part of a "number + #” combination (i.e., the current position+2 character is '#'), then convert the two-digit number and append the corresponding character to the result string.
    - If the current character is a single digit, convert it directly and append the corresponding character to the result string.

3. **Conversion Details**:
    - Use `String.fromCharCode(96 + parseInt(num))` to convert numerical values to their corresponding alphabetical characters based on their ASCII values (where 'a' starts from 97).

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we are processing each character of the string exactly once in a single pass through the string.
