[Leetcode 1331. Rank Transform of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1331)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank. The rank represents how large the element is. The rank of an element is defined as follows:
- The rank is an integer starting from 1.
- The smallest element should be assigned rank 1.
- The second smallest element should be assigned rank 2, and so on.
- If two elements are equal, they should have the same rank.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]
Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]

Input: arr = [100, 100, 100]
Output: [1, 1, 1]

Input: arr = [37, 12, 28, 9, 100, 56, 80, 5, 12]
Output: [5, 3, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 1, 3]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Duplicates:** How should ranks be assigned when elements are duplicated?
   - Ranks should be consistent; equal elements should share the same rank.
   
2. **Negative Values:** Can the array include negative numbers?
   - Yes, the array can include negative numbers.

3. **Empty Array:** What is the expected output for an empty array?
   - The output should be an empty array.

4. **Size of Array:** Is there any constraint on the size of the array?
   - Typically, problems would work within standard constraints provided by JavaScript's number and memory limitations unless stated otherwise.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Sort the Unique Elements:** Create a sorted list of unique elements from the array.
2. **Create a Rank Mapping:** Utilize a map to assign ranks to each unique element.
3. **Transform the Array:** Replace each element in the original array with its corresponding rank from the map.

### Code:

Here's the JavaScript code to achieve the above strategy:

```javascript
function arrayRankTransform(arr) {
    if (arr.length === 0) return [];

    // Step 1: Sort the unique values in the array
    let sortedUnique = Array.from(new Set(arr)).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Step 2: Create a rank map
    let rankMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedUnique.length; i++) {
        rankMap.set(sortedUnique[i], i + 1);
    }

    // Step 3: Transform the original array to ranks
    return arr.map(num => rankMap.get(num));
}

// Example usage:
console.log(arrayRankTransform([40, 10, 20, 30]));  // Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]
console.log(arrayRankTransform([100, 100, 100]));   // Output: [1, 1, 1]
console.log(arrayRankTransform([37, 12, 28, 9, 100, 56, 80, 5, 12]));  // Output: [5, 3, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 1, 3]
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Sorting:** The complexity of sorting the unique elements is \(O(U \log U)\) where \(U\) is the number of unique elements.
2. **Rank Mapping:** Creating the rank map (with unique elements) is \(O(U)\).
3. **Transformation:** Mapping the ranks to the original array is \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the length of the input array.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N + N)\) which simplifies to \(O(N \log N)\) since sorting is the most computationally expensive operation.
