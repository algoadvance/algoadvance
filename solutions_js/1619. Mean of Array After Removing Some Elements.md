[Leetcode 1619. Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1619)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return the mean of the remaining integers after removing the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the behavior if the array length is less than 20?**
   - The assumption can be made that the array will contain sufficient elements such that removing 5% of the smallest and largest elements will be possible.

2. **What if the percentage of elements to remove doesnâ€™t lead to an integer?**
   - The problem implies we should round down since we talk about "removing the smallest 5%."

3. **How should ties be handled when removing top/bottom elements?**
   - If there are repeated values at the boundary, only the exact number derived from the 5% calculation should be removed.

4. **What is the expected return value?**
   - The mean should be a floating-point number.

### Strategy

1. Calculate the number of elements to remove from both ends. This can be computed as `Math.floor(arr.length * 0.05)`.
2. Sort the array to identify the smallest and largest elements easily.
3. Remove the smallest 5% and the largest 5% elements.
4. Calculate the mean of the remaining elements.
5. Return the calculated mean.

### Code

```javascript
const trimMean = (arr) => {
    // Sort the array
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const n = arr.length;
    const removeCount = Math.floor(n * 0.05);
    
    // Slice off the smallest and largest 5% of elements
    const trimmedArray = arr.slice(removeCount, n - removeCount);
    
    // Calculate the sum of the remaining elements
    const sum = trimmedArray.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    
    // Calculate and return the mean
    const mean = sum / trimmedArray.length;
    return mean;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(trimMean([1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8,8,9,9,10])); // The expected output
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Slicing the array and reducing it to find the sum:** \(O(n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

Thus, the code should perform efficiently even for moderately large input sizes.
