[Leetcode 423. Reconstruct Original Digits from English](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l423)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains an out-of-order English representation of digits, ranging from 0 to 9. The task is to reconstruct the digits in ascending order.

Given an input string `s`, which contains lowercase English letters, reconstruct the original digits from the string. Return the digits in ascending order as a string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - Does the input string always guarantee to be a valid jumbled representation of some digits?
   
2. **Output constraints**:
   - Should the output be a single string of digits without any separators?
   
3. **Edge cases**:
   - How should we handle an empty string as input?

### Code

To solve this problem, we can use a frequency map or hash map to count the occurrence of each character in the given string. Then, we can use specific unique characters that are unique to certain digits to determine the order and frequency of the digits.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var originalDigits = function(s) {
    // Frequency map to count occurrences of each character
    const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let char of s) {
        count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    // Array to store the count of each digit, initialized to zero
    const digitCount = new Array(10).fill(0);

    // Identifying digit counts using unique characters
    // 'z' is only in "zero"
    digitCount[0] = count['z'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
    // 'w' is only in "two"
    digitCount[2] = count['w'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
    // 'u' is only in "four"
    digitCount[4] = count['u'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
    // 'x' is only in "six"
    digitCount[6] = count['x'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
    // 'g' is only in "eight"
    digitCount[8] = count['g'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)];
    // 'h' is in "three" and "eight"
    digitCount[3] = count['h'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] - digitCount[8];
    // 'f' is in "five" and "four"
    digitCount[5] = count['f'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] - digitCount[4];
    // 's' is in "seven" and "six"
    digitCount[7] = count['s'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] - digitCount[6];
    // 'i' is in "nine", "five", "six", and "eight"
    digitCount[9] = count['i'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] - digitCount[5] - digitCount[6] - digitCount[8];
    // 'o' is in "one", "zero", "two", and "four"
    digitCount[1] = count['o'.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] - digitCount[0] - digitCount[2] - digitCount[4];
    
    // Constructing the output string
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        result += i.toString().repeat(digitCount[i]);
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each character in the input string.
  
2. **Unique Character Identification**: Use characters that are unique to certain digits to identify the amount of each digit:
   - 'z' for "zero" (0)
   - 'w' for "two" (2)
   - 'u' for "four" (4)
   - 'x' for "six" (6)
   - 'g' for "eight" (8)
  
3. **Character Deduction**: Deduce the count of other digits by subtracting known counts from overlapping characters:
   - 'h' for "three" (3) after accounting for "eight"
   - 'f' for "five" (5) after accounting for "four"
   - 's' for "seven" (7) after accounting for "six"
   - 'i' for "nine" (9) after accounting for "five", "six", and "eight"
   - 'o' for "one" (1) after accounting for "zero", "two", and "four"
  
4. **Construct Result**: Build and return the result string by repeating the digit characters according to their counts.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The solution involves iterating through the string to build the frequency map and then processing fixed-length operations to calculate the digit counts and create the final string.
