[Leetcode 1765. Map of Highest Peak](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1765)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D integer array `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of land (0) and water (1), you need to create a 2D integer array `heights` of the same size where:

- `heights[i][j]` represents the height of cell (i, j).
- The height of any water cell is 0.
- The heights of adjacent land cells are at most 1 unit different.
- The height of any land cell is the smallest non-negative number fulfilling the above conditions.

Return the 2D array `heights`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the possible dimensions for the map? (e.g., `1 <= m, n <= 1000`).
   - Are there any cases where the map contains only water or only land?
   - Are there multiple water cells connected together?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - Should the result be returned as a new 2D array, keeping the input array unchanged?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Heights:**
   - Create a 2D array `heights` of the same size as `isWater`, filled initially with a special value (e.g., -1) to indicate unprocessed cells.

2. **Use BFS to Propagate Heights:**
   - Initialize all water cells (`isWater[i][j] == 1`) in the queue with height 0.
   - Perform a multi-source breadth-first search (BFS) to propagate the heights to the land cells.
   - In each BFS step, update the neighboring cells' heights by incrementing from the current cell.

3. **Consider Directions:**
   - Use directions for moving top, bottom, left, right from the current cell.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Check for edge cases such as the input map being entirely water or entirely land.

### Code

```javascript
function highestPeak(isWater) {
  const m = isWater.length;
  const n = isWater[0].length;
  const heights = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(-1));
  const queue = [];

  // Initialize the queue with all water cells.
  for (let i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      if (isWater[i][j] === 1) {
        heights[i][j] = 0;
        queue.push([i, j]);
      }
    }
  }

  const directions = [
    [-1, 0], // up
    [1, 0],  // down
    [0, -1], // left
    [0, 1]   // right
  ];

  // Perform BFS to calculate heights.
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [x, y] = queue.shift();
    for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
      const nx = x + dx;
      const ny = y + dy;
      if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && heights[nx][ny] === -1) {
        heights[nx][ny] = heights[x][y] + 1;
        queue.push([nx, ny]);
      }
    }
  }

  return heights;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization Phase: O(m * n)**
  - We traverse the entire matrix to initialize water cells in the queue.
  
- **BFS Phase: O(m * n)**
  - Each cell is processed once, and each edge is considered once, leading to an overall complexity of O(m * n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**.

### Space Complexity

- **Queue: O(m * n)**
  - In the worst case, all cells could be added to the queue.
  
- **Heights Array: O(m * n)**
  - We store an additional array of the same size as the input.

Thus, the overall space complexity is **O(m * n)**.
