[Leetcode 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1000)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the `i-th` stone and an integer `K`.

We need to merge the stones until only one pile is left. In each step, exactly `K` consecutive piles are merged into one, and the cost of this merge is the sum of the weights of these `K` piles. The goal is to minimize the total cost of merging all the stones into one pile. If it is impossible to merge the stones into one pile, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Inputs**: 
    - `stones`: An array of integers representing the weight of the stones.
    - `K`: An integer representing the number of consecutive piles to be merged at each step.

2. **Outputs**:
    - An integer representing the minimum cost to merge the stones into one pile, or -1 if it is impossible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use dynamic programming (DP). Here's a brief strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to merge stones from index `i` to index `j`.

2. **Base Cases**:
    - `dp[i][i] = 0` because no cost is needed to merge a single stone.

3. **Prefix Sums**:
    - Use a prefix sum array to easily compute the sum of any subarray, which will help in calculating merge costs efficiently.

4. **Transition**:
    - To fill `dp[i][j]`, consider different possible positions to split the subarray `stones[i...j]` into smaller parts according to the value of `K`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
    - Merge the parts iteratively and add the sum of weights as additional cost until only one pile remains.

6. **Check Feasibility**:
    - If `(j-i) % (K-1) != 0`, it's impossible to merge stones[i...j] into one pile because they can't be divided into exactly `K` piles repeatedly.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
var mergeStones = function(stones, K) {
    const n = stones.length;
    if ((n - 1) % (K - 1) !== 0) return -1;
  
    const prefixSum = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stones[i];
    }

    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    for (let length = K; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i + length <= n; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            dp[i][j] = Infinity;
            for (let mid = i; mid < j; mid += (K - 1)) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][mid] + dp[mid + 1][j]);
            }
            if ((j - i) % (K - 1) == 0) {
                dp[i][j] += prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of `dp` array**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Prefix sum calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **DP transitions**: The nested loops and updates have a complexity of \(O(n^3 / k)\) due to the optimization by merging every \(K-1\) elements.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n^3 / K)\).

This solution leverages dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum cost to merge all stones into one pile while ensuring it handles the feasibility and merges efficiently using prefix sums and DP state transitions.
