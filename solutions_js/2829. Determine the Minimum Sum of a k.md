[Leetcode 2829. Determine the Minimum Sum of a k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2829)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers, `n` and `k`. Your task is to construct an array of length `n` such that the sum of its elements is minimized and no element in the array is equal to `k`. Provide a function `minimumSum(n, k)` to return this minimum sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n` and `k`**: Can `n` and `k` be any positive integers?
2. **Array Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values in the array (e.g., should they be positive integers)?
3. **Output**: Is the output supposed to be the sum of the array or the array itself?
4. **Uniqueness**: Should all elements in the array be unique, or can we have duplicate elements as long as no element equals `k`?

### Strategy

1. **Avoid `k`**: Ensure that no element in the array is equal to `k`.
2. **Minimize Sum**: To minimize the sum, select the smallest possible integers. Avoid `k` by skipping it while forming the array.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty array and a variable to accumulate the sum.
2. Iterate through the integers starting from 1, adding each integer to the array unless it equals `k`.
3. Stop once the array has `n` elements.
4. Return the sum of the array.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumSum(n, k) {
    let result = [];
    let sum = 0;
    let num = 1; // start with the smallest positive integer
    
    while (result.length < n) {
        if (num !== k) {
            result.push(num);
            sum += num;
        }
        num++;
    }
    
    return sum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), since we iterate and add values until we reach `n` elements in the array.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty array `result` and a `sum` variable to keep track of the total sum.
2. **Iterate and Populate**: We use a `while` loop to keep adding numbers to the array until its length equals `n`. During each iteration, we check if the current number is not equal to `k` before adding it to the array and updating the sum.
3. **Result**: Once we have `n` elements, we return the total sum of the array.

By following this method, we ensure that the array has the required length with the minimum sum possible while avoiding the number `k`.
