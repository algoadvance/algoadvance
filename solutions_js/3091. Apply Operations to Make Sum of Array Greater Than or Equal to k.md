[Leetcode 3091. Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3091)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers and a target integer `k`. Our goal is to make the sum of the array greater than or equal to `k` using the minimum number of operations. In each operation, we can increment any element of the array by 1. We need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

## Example
If the input array is `[1, 2, 3]` and `k` is `10`, the sum of the array is currently `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. We need to add a total of `10 - 6 = 4` to any of the elements (or combination of elements) to make the sum 10 or greater. This would take a minimum of 4 operations.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on array size and element values**: What is the range of values for the array length and the array elements?
2. **Negative numbers**: Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
3. **Multiple valid outputs**: Is there always only one solution, or can there be multiple valid ways to achieve the goal?

Assuming the following based on typical constraints:
- The number of elements in the array `n` is between 1 and 10^4.
- The values of the elements `a[i]` and target `k` are between -10^4 and 10^4.
- We should handle both positive and negative values.

## Strategy
1. **Compute the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the array elements.
2. **Calculate the Difference**: Calculate the difference required to reach `k` from the current sum.
3. **Return the Difference**: Since each operation is incrementing by 1, the number of operations required is equal to the difference.

### Steps
1. Calculate the sum of the current array.
2. Calculate the difference between `k` and the current sum.
3. If the difference is greater than zero, that is the number of operations required. If the current sum is already greater than or equal to `k`, then zero operations are needed.

## Code

```javascript
function minOperationsToReachK(arr, k) {
    // Step 1: Calculate the current sum of the array
    let currentSum = arr.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

    // Step 2: Calculate the difference needed to reach k
    let difference = k - currentSum;
    
    // Step 3: If difference is positive, return it as the number of operations needed
    // If the current sum is already >= k, return 0
    return Math.max(difference, 0);
}
```

## Example Usage
```javascript
console.log(minOperationsToReachK([1, 2, 3], 10)); // Output: 4
console.log(minOperationsToReachK([-1, -2, -3], 0)); // Output: 6
console.log(minOperationsToReachK([10, 5, 2], 16)); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is due to the single pass required to sum the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

With these steps, we can efficiently find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of an array greater than or equal to `k`.
