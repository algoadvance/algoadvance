[Leetcode 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l857)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

There are `N` workers, the `i-th` worker has a `quality[i]` and a minimum wage expectation `wage[i]`.

Now we want to hire exactly `K` workers to minimize the total cost. The cost to hire one worker is their actual wage.

To satisfy the conditions set by the K workers, we must pay them at least their expected wage, and for every worker among the K workers, we must compute a "wage to quality ratio". This ratio is consistent, i.e., for any two workers i and j among K workers, it must be `wage[i] / quality[i] = wage[j] / quality[j]`.

We are to determine the minimum cost required to hire `K` workers under the constraints described above.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Do the workers need to be hired in the order they appear in the `quality` and `wage` lists?
   - No, we can choose any K workers.

2. Are the quality and wage arrays guaranteed to have the same length?
   - Yes, `quality.length == wage.length == N`.

3. Is there a possibility of encountering very large numbers for quality or wage?
   - You should assume reasonable constraints for competitive programming ranges (typically up to 10^4 or similar).

### Strategy

To approach this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. Compute the "wage to quality" ratio for each worker.
2. Consider each worker as the highest ratio in a potential group of K workers. Workers are sorted by their `wage/quality` ratio.
3. Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest quality sum for a group of K workers at each step.
4. Iterate over the sorted list, maintain a heap of the K smallest qualities, and compute the possible minimum cost based on the current worker's ratio and the sum of the K smallest qualities.

### Code

```javascript
function mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage, K) {
    let workers = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < quality.length; i++) {
        workers.push([wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]]);
    }
    
    // Sort workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio
    workers.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    const maxHeap = new MaxHeap();
    let sumQuality = 0;
    let minCost = Infinity;
    
    for (let [ratio, quality] of workers) {
        sumQuality += quality;
        maxHeap.add(quality);
        
        if (maxHeap.size() > K) {
            sumQuality -= maxHeap.poll();
        }
        
        if (maxHeap.size() === K) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, sumQuality * ratio);
        }
    }
    
    return minCost;
}

class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    add(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this._bubbleUp();
    }
    
    poll() {
        const max = this.heap[0];
        const end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this._sinkDown(0);
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }
    
    _bubbleUp() {
        let idx = this.heap.length - 1;
        const element = this.heap[idx];
        while (idx > 0) {
            let parentIdx = Math.floor((idx - 1) / 2);
            let parent = this.heap[parentIdx];
            if (element <= parent) break;
            this.heap[idx] = parent;
            this.heap[parentIdx] = element;
            idx = parentIdx;
        }
    }
    
    _sinkDown(idx) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[idx];
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIdx = 2 * idx + 1;
            let rightChildIdx = 2 * idx + 2;
            let swap = null;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIdx];
                if (leftChild > element) swap = leftChildIdx;
            }
            if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIdx];
                if (
                    (swap === null && rightChild > element) ||
                    (swap !== null && rightChild > leftChild)
                ) swap = rightChildIdx;
            }
            if (swap === null) break;
            this.heap[idx] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            idx = swap;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the workers based on the `wage/quality` ratio takes O(N log N).
- Utilizing the max-heap operations (add and poll) takes O(log K), which is done N times, making it O(N log K).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N log N + N log K), which is efficient, especially for constraints typically up to 10^4.
