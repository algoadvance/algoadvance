[Leetcode 1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1359)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` orders, each order consists of a pickup and a delivery service. 

Compute the number of valid sequences such that delivery(i) is always after pickup(i). 

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a valid sequence?**
   - A valid sequence ensures that for any order `i`, the delivery `Di` happens after the pickup `Pi`.

2. **What's the constraint on `n`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 500`.

3. **Should the result be modulo `10^9 + 7`?**
   - Yes, the final result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences with `i` pairs of pickups and deliveries.
   - We define `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to arrange zero pairs (the empty sequence).

2. **Formulation**:
   - For `i` pairs, consider the valid sequences that can be formed by adding the i-th pickup and its corresponding delivery.
   - There are `(2*i-1)` gaps where `Pi` can be placed in the sequence. After placing `Pi`, there are `(2*i)` positions where `Di` can be placed.
   - Hence, the recurrence relation is:
     ```plaintext
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (2*i - 1) * i
     ```
     - Multiply by `i` since there are `i` P&D pairs.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the numbers can get large, we will take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to avoid overflow.

### Code
```javascript
var countOrders = function(n) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: 1 way to arrange 0 pickups and deliveries

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * (2 * i - 1) * i % MOD;
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};

// Examples
console.log(countOrders(1)); // Output: 1
console.log(countOrders(2)); // Output: 6
console.log(countOrders(3)); // Output: 90
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - The dynamic programming approach iterates from `1` to `n`, performing constant-time operations (multiplication, modulo).
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - We use an array `dp` of size `n + 1` to store intermediate results.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the upper limit of `n = 500`.
