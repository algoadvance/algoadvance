[Leetcode 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l652)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.

Two trees are duplicates if they have the same structure with the same node values.

### Example 1:

```
           1
         /   \
        2     3
       /     /  \
      4     2    4
           /
          4
          
```
The duplicate subtrees are:

```
        2
       /
      4
      
and

4
```

### Example 2:

```
        2
       / \
      1   1
```

The duplicate subtrees are:

```
1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the binary tree have duplicate node values without having duplicate subtrees?
    - Yes, the duplicate subtrees need to have the same structure and the same node values.
2. What information should be returned?
    - You need to return the root nodes of the duplicate subtrees.
3. Will the tree nodes contain only integer values?
    - Yes, the tree nodes will contain only integer values.

## Strategy

1. Traverse the tree using a postorder traversal (left, right, root).
2. Serialize each subtree into a string representation.
3. Use a hash map to store the frequency of each serialized subtree.
4. The key in the hash map will be the serialized subtree, and the value will be the count of how many times that subtree has been seen so far.
5. If the count is exactly 2, add the root of this subtree to the result list (since finding it again would mean it's a duplicate).
6. Return the result list containing the roots of all duplicate subtrees.

## Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

var findDuplicateSubtrees = function(root) {
    let result = [];
    let map = new Map();

    const traverse = (node) => {
        if (!node) return "#"; // serialize null node as '#'
        
        // Postorder traversal: left, right, root
        let leftSerialization = traverse(node.left);
        let rightSerialization = traverse(node.right);
        
        // Serialize the current subtree
        let serialization = `${node.val},${leftSerialization},${rightSerialization}`;
        
        // Count the serialization in the map
        map.set(serialization, (map.get(serialization) || 0) + 1);
        
        // If a serialization is found twice, add its root to the result
        if (map.get(serialization) === 2) {
            result.push(node);
        }
        
        return serialization;
    }
    
    traverse(root);
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once during the traversal.
  
**Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\) for the map to store the serialized trees and for the recursion stack in the worst case of an unbalanced tree.

This ensures efficient tracking of duplicate subtrees and returns the correct roots of these duplicates.
