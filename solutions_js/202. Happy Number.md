[Leetcode 202. Happy Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l202)
## Problem Statement

To determine if a number is a "happy number", a number is defined as follows:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

### Example
```text
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   - Yes.
2. Should we handle large numbers?
   - The solution should be efficient and not depend on the size of `n` in an impractical way.
3. Is the function signature predefined?
   - Yes, it will be `function isHappy(n: number): boolean`.

## Strategy

1. Create a helper function `getNext(number: number): number` to transform a number to the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. Use a set to track numbers that have already been seen to detect cycles.
3. In a loop, apply the next transformation repeatedly until:
   - The number becomes 1 (return `true`).
   - We detect a cycle by seeing a repeated number (return `false`).

## Implementation

```javascript
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
    // Helper function to compute the sum of squares of digits
    function getNext(number: number): number {
        let totalSum = 0;
        while (number > 0) {
            let digit = number % 10;
            number = Math.floor(number / 10);
            totalSum += digit * digit;
        }
        return totalSum;
    }

    const seenNumbers = new Set();

    while (n !== 1 && !seenNumbers.has(n)) {
        seenNumbers.add(n);
        n = getNext(n);
    }

    return n === 1;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Helper Function (`getNext`)**:
   - Extracts digits of the number.
   - Computes the sum of the squares of the digits.

2. **Main Function (`isHappy`)**:
   - Tracks previously seen numbers in a set to detect cycles.
   - Iteratively transforms the input number using the `getNext` helper function.
   - Stops if 1 is reached or a cycle is detected (previously seen number reappears).

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(k) where `k` is typically significantly smaller than `n` because the number of unique sums of squares of digits a number can have is limited.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k) to store seen numbers in the set until a cycle is detected or 1 is reached.
