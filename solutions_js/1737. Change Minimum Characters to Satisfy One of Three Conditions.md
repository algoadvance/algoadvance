[Leetcode 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1737)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `a` and `b` consisting of lowercase letters, return the minimum number of characters you need to change to satisfy one of the following conditions:
1. Every character in `a` is strictly less than every character in `b` in the alphabet.
2. Every character in `b` is strictly less than every character in `a` in the alphabet.
3. Both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the strings `a` and `b` non-empty? 
   - Yes, the problem guarantee that they are non-empty.
   
2. Should we consider both conditions separately and find out changes for each, then return the minimum of them?
   - Yes, you must evaluate all three conditions independently and return the smallest number of changes required to satisfy any condition.

## Strategy

1. **Condition 1 & 2**:
   - For both conditions 1 and 2, use prefix sums to calculate how many characters in `a` are less than or equal to 'z' and how many in `b` are greater than or equal to 'a'.
   - Use these prefix sums to determine how many characters need to be changed to satisfy the inequality condition.
   
2. **Condition 3**:
   - Count the frequencies of each character in both strings. Then calculate the number of changes required to make all characters in `a` the same and all characters in `b` the same (find the most frequent character in each string and calculate swaps accordingly).

## Code

```javascript
var minCharacters = function(a, b) {
    const fa = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const fb = new Array(26).fill(0);

    for (let char of a) {
        fa[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
    for (let char of b) {
        fb[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    // Calculate the prefix sums for both strings
    const prefixSumA = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const prefixSumB = new Array(26).fill(0);

    prefixSumA[0] = fa[0];
    prefixSumB[0] = fb[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < 26; i++) {
        prefixSumA[i] = prefixSumA[i - 1] + fa[i];
        prefixSumB[i] = prefixSumB[i - 1] + fb[i];
    }

    // Initialize answer to a large number (infinity)
    let minChange = Infinity;

    // Consider the case where all characters in `a` are strictly less than all characters in `b`
    for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        const changesToMakeALess = a.length - prefixSumA[i];
        const changesToMakeBGreater = prefixSumB[i];
        minChange = Math.min(minChange, changesToMakeALess + changesToMakeBGreater);
    }

    // Consider the case where all characters in `b` are strictly less than all characters in `a`
    for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        const changesToMakeBLess = b.length - prefixSumB[i];
        const changesToMakeAGreater = prefixSumA[i];
        minChange = Math.min(minChange, changesToMakeBLess + changesToMakeAGreater);
    }

    // Consider the case where both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter
    const maxFreqA = Math.max(...fa);
    const maxFreqB = Math.max(...fb);
    minChange = Math.min(minChange, (a.length - maxFreqA) + (b.length - maxFreqB));

    return minChange;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m + k) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the strings `a` and `b` respectively, and `k` is the number of unique letters in the alphabet, which is always 26 in this case. The different loops and calculations carried out in the solution execute in linear time relative to the size of the input strings.
