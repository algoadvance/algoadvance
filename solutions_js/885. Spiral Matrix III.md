[Leetcode 885. Spiral Matrix III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l885)
### Problem Statement:

You are given `R` rows and `C` columns representing a grid. You start at the coordinate `(r0, c0)` and you need to locate all the cells of the grid in a spiral order.

Return all cells in the order they are visited as an array of arrays.

**Example:**

```
Input: R = 1, C = 4, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
Explanation: There is only one row and the cells are visited from the left to the right.
```

**Notes:**
1. The order of the cells in the output must be the order in which the cells are visited in a spiral order.
2. You should return `R * C` elements in your answer.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can `R` and `C` be 0? 
   - No, as they cannot represent a meaningful grid.
2. If the start position `r0` and `c0` is out of bounds?
   - We assume the starting position will always be within bounds.
3. Do we have to account for grids with different dimensions like vertical or horizontal?
   - Yes, the function should work for any grid shape as specified by R (rows) and C (columns).

### Strategy:

We will simulate the spiral traversal:
1. Start at `(r0, c0)`.
2. Use a direction array to manage the movement in spiral order.
3. Keep track of the direction and distance of movement usually defined by `steps`.
4. Continue this until we have visited all `R * C` cells.
5. For each move, check if the cell is within grid bounds and add it to the result set if it is.
6. Adjust steps after two moves (right, up) to form the spiral.

### Code:

```javascript
function spiralMatrixIII(R, C, r0, c0) {
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]; // right, down, left, up
    let result = [];
    let step = 1; // steps to move in given direction
    let x = r0;
    let y = c0;
    result.push([x, y]);

    while (result.length < R * C) {
        // Go in each direction twice in the spiral pattern
        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            let dx = directions[i][0];
            let dy = directions[i][1];
            for (let j = 0; j < step; j++) {
                x += dx;
                y += dy;
                // Check if the current cell is within the grid bounds
                if (x >= 0 && x < R && y >= 0 && y < C) {
                    result.push([x, y]);
                }
            }
            // After moving right and left, we increase the number of steps
            if (i % 2 === 1) {
                step++;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is O(R * C) because we visit each cell exactly once. The space complexity is also O(R * C) due to the storage required for the result array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently traverse the grid in a spiral order and collect all the cells as required.
