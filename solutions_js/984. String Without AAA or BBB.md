[Leetcode 984. String Without AAA or BBB](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l984)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `A` and `B`, return any string `S` such that:

- `S` has length `A + B` and contains exactly `A` 'a' letters, and exactly `B` 'b' letters.
- The substring 'aaa' does not occur in `S`.
- The substring 'bbb' does not occur in `S`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if such a string is not possible?**
   - Given any `A` and `B` such that the absolute difference between `A` and `B` is not more than 2, we can always generate such a string. Since the problem guarantees that input is such that it is possible to generate the string, we don't need to handle the impossible case.

2. **Are the characters case-sensitive?**
   - In this problem, we are only dealing with lowercase 'a' and 'b' characters.

3. **Are there any constraints on the inputs `A` and `B`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify constraints on `A` and `B` beyond that they are positive integers and the sum of `A` and `B` defines the length of the string.

### Strategy

1. We will build the string iteratively, ensuring that no `aaa` or `bbb` patterns form.
2. We keep track of the number of consecutive 'a' and 'b' characters to ensure we donâ€™t add three of the same character consecutively.
3. In each iteration, we decide whether to append 'a' or 'b' based on the counts left and the currently formed string.
4. If the last two characters are 'aa', we make sure to append 'b' next (if available), and vice versa.
5. If we can't append one type of character based on the above rules, we fall back to appending the other type.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} A
 * @param {number} B
 * @return {string}
 */
function strWithout3a3b(A, B) {
    let result = [];
    let totalLength = A + B;

    // Helper function to add character and count its addition
    function addCharacter(char, count) {
        result.push(char);
        return count - 1;
    }

    while (A > 0 || B > 0) {
        let len = result.length;
        if (len >= 2 && result[len - 1] === result[len - 2]) {
            // If last two characters are the same, we need to add the other character
            if (result[len - 1] === 'a') {
                B = addCharacter('b', B);
            } else {
                A = addCharacter('a', A);
            }
        } else {
            // Prefer the character which has more remaining instances
            if (A > B) {
                A = addCharacter('a', A);
            } else {
                B = addCharacter('b', B);
            }
        }
    }
    return result.join('');
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(A + B)**. This is because we iterate through a total of `A + B` characters once, appending one character per iteration. The `push` operation on the result array is O(1), so our solution is efficient and runs linearly with respect to the input size.

This should cover the bases for generating the string without `aaa` or `bbb` substrings.
