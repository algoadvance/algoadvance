[Leetcode 1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1771)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Your task is to form a palindrome by choosing some subsequence of characters from `word1` and some subsequence of characters from `word2`. Return the maximum possible length of such a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the length of `word1` or `word2`?
   - Yes, the lengths `n` and `m` of `word1` and `word2`, respectively, are such that `1 <= n, m <= 1000`.
   
2. Can the subsequences be empty?
   - No, the subsequences need to contain at least one character each.

3. Are we considering only lowercase English letters in the input strings?
   - Yes, the input strings `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)**:
   - Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to find the Longest Common Subsequence on the concatenated string `word1 + word2`.
   
2. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Use two-pointer technique on `word1` and `word2` to create the longest possible palindrome by combining subsequences.

3. **DP Definitions**:
   - Define a 3D DP array `dp[i][j][k]` to keep the maximum length of the palindrome for `word1[i:]` and `word2[j:]` with an extra dimension `k` to check whether we are within the same subsequence or switching.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the strategy described above.

```javascript
function longestPalindrome(word1, word2) {
    const n = word1.length;
    const m = word2.length;
    const combined = word1 + word2;
    const len = n + m;

    // Create a 2D DP array to store LCS(Substring[i:j])
    const dp = Array.from({ length: len }, () => Array(len).fill(0));
    
    // Fill DP array: longest palindrome subsequence length for substrings in combined
    for (let subLength = 1; subLength <= len; subLength++) {
        for (let i = 0; i + subLength - 1 < len; i++) {
            const j = i + subLength - 1;
            if (i == j) {
                dp[i][j] = 1;
            } else if (combined[i] == combined[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i + 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    let maxLength = 0;

    // Check subsequences from word1 and word2 to form the maximal palindrome length
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (word1[i] == word2[j]) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 2 + dp[i + 1][n + j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage
let word1 = "cacb";
let word2 = "cbba";
console.log(longestPalindrome(word1, word2));  // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: `O((n + m)^2)` due to the 2D DP array.
- **Time Complexity**: `O((n + m)^2)` for filling up the DP array, with an additional nested loop with time complexity `O(n * m)` to compute the maximum length.

Overall, the combined complexity is approximately `O((n + m)^2)` which should be feasible within the given constraints.
