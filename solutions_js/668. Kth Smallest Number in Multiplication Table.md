[Leetcode 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l668)
### Problem Statement

Given the integers `m` and `n`, you are tasked with finding the `k-th` smallest number in the multiplication table of size `m x n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
    - What are the ranges for `m`, `n`, and `k`?
    - Is `k` guaranteed to be a valid index within the multiplication table of dimensions `m x n`?
2. **Output**:
    - Should the result be an integer representing the `k-th` smallest number in the multiplication table?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach combined with a helper function to count the number of elements less than or equal to a given number in the `m x n` multiplication table:

1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - We set up a binary search for the result in the range `[1, m * n]`.

2. **Counting Function**:
   - For a given number `x`, we need a function that counts how many numbers in the `m x n` multiplication table are less than or equal to `x`. This can be done by iterating through each row and calculating the min value between `n` and `Math.floor(x / i)` for row `i`.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Use the counting function in the binary search to adjust the search range until it narrows down to the k-th smallest number.

### Code

```javascript
function findKthNumber(m, n, k) {
    // Helper function to count number of elements <= x in the multiplication table
    function countLessEqual(x, m, n) {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            count += Math.min(Math.floor(x / i), n);
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    // Binary search for the k-th smallest number
    let low = 1, high = m * n;
    while (low < high) {
        let mid = low + Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (countLessEqual(mid, m, n) < k) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }

    return low;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findKthNumber(3, 3, 5));  // Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Function**: 
   - `countLessEqual(x, m, n)` counts how many numbers in the `m x n` table are less than or equal to `x`.
   
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize `low` to 1 and `high` to `m * n`.
   - Use the mid-point `(low + high) / 2` to split the search range.
   - Adjust the search range based on the count of numbers <= `mid`.
   - Continue until `low` equals `high`, which will be our k-th smallest number.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** This runs in `O(log(m * n))`.
- **Counting Function:** This runs in `O(m)` for each mid-point evaluation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * log(m * n))`. This should be efficient for reasonable values of `m`, `n`, and `k` within typical constraint limits.
