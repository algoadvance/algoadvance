[Leetcode 3077. Maximum Strength of K Disjoint Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3077)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum possible strength of `k` disjoint subarrays, where the strength of an array is defined as the product of all its elements. 

### Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 12
Explanation: We can choose subarrays [2,3] and [4] which have products 6 and 4 respectively. Their sum is 6 + 4 = 10.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the elements in the array positive?**
   - No, elements can be negative as well.

2. **Can the subarrays be of different lengths?**
   - Yes, the subarrays can be of different lengths.

3. **Is order of elements in subarrays important?**
   - Yes, the order of elements should be maintained as in the original array.

4. **Will k always be less than or equal to the length of nums?**
   - Yes, it's assumed k will be valid (i.e., `1 <= k <= nums.length`).

5. **Are overlapping subarrays allowed?**
   - No, the subarrays should be disjoint.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a dynamic programming table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum strength of selecting `j` subarrays from the first `i` elements of the array.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` because we've selected zero subarrays from zero elements.
   - Initialize other values to negative infinity to denote uncalculated states.
   
3. **State Transition:**
   - Iterate over possible end indices of subarrays and calculate maximum products for each possible subarray split.
   - Update dp table using the state transition relation that considers including current element in the existing subarray or starting a new subarray.
   
4. **Result Extraction:**
   - The answer will be the value stored in `dp[n][k]` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.

## Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxStrength(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;
    
    // Initializing dp array
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(k + 1).fill(Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY));
    dp[0][0] = 1; // Base case
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            let product = 1;
            for (let m = i; m >= 1; m--) {
                product *= nums[m - 1];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[m - 1][j - 1] + product);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][k];
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const k = 2;
console.log(maxStrength(nums, k)); // Output: 12
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\) due to the nested loops through the array and subarray splits.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) due to the use of the dynamic programming table.
