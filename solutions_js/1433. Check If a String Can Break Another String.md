[Leetcode 1433. Check If a String Can Break Another String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1433)
### Problem Statement:
Given two strings: `s1` and `s2`, we say `s1` can break `s2` (or vice-versa) if `s1[i] >= s2[i]` (in the sense of ASCII code) for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` (where `n` is the length of the string which is the same for both strings). Determine if either `s1` can break `s2` or `s2` can break `s1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Length**: Are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` always the same?
   - Yes, both `s1` and `s2` have the same length as per the problem statement.

2. **Character Set**: Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, we can assume that the strings contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy:
1. **Sort and Compare**: The main insight here is that if we sort both strings, we can directly compare their characters in a lexicographical order.
2. **Check Constraints**: Once sorted, iterate through the strings and check:
   - If `s1[i] <= s2[i]` for all `i`.
   - If `s1[i] >= s2[i]` for all `i`.
3. If either of the above conditions is true for the entire string, then `s1` can break `s2` or vice versa.

### Code:
Here is a JavaScript implementation of the above strategy.

```javascript
function checkIfCanBreak(s1, s2) {
    // Sort both strings
    let sortedS1 = s1.split('').sort().join('');
    let sortedS2 = s2.split('').sort().join('');
    
    // Check if sortedS1 can break sortedS2 or if sortedS2 can break sortedS1
    let s1CanBreakS2 = true;
    let s2CanBreakS1 = true;
    
    // Iterate through each character
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedS1.length; i++) {
        if (sortedS1[i] < sortedS2[i]) s1CanBreakS2 = false;
        if (sortedS1[i] > sortedS2[i]) s2CanBreakS1 = false;
    }
    
    // Return true if either s1 can break s2 or s2 can break s1
    return s1CanBreakS2 || s2CanBreakS1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkIfCanBreak("abc", "xya")); // Output: true
console.log(checkIfCanBreak("abe", "acd")); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting both strings takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
2. **Comparison**: Comparing the sorted strings takes \(O(n)\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is:
\[O(n \log n + n) \approx O(n \log n)\]

With this approach, we efficiently determine whether one string can break another.
