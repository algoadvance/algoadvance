[Leetcode 2917. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2917)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 2917: "Find the K-or of an Array"

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. The `k-or` of an array is defined as the bitwise OR of all the elements in any subarray of `nums` of length `k`.

Return the maximum value of the `k-or` of the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if `k` is greater than the length of the array?** 
   - Answer: Since any subarray of length `k` greater than the array length is not possible, we can assume that `k` will be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

2. **What kind of values can `nums` contain (e.g., negative numbers, zero)?**
   - Answer: `nums` can be assumed to contain non-negative integers.

3. **Should I handle any specific edge cases?**
   - Answer: For edge case handling, consider scenarios like `nums` being empty or `k` being `1`.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Create variables to track the maximum `k-or` value as we iterate through the array.
   
2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` to calculate the bitwise OR of each subarray of length `k`.
   - Slide the window one element at a time from the start of the array to the end.
   - Calculate the bitwise OR for each window and keep track of the maximum OR value seen.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Using bitwise OR in a sliding window, for each new position, compute the OR by including the next element and excluding the previous.
   - Keep updating the maximum OR value.

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumKOr = function(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length === 0 || k <= 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Variable to hold the max k-or value
    let maxOr = 0;
    let currentOr = 0;

    // Initial computation of the first window (first k elements)
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        currentOr |= nums[i];
    }
    maxOr = currentOr;

    // Slide the window across the array
    for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Include the next element in the window
        currentOr |= nums[i];
        // Exclude the element that is out of the window range
        currentOr &= ~(nums[i - k]);

        // Update the maximum OR value
        maxOr = Math.max(maxOr, currentOr);
    }

    return maxOr;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of the first window:** O(k) — This is to compute the OR for the first window of size `k`.
- **Sliding Window Iteration:** O(n - k) — The sliding window processes each element but effectively does each OR operation in constant time.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n) — Since `k` is typically much smaller than `n`, the main factor is the iteration through the array, hence linear complexity.
