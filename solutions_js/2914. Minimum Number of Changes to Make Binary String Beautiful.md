[Leetcode 2914. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2914)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you can change any '0' in the string to '1' or any '1' in the string to '0'. Your task is to return the minimum number of changes required to make `s` "beautiful". A binary string is considered beautiful if there are no two identical digits next to each other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the binary string?**
   - The string length can vary but you can expect it to be reasonably long, typically up to `10^5`.

2. **What is considered a valid input?**
   - The input will always be a valid binary string containing only '0's and '1's.

3. **More examples of expected output?**
   - Input: "010101" should output 0 because it is already beautiful.
   - Input: "00110" should output 2 because we can make the changes: "01010".

### Strategy

1. We'll consider two possible resulting beautiful strings:
   - A string that starts with '0' and alternates like "010101...".
   - A string that starts with '1' and alternates like "101010...".

2. For each of the above cases, count the number of changes required to convert the given string `s` to each of these patterns.

3. The minimum number of changes between these two cases will be the answer.

### Code

```javascript
function minChangesToMakeBeautiful(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let changesForStartingWith0 = 0;
    let changesForStartingWith1 = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) { // Even index
            if (s[i] !== '0') changesForStartingWith0++;
            if (s[i] !== '1') changesForStartingWith1++;
        } else { // Odd index
            if (s[i] !== '1') changesForStartingWith0++;
            if (s[i] !== '0') changesForStartingWith1++;
        }
    }
    
    return Math.min(changesForStartingWith0, changesForStartingWith1);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minChangesToMakeBeautiful("010101")); // Output: 0
console.log(minChangesToMakeBeautiful("00110"));  // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution processes each character of the string exactly once.
- Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.

This strategy ensures the solution is efficient enough even for the largest input sizes expected in typical problems.
