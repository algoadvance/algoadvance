[Leetcode 394. Decode String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l394)
### Problem Statement

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

### Example:
1. Input: "3[a]2[bc]"
   Output: "aaabcbc"

2. Input: "3[a2[c]]"
   Output: "accaccacc"

3. Input: "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
   Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Nested Encoding**: Do we need to handle multiple levels of nested encoding?
   - Yes, the examples show nested encoding like "3[a2[c]]" which results in "accaccacc".

2. **Character types**: Can `encoded_string` include any character types apart from alphabets?
   - No, based on the examples, only alphabets are encoded, with digits and brackets used for encoding logic.

3. **Handling large inputs**: Is there a maximum input size we should worry about for practical purposes?
   - As per standard LeetCode problems, we can assume inputs can be reasonably large but will fit within standard memory and processing constraints.

### Strategy

To decode the string:
1. Use two stacks: one to keep track of numbers (for repetition counts) and another to keep track of strings.
2. Traverse the input string character by character:
   - If a number is encountered, compute the full number and push it to the number stack.
   - If a '[' is encountered, it indicates the start of an encoded sequence. Push the current working string to the string stack and reset it.
   - If a ']' is encountered, it indicates the end of an encoded sequence. Pop from both stacks and repeat the string formed till now the specified number of times, then append it back to the previous part of the string.
   - If a regular letter is encountered, keep building the current working string.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function decodeString(s) {
    let numStack = [];
    let strStack = [];
    let currentNum = 0;
    let currentStr = '';
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (!isNaN(char)) {
            currentNum = currentNum * 10 + parseInt(char);
        } else if (char === '[') {
            numStack.push(currentNum);
            strStack.push(currentStr);
            currentNum = 0;
            currentStr = '';
        } else if (char === ']') {
            let repeatTimes = numStack.pop();
            let previousStr = strStack.pop();
            currentStr = previousStr + currentStr.repeat(repeatTimes);
        } else {
            currentStr += char;
        }
    }
    
    return currentStr;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is processed exactly once.

### Explanation

1. Iterate over each character of the string `s`.
2. Use stacks to manage nested structures and keep track of the current substring and its corresponding multiplier.
3. Assemble the final decoded string by repeatedly building substrings based on the encoded rules.
