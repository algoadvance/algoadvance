[Leetcode 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l674)
### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (LCIS).

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined as a subsequence where each element is strictly larger than the previous one.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1, 3, 5] with length 3. Even though [1, 3, 5, 7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous since 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
```

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly increasing.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the array contain only integers or can it have other types of elements?**
   - The array will only contain integers.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Yes, it is possible for the array to be empty.

3. **What should be the output if the array is empty?**
   - The output should be 0.

4. **Is there a maximum size for the input array we should consider?**
   - There is no explicitly given maximum size, but typical constraints apply (e.g., length <= 10^4).

5. **Are there any constraints on the integer values in the array?**
   - Not explicitly stated, so we assume they fit within standard integer bounds.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Initialize two variables:
   - `maxLength` to track the maximum length of any increasing subsequence found.
   - `currentLength` to track the length of the current increasing subsequence.
2. Iterate through the array, comparing each element to the previous one.
3. If the current element is greater than the previous, increment the `currentLength`.
4. If it's not, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater, and reset `currentLength` to 1.
5. At the end of the loop, update `maxLength` one more time to account for any increasing subsequence that includes the last element.
6. Return `maxLength`.

### Code

```javascript
function findLengthOfLCIS(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let maxLength = 0;
    let currentLength = 1;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }
    
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We only need to make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space.
