[Leetcode 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l375)
## Problem Statement

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

- I pick a number between `1` and `n`. 
- You have to guess which number I picked.
- Every time you guess wrong, you pay me the amount of money equal to the number you guessed.
- You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Write a function to determine the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: The winning strategy is to choose numbers in the following way:
- If you choose 7 and lose, you pay 7 dollars and your remaining possible guesses are [1,6,8,10]. That means you would hereafter use a strategy to minimize further cost (which we can tackle recursively).
- Choosing numbers in the middle of a given range minimizes the worst-case costs.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the number to be guessed always within the inclusive range `[1, n]`?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Is the goal to minimize the total money spent in the worst-case scenario?**
   - Yes, that's correct.

3. **Are there any other constraints like time limits on function execution?**
   - The typical constraints of maintaining efficient time complexity for large `n` due to the recursive nature should be considered, so optimizing with dynamic programming is ideal.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** We will use a DP table where `dp[start][end]` indicates the minimum cost to guarantee a win for numbers in the range `[start, end]`.
   
2. **Recursive Calculation:** For a given range `[start, end]`, we can try picking any number `k` between `start` and `end`. If we pick `k`, now the costs to guarantee a win in the two resulting subranges `[start, k-1]` and `[k+1, end]` need to be taken into account. The worst-case scenario would then be:
   - `dp[start][end] = min(k + max(dp[start][k-1], dp[k+1][end])) for all k in [start, end]`

3. **Base Cases:**
   - When `start >= end`, the cost is `0` because no guesses are necessary.

4. **Implementation:** We will populate a DP table using the bottom-up approach.

## Code

```javascript
var getMoneyAmount = function(n) {
    // Initialize dp table
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n+1 }, () => Array(n+1).fill(0));
    
    for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let start = 1; start <= n - len + 1; start++) {
            let end = start + len - 1;
            dp[start][end] = Infinity;
            for (let k = start; k <= end; k++) {
                let cost = k + Math.max(
                    k-1 >= start ? dp[start][k-1] : 0,
                    k+1 <= end ? dp[k+1][end] : 0
                );
                dp[start][end] = Math.min(dp[start][end], cost);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[1][n];
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution has a time complexity of `O(n^3)` due to the three nested loops (one for length, one for start, and one for choosing `k`).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n^2)` since we are storing results in a 2D DP table of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`.

This approach ensures that we are always minimizing the cost in the worst-case scenario by leveraging dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems efficiently.
