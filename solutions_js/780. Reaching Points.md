[Leetcode 780. Reaching Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l780)
### Problem Statement

Let's consider the `Reaching Points` problem from LeetCode:

> Given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, you are initially positioned at point `(sx, sy)`. In each move, you can transform the point `(x, y)` to either `(x + y, y)` or `(x, x + y)`.
>
> Return `true` if you can reach the target point `(tx, ty)` from the starting point `(sx, sy)`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Move Clarification**:
   - **Q**: Can we only move to `(x + y, y)` or `(x, x + y)`, or are there other allowed operations?
   - **A**: Yes, those are the only two operations allowed.

2. **Constraints**:
   - **Q**: What are the limits of the integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`?
   - **A**: All integers are non-negative and can be very large (up to \(10^9\)).

### Strategy

To determine if we can reach `(sx, sy)` from `(tx, ty)`, observe we are effectively attempting the reverse process since the operations `+(x + y, y)` and `+(x, x + y)` increase values rapidly:
- From `(tx, ty)`, consider the reverse operations where:
  - From `(tx - ty, ty)` if `tx > ty`
  - From `(tx, ty - tx)` if `ty > tx`

Key insights:
1. If `tx < sx` or `ty < sy`, it is impossible to reach `(sx, sy)`.
2. If `tx == ty`, it is also impossible since one coordinate must be incremented over the other (they cannot be reduced from a single value to `(sx, sy)`).
3. Use modulo operation to speed up the process:
   - If `tx > ty`, transform `tx -= (tx - sx) % ty`
   - If `ty > tx`, transform `ty -= (ty - sy) % tx`
   - This ensures speeds up by reducing repeated work facilitated by Euclidean algorithm (gcd).

### Code

Below is the JavaScript implementation for the aforementioned strategy:

```javascript
function reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty) {
    while (tx >= sx && ty >= sy) {
        if (tx === sx && ty === sy) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (tx > ty) {
            if (ty > sy) {
                tx %= ty;
            } else { 
                // Only possible if (sx, sy) == (tx - k*ty, ty)
                return (tx - sx) % ty === 0;
            }
        } else {
            if (tx > sx) {
                ty %= tx;
            } else {
                // Only possible if (sx, sy) == (tx, ty - k*tx)
                return (ty - sy) % tx === 0;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(\log(\text{max}(tx, ty)))\) because in each iteration we are effectively reducing one of the coordinates significantly by using the modulo operation, leading to a logarithmic number of steps relative to the values of `tx` and `ty`.

### Conclusion

This approach should give an efficient solution to the Reaching Points problem, leveraging mathematical insights to reduce the search space quickly.
