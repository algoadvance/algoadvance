[Leetcode 2733. Neither Minimum nor Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2733)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` containing `n` distinct positive integers, find the integer that is neither the minimum nor the maximum value in the array. If no such value exists, return `-1`. Note that `n` will be at least 3.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - No, according to the problem statement, the array contains distinct integers.
   
2. **What should be returned if the array contains no middle value?**
   - Return `-1` if there's no integer that is neither the minimum nor the maximum.

3. **What is the range of the input size `n`?**
   - The array will always contain at least 3 elements, but there is no mention of an upper range.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. Identify the minimum and maximum values in the array.
2. Iterate through the array to find an integer that is neither the minimum nor the maximum.
3. If such an integer is found, return it. Otherwise, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
var findNeitherMinNorMax = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length < 3) return -1;

    let min = Math.min(...nums);
    let max = Math.max(...nums);

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num !== min && num !== max) {
            return num;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findNeitherMinNorMax([3, 1, 2])); // Output: 2
console.log(findNeitherMinNorMax([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: 2
console.log(findNeitherMinNorMax([10, 20, 30])); // Output: 20
console.log(findNeitherMinNorMax([1, 3])); // Output: -1 (as per constraints this case won't occur)
```

### Time Complexity

- Finding the minimum and maximum values both take `O(n)` time.
- Iterating through the array again to find the neither min nor max element also takes `O(n)` time.
  
Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
