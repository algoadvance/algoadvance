[Leetcode 720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l720)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in `words` that can be built one character at a time by other words in `words`. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - Are all words in `words` unique?
   - Is the input guaranteed to be non-empty?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the solution be optimized for performance or is a simpler implementation acceptable?
   
3. **Character Type:**
   - Are all characters in the strings lowercase English letters?

Without waiting for further clarifications, let's assume:
- All characters are lowercase English letters.
- `words` is a non-empty list of unique strings.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structure:** Use a Set to store the valid prefixes we have encountered.
2. **Sorting:**
   - Sort `words` in lexicographical order first. This ensures that when we encounter words of the same length, we always choose the lexicographically smallest one first.
3. **Building the Solution:**
   - Iterate through the sorted list and keep a set to store words that we can build one character at a time.
   - Check if the prefix of the current word (all characters except the last one) exists in the set of valid words.
   - If it does, add the current word to the set of valid words.
   - Keep track of the longest valid word encountered.

### Code

Here's how we can implement it in JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestWord(words) {
    words.sort();  // Sort words lexicographically
    let validWords = new Set([""]);
    let longest = "";

    for (let word of words) {
        let prefix = word.slice(0, -1);
        if (validWords.has(prefix)) {
            validWords.add(word);
            if (word.length > longest.length) {
                longest = word;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return longest;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** Sorting the list of words lexicographically takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of words.
- **Iteration:** Checking each word and its prefix involves iterating through the list once, which is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(k\) is the average length of the words.
- **Overall Complexity:** The overall time complexity, dominated by sorting, is \(O(n \log n + n \cdot k)\). This is efficient for typical input sizes related to dictionary problems.

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `validWords` Set starts with an empty string as a valid base case.
2. **Sorting:** 
   - Sorting makes sure the longest and lexicographically smallest word is considered correctly.
3. **Iteration:**
   - For each word, check if its prefix exists in the set of valid words.
   - Update the valid words set and longest word accordingly.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest word that can be built one letter at a time from other words in the list.
