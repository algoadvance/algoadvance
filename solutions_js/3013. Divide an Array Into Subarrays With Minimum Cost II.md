[Leetcode 3013. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3013)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers, and an integer `k`. Split the array into **some** number of non-empty subarrays. Your goal is to minimize the sum of the costs incurred from splitting the array.

The cost of splitting an array into `subarray1, subarray2, ..., subarraym` is defined as the sum of the following:
1. Each subarray's length plus `k`.

Return the minimum cost you can achieve.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Split the array into [1, 2], [3]. The cost is (2 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **From the example given, it looks like after each subarray split, a fixed cost `k` and the length of the subarray are added together to form the cost. Is that correct?** 
   - Yes, that is correct.
   
2. **Is there any constraint on the values within the `nums` array and the value of `k`?**
   - Assume the constraints are: 
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
     - `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
     - `1 <= k <= 1000`

## Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` signifies the minimum cost to split the array `nums[0..i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 since there are no costs before starting the array.
   - For each position `i`, calculate the best split point `j` which minimizes the cost by considering the formula: `dp[j] + (i - j + 1) + k` (where `k` is the fixed cost and `(i - j + 1)` is the length of the current subarray).

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - We need to iterate over each `i` from 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is `nums.length`).
   - For each `i`, check subarray splits from all possible `j` (where `0 <= j <= i`).

## Time Complexity:
- The approach involves a nested iteration over the `nums` array resulting in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. With the constraints provided, this should be efficient enough.

## Coding the Solution:

```javascript
function minCost(nums, k) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let dp = Array(n + 1).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            let length = i - j;
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + length + k);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
let k = 1;
console.log(minCost(nums, k)); // Output should be 5
```

This code will calculate the minimum cost to split the array `nums` by using a dynamic programming approach to consider all possible subarray splits and their resulting costs.
