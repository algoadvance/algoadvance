[Leetcode 782. Transform to Chessboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l782)
## Problem Statement

You have an `n x n` binary grid, where `n` is even (0-indexed) and exactly half of the integers in each row and each column are 1's. A grid is considered to be transformed into a chessboard if every two adjacent cells contain different integers (i.e., no two adjacent cells are the same). You are allowed to perform the following operation on the grid:

- Swap any two rows with each other, or
- Swap any two columns with each other.

Return the minimum number of swaps to transform the grid into a chessboard grid. If it is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[0,1,1,0], [1,0,0,1], [1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible sequence of moves:
- Swap row 2 with row 3, [[0,1,1,0], [1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,0], [1,0,0,1]]
- Swap column 1 with column 2, [[0,1,0,1], [1,0,1,0], [0,1,0,1], [1,0,1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The input grid is already a chessboard.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on `n`?
   **A:** Since `n` is even, it can be assumed to be any positive even number within typical computational limits.

2. **Q:** What if the grid cannot be transformed into a chessboard?
   **A:** The problem states that we should return -1 in such cases.

3. **Q:** What types or ranges of values can the elements of the grid contain?
   **A:** The elements of the grid are binary, so they can only be 0 or 1.

## Strategy

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Check if a Transformation is Possible:**
   - The grid should have exactly half 1's and half 0's in each row and each column.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Identify if the rows can be rearranged to fit a valid chessboard pattern.
   - Identify if the columns can be rearranged to fit a valid chessboard pattern.

3. **Swapping Calculations:**
   - Calculate the number of swaps needed for rows to match either of the two valid chessboard row patterns.
   - Calculate the number of swaps needed for columns to match either of the two valid chessboard column patterns.

4. **Combine Swaps:**
   - Combine the swap counts from the rows and columns.
   - Return the minimum number of swaps, unless itâ€™s impossible.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function movesToChessboard(board) {
    const n = board.length;
    
    const linePattern = (line) => line.join("");
    const patternFrequency = new Map();
    
    // Collect row patterns and their frequencies
    for (let row of board) {
        let pattern = linePattern(row);
        patternFrequency.set(pattern, (patternFrequency.get(pattern) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Validating the row patterns
    if (!validChessboardPattern(patternFrequency, n / 2)) return -1;

    const transposedBoard = transpose(board);
    patternFrequency.clear();

    // Collect column patterns by transposing rows
    for (let row of transposedBoard) {
        let pattern = linePattern(row);
        patternFrequency.set(pattern, (patternFrequency.get(pattern) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Validating the column patterns
    if (!validChessboardPattern(patternFrequency, n / 2)) return -1;

    const rowSwaps = calculateSwaps(board, n);
    const colSwaps = calculateSwaps(transposedBoard, n);

    return rowSwaps + colSwaps;
}

function validChessboardPattern(patternFrequency, expectedCount) {
    // There should be exactly 2 different patterns with expectedCount frequency each
    return patternFrequency.size === 2 && [...patternFrequency.values()].every(count => count === expectedCount);
}

function transpose(matrix) {
    return matrix[0].map((_, i) => matrix.map(row => row[i]));
}

function calculateSwaps(board, n) {
    let rowMask = 0, colMask = 0;
    let rowSum = 0, colSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        rowMask ^= board[0][i];
        colMask ^= board[i][0];
        rowSum += board[0][i];
        colSum += board[i][0];
    }

    // Checking for first row validity
    if (![0, n].includes(rowSum) || ![0, n].includes(colSum)) return -1;

    let rowSwaps = 0, colSwaps = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((board[0][i] ^ (i % 2)) !== rowMask) rowSwaps++;
        if ((board[i][0] ^ (i % 2)) !== colMask) colSwaps++;
    }

    if (n % 2 === 0) {
        rowSwaps = Math.min(rowSwaps, n - rowSwaps);
        colSwaps = Math.min(colSwaps, n - colSwaps);
    } else {
        if (rowSwaps % 2 !== 0) rowSwaps = n - rowSwaps;
        if (colSwaps % 2 !== 0) colSwaps = n - colSwaps;
    }

    return (rowSwaps + colSwaps) / 2;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pattern Collection and Validation:**
  - Collecting and validating row and column patterns both take \(O(n^2)\) time.
  
- **Swap Calculation:**
  - Row and column swap calculations are linear with respect to `n`, hence each takes \(O(n)\) time.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which is efficient for reasonable values of `n`.

This solution effectively leverages pattern recognition and swap calculations to derive the minimum number of swaps needed to transform the given grid into a chessboard configuration.
