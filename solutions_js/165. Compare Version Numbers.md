[Leetcode 165. Compare Version Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l165)
## Problem Statement

You are given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, which represent software version numbers. Each version number consists of one or more revisions joined by a dot (`.`). Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Each version number string may be compared to another using the following rules:

1. The version numbers are compared revision by revision starting from the leftmost revision.
2. A revision is considered larger if its integer value is greater.
3. If a revision is shorter or has fewer revisions, treat the missing revisions as zeros.
4. Return the following results based on the comparison:
   - If `version1` > `version2`, return `1`.
   - If `version1` < `version2`, return `-1`.
   - If `version1` == `version2`, return `0`.

### Example:
```
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0

Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1

Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. How should multiple leading zeros be handled in the versions?
   - Leading zeros should be ignored when comparing individual revisions.
2. Should empty versions be considered equivalent to "0"?
   - Yes, an empty version (a missing revision) should be treated as "0".
3. What is the maximum length of the version strings?
   - Assume the maximum length of each version string is within a practical limit for typical software versioning.

## Strategy

1. Split both version strings into arrays using `.` as a delimiter, so we can individually compare each revision.
2. Iterate through the arrays of revisions:
   - Convert each revision to an integer to ignore leading zeros.
   - Compare the integer values of corresponding revisions.
   - If one version string runs out of revisions, treat the missing revisions as zeros.

3. Return `1`, `-1`, or `0` based on the comparison rules specified.

## Code
```javascript
function compareVersion(version1, version2) {
    // Split both version strings into arrays of revisions
    const v1 = version1.split('.');
    const v2 = version2.split('.');
    
    // Determine the maximum length between both arrays of revisions
    const maxLength = Math.max(v1.length, v2.length);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
        // Convert revisions to integers, treating missing revisions as 0
        const rev1 = i < v1.length ? parseInt(v1[i]) : 0;
        const rev2 = i < v2.length ? parseInt(v2[i]) : 0;
        
        // Compare the integer values of the revisions
        if (rev1 > rev2) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (rev1 < rev2) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    // If all revisions are equal, return 0
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the maximum number of revisions in either of the version strings. The operations within the loop are constant time operations. Splitting the version strings takes O(n) time, as does iterating and comparing them.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to storage for the split arrays.
