[Leetcode 2350. Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2350)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `rolls` which represents the results of a series of die rolls, and an integer `k`, representing the number of sides on the die, return the length of the **shortest subsequence** that **cannot** be obtained from `rolls`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the values and lengths of `rolls` and `k`?**
   - Constraints: `1 <= rolls.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= rolls[i] <= k <= 100`.

2. **Is the dice fair, meaning each side can appear with equal probability?**
   - This generally doesn't affect the solution, but we assume it's fair unless specified otherwise.

3. **Is there any specific subsequence format we need to watch out for?**
   - No specific format. We are concerned with ensuring every possible k-length subsequence is rolled at least once.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Task**:
   - We need to find the shortest sequence that is impossible to form as a subsequence in `rolls`.
   - A subsequence can be formed by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Approach**:
   - Track encountered unique elements in the current window of the roll sequences.
   - Every time the set of encountered numbers reach the size `k` (all possible outcomes of the dice), we reset the counter and proceed to the next segment.
   - The number of segments we encounter (plus one) tells us the shortest sequence length that is impossible to get from `rolls`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the unique dice rolls encountered in the current segment.
   - Increment the number of completed sets whenever we gather all `k` numbers.
   - The result will be the count of these completed sets plus one.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} rolls
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var shortestSequence = function(rolls, k) {
    let seen = new Set();
    let completedSets = 0;
    
    for (let roll of rolls) {
        seen.add(roll);
        // Once we've seen all k sides, we completed one possible sequence.
        if (seen.size === k) {
            completedSets += 1;
            seen.clear(); // reset for the next possible sequence.
        }
    }
    
    // The shortest impossible sequence is one more than the number of completed sets.
    return completedSets + 1;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `rolls` array. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where `k` is the number of unique sides of the dice. This is for the set storing the unique sides seen in the current segment.

Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.
