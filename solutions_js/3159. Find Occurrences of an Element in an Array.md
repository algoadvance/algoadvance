[Leetcode 3159. Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3159)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. Your task is to return the number of occurrences of `k` in `arr`.

For example:
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `3`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be the output if `k` is not found in `arr`?
   - **A:** The output should be `0`.

2. **Q:** Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Q:** Can the array be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can be empty. In that case, the output should be `0`.

4. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A:** There are no explicit constraints mentioned, but we will assume it can be large. The solution should be efficient.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem with a simple iteration over the array to count the occurrences of `k`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. If an element matches `k`, increment the counter.
4. Return the counter after finishing the iteration.

This straightforward approach ensures that we cover all elements in the array, and it works efficiently in linear time.

## Code

```javascript
function findOccurrences(arr, k) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === k) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5];
const k = 2;
console.log(findOccurrences(arr, k)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we need to check each element exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
