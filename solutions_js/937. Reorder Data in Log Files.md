[Leetcode 937. Reorder Data in Log Files](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l937)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words. For each log, the first word is an alphanumeric identifier. Then, either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase English letters (`letter-logs`).
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits (`digit-logs`).

You have to reorder the logs such that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log. The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically by their content. If their contents are the same, then they are ordered by their identifiers. Digit-logs should retain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can a log be empty or have invalid formats?**
   - **A: No, each log is valid and contains at least an identifier and one more element (either letters or digits).**

2. **Q: What should we do if two letter-logs have identical content?**
   - **A: If the contents are identical, order them based on their identifiers.**

3. **Q: What should be the behavior when there are no letter-logs or no digit-logs?**
   - **A: If there are only letter-logs or digit-logs, simply return them in the required order as per the rules mentioned.**

4. **Q: Is there a limit on the length or number of logs?**
   - **A: The problem statement does not specify, but typically constraints are within a reasonable range for competitive programming (e.g., length of each log and the number of logs are within manageable limits such as 1000 logs).**

### Strategy

1. Separate the logs into `letter-logs` and `digit-logs`.
2. Sort the `letter-logs` based on two criteria:
   - First by the content after the identifier.
   - If contents are the same, then by the identifier.
3. Combine the sorted `letter-logs` followed by the `digit-logs` in their original order.
4. Return the combined list.

### Code

```javascript
var reorderLogFiles = function(logs) {
    const letterLogs = [];
    const digitLogs = [];

    // Separate logs into letter-logs and digit-logs
    for (let log of logs) {
        const logSplit = log.split(' ');
        const identifier = logSplit[0];
        const rest = logSplit.slice(1).join(' ');

        if (/\d/.test(rest[0])) {
            digitLogs.push(log);
        } else {
            letterLogs.push(log);
        }
    }

    // Sort the letter-logs
    letterLogs.sort((a, b) => {
        const splitA = a.split(' ');
        const splitB = b.split(' ');
        const idA = splitA[0];
        const idB = splitB[0];
        const logA = splitA.slice(1).join(' ');
        const logB = splitB.slice(1).join(' ');

        if (logA < logB) return -1;
        if (logA > logB) return 1;
        if (idA < idB) return -1;
        if (idA > idB) return 1;
        return 0;
    });

    // Combine the letter-logs followed by digit-logs
    return [...letterLogs, ...digitLogs];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Separating Logs**: O(n) where `n` is the number of logs.
- **Sorting Letter-Logs**: O(m log m) where `m` is the number of letter-logs. Sorting involves comparing logs, and in the worst case, comparing involves checking the entire length of the logs.
- **Combining Logs**: O(n), simple array concatenation.

Overall, the dominant factor is the sorting step, making the time complexity **O(m log m)**.
