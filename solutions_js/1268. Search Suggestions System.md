[Leetcode 1268. Search Suggestions System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1268)
## Problem Statement

You are implementing a product suggestion system which suggests at most three product names from a list of `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefixes with `searchWord`. If more than three products are found, return the three lexicographically minimum products. 

Return the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

### Example:
```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= products.length <= 1000
- 1 <= products[i].length <= 3000
- 1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4
- All the strings of `products` are unique.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Should we assume the input products list is unsorted?**
    - Yes.

2. **Do we need to handle any edge cases such as empty inputs explicitly?**
    - No, you can assume that inputs are always within the constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:** First, sort the products list lexicographically.
2. **Prefix Matching:** For each prefix of the `searchWord`, filter out `products` that have the prefix.
3. **Output Constraint:** For each step, return the first three results.

### Steps:

1. Sort the `products` array lexicographically.
2. Initialize an array `result` to store the suggestion lists for each prefix of the `searchWord`.
3. For each letter in `searchWord`:
    - Form the current prefix.
    - Filter the sorted `products` to find products that start with the current prefix.
    - Add the first three matching products to the results array.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} products
 * @param {string} searchWord
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var suggestedProducts = function(products, searchWord) {
    products.sort();  // Step 1

    const result = [];
    let prefix = '';

    for (const char of searchWord) { // Step 2 & 3
        prefix += char;
        const suggestions = [];

        for (const product of products) { // Step 3a
            if (product.startsWith(prefix)) {
                suggestions.push(product);
            }
            if (suggestions.length === 3) {  // Step 3c
                break;
            }
        }
        result.push(suggestions);  // Step 3b & 3d
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** Sorting the products array takes `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of products.
2. **Prefix matching:** For each prefix (of which there are `M` where `M` is the length of `searchWord`), we iterate through the `products` to collect up to 3 matches. The worst-case time complexity per prefix search is `O(N)`, leading to a combined complexity of `O(M * N)` if performed naively. However, the length of the matching operation mitigates this in practical scenarios.

So, the overall time complexity is dominated by `O(N log N + M * N)`.
