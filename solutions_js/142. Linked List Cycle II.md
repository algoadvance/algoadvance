[Leetcode 142. Linked List Cycle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l142)
### Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

**Example:**

1. Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
   Output: node with value 2
   Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
   
2. Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
   Output: node with value 1
   Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
   
3. Input: head = [1], pos = -1
   Output: null
   Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that the list can contain no cycle and I need to handle this?
   - Yes, you should handle both cases where there is a cycle and where there isn't a cycle.

2. Can I modify the linked list nodes' structure during the execution?
   - No, the solution should not modify the linked list.

3. What should I return if the linked list is empty?
   - If the linked list is empty (i.e., `head` is `null`), you should return `null`.

### Strategy

We will use Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect the cycle and find the starting node of the cycle:

1. **Detect if a Cycle Exists:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
   - Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps in each iteration.
   - If `slow` and `fast` meet, it indicates that there is a cycle.

2. **Determine the Start of the Cycle:**
   - Once the cycle is detected, move one pointer to the head and keep the other at the meeting point.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time; the point at which they meet again will be the start of the cycle.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve this problem:

```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
}

var detectCycle = function(head) {
    if (!head) return null;  // If the list is empty, return null
    
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    
    // Step 1: Detect if a cycle exists
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow === fast) {
            // Cycle detected
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the fast pointer reached the end, indicating no cycle
    if (fast === null || fast.next === null) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find the start of the cycle
    slow = head;
    while (slow !== fast) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next;
    }
    
    // Both pointers now meet at the start of the cycle
    return slow;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, all nodes might be visited once to detect the cycle and to find the start of the cycle.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we are using only a constant amount of extra space (two pointers).
