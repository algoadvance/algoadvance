[Leetcode 427. Construct Quad Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l427)
## Problem Statement

Given a `n x n` matrix of integers representing a 2D grid of 0's and 1's, you need to construct a Quad-Tree that describes the matrix. Each node of the Quad-Tree has either four children or zero children. If the node has zero children, it means it's a leaf node:

- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's, and False if it represents a grid of 0's.
- `isLeaf`: True if the node is a leaf node, and False if it has four children.

Write a function that returns the root of the Quad-Tree representing the input matrix.

### Example:
For the grid:
```
[[1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 1, 1]]
```
The Quad-Tree should be:
```
Output: [[1, 1], [1, [2, 0, 1, 1]]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the size of the grid `n x n`? (Typically, powers of 2)
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the grid? (0's and 1's)

2. **Output Format:**
   - How should I structure the output Quad-Tree? Is there a specific way to represent it for ease of testing?

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Division**:
   - We will use a recursive approach to divide the grid into 4 quadrants until we reach uniform sub-grids (all 0's or all 1's).

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the grid size is `1 x 1`, we will create a leaf node.
   - If all values in the current sub-grid are the same, create a leaf node.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Divide the current grid into four quadrants and recursively construct the Quad-Tree for each quadrant.
   - If any of the quadrants are not uniform (i.e., not leaf nodes), create a parent node with these four children.

4. **Representation of Node**:
   - We will use a class `Node` to represent each node in the Quad-Tree with attributes `val`, `isLeaf`, `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, and `bottomRight`.

## Code

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight) {
        this.val = val;
        this.isLeaf = isLeaf;
        this.topLeft = topLeft || null;
        this.topRight = topRight || null;
        this.bottomLeft = bottomLeft || null;
        this.bottomRight = bottomRight || null;
    }
}

function construct(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;

    const constructTree = (x, y, size) => {
        if (size === 1) {
            return new Node(grid[x][y] === 1, true);
        }

        const half = size / 2;

        const topLeft = constructTree(x, y, half);
        const topRight = constructTree(x, y + half, half);
        const bottomLeft = constructTree(x + half, y, half);
        const bottomRight = constructTree(x + half, y + half, half);

        if (topLeft.isLeaf && topRight.isLeaf && bottomLeft.isLeaf && bottomRight.isLeaf &&
            topLeft.val === topRight.val && topLeft.val === bottomLeft.val && topLeft.val === bottomRight.val) {
            return new Node(topLeft.val, true);
        }

        return new Node(false, false, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight);
    };

    return constructTree(0, 0, n);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Construction of the Quad-Tree**:
  - The time complexity is `O(n^2 log n)` where `n` is the dimension of the grid.
  - Each level of recursion processes all `n^2` elements, and there are `log n` levels of recursion.

By following this strategy, we ensure that each sub-grid is processed correctly and efficiently to construct the desired Quad-Tree representation.
