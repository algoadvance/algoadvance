[Leetcode 2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2085)
### Problem Statement

Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - The length of `words1` and `words2` will be at most `1000`.
   - Each word in `words1` and `words2` will consist of lowercase English letters and have a length between `1` and `10`.

2. **Is the comparison case-sensitive?**
   - Since the problem specifies lowercase English letters, the comparison will be case-sensitive.

3. **Can `words1` and `words2` contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, each list can contain duplicate words, and we need to count only those words which appear exactly once in each list.

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences**: We will use two hash maps (or objects in JavaScript) to count occurrences of each word in `words1` and `words2`.
2. **Filter Unique Words**: We will iterate over one of the hash maps and check if the word exists exactly once in both hash maps.
3. **Count Common Words**: We'll maintain a counter to keep track of the number of such common words.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n + m)** where `n` is the length of `words1` and `m` is the length of `words2`, because we are iterating through each list once to count occurrences and then making another pass to compare the counts.

### Code

```javascript
function countWords(words1, words2) {
    // Step 1: Create two hashmaps to count occurrences
    const count1 = {};
    const count2 = {};
    
    // Step 2: Fill count1 with occurrences of words in words1
    words1.forEach(word => {
        count1[word] = (count1[word] || 0) + 1;
    });
    
    // Step 3: Fill count2 with occurrences of words in words2
    words2.forEach(word => {
        count2[word] = (count2[word] || 0) + 1;
    });
    
    // Step 4: Count the common words that appear exactly once in both arrays
    let commonCount = 0;
    for (const word in count1) {
        if (count1[word] === 1 && count2[word] === 1) {
            commonCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return commonCount;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Creating Hash Maps**: We initialize two empty objects `count1` and `count2` to store the frequency of each word in `words1` and `words2` respectively.
      
2. **Counting Words**:
   - We loop through `words1` and increment the count of each word in `count1`.
   - Similarly, we loop through `words2` and increment the count of each word in `count2`.

3. **Finding Common Words**:
   - We iterate through the keys of `count1` and check if each word has a frequency of exactly one in both `count1` and `count2`.
   - If a word meets this criteria, we increment our `commonCount`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, we return the `commonCount` which represents the number of words that appear exactly once in both `words1` and `words2`.

With this approach, we ensure that we efficiently count and compare the words to find those that are common and appear exactly once in each list.
