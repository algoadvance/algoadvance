[Leetcode 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1170)
### Problem Statement
We are given two arrays of strings `queries` and `words`. For each string in each array, we can define a function `f(s)` which counts the frequency of the smallest character in the string `s`.

For each query string in `queries`, we need to determine how many words in `words` have a frequency count greater than that of the query string. Formally, given a query string `q` and a word string `w`, we calculate `f(q)` and `f(w)`, and count how many times `f(w) > f(q)`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: 
- The frequency of the smallest character in `queries[0]` ("cbd") is `f("cbd") = 1` (the character 'b' appears 1 time).
- The frequency of the smallest character in `words[0]` ("zaaaz") is `f("zaaaz") = 3` (the character 'a' appears 3 times).
- Since `f("zaaaz") = 3 > 1 = f("cbd")`, we return `[1]`.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input arrays be empty? 
   - If yes, the expected output would be an empty array.
2. Are all the string elements lower-case alphabets?
   - Yes, as per the problem constraints, strings will contain only lower-case English letters.
3. What are the expected sizes of the input arrays and the maximum lengths of the strings?
   - This is to ensure that the solution is optimized and performs well within the given constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate the Frequency (`f`) Function:** We'll create a helper function to calculate `f(s)` for a given string `s`.
2. **Precompute Frequencies for `words`:** Calculate the frequency for each string in `words` and store the results.
3. **Process Each Query:** For each query string, compute its frequency and count how many frequencies in the `words` array are greater than this value.

### Code
```javascript
function numSmallerByFrequency(queries, words) {
    // Helper function to calculate the frequency of the smallest character
    function f(s) {
        let charFrequency = Array(26).fill(0);
        for (const char of s) {
            charFrequency[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        for (const freq of charFrequency) {
            if (freq > 0) {
                return freq;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Calculate f(w) for each word in words
    let wordsFrequency = words.map(f);
    
    // Sort frequencies to allow binary search
    wordsFrequency.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Function to count elements greater than a given frequency using binary search
    function countGreaterFrequency(freq) {
        let left = 0, right = wordsFrequency.length;
        while (left < right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (wordsFrequency[mid] <= freq) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return wordsFrequency.length - left;
    }
    
    // Calculate results for each query
    return queries.map(query => countGreaterFrequency(f(query)));
}

// Example usage
const queries = ["cbd"];
const words = ["zaaaz"];
console.log(numSmallerByFrequency(queries, words)); // Output: [1]
```

### Time Complexity
1. **f(s) Computation:** Each call to `f(s)` runs in O(n) where n is the length of the string s.
2. **Precompute Frequencies:** Calculating the frequencies for `words` will take O(numWords * maxWordLength).
3. **Sorting Frequencies:** Sorting the frequencies of `words` has a time complexity of O(numWords log numWords).
4. **Binary Search per Query:** Each query requires a binary search which is O(log numWords).
5. **Overall Complexity:** Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(numWords * maxWordLength + numWords log numWords + numQueries * log numWords).

### Conclusion
This approach efficiently computes the requirements and leverages sorting and binary search to ensure optimal performance, making it suitable for scenarios with larger input sizes.
