[Leetcode 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2011)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` which represents the number of operations to be performed on a variable `x`, and an array `operations` containing `n` strings, where each string is either `"--X"`, `"X--"`, `"++X"`, or `"X++"`. Initially, the value of `x` is `0`. The task is to determine the final value of `x` after performing all the operations.

#### Example
- **Input**: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
- **Output**: 1

#### Constraints
- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- Operations[i] will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Is the array of operations guaranteed to be valid and non-empty?
   **A**: Yes, according to the constraints the operations array will contain between 1 and 100 valid strings.
2. **Q**: Do we need to handle any unexpected inputs or operations outside the mentioned four types?
   **A**: No, you can assume that the inputs will only be one of the four specified operations.

### Strategy
1. Initialize `x` to `0`.
2. Iterate through the `operations` array.
3. For each operation:
   - If the operation is `"++X"` or `"X++"`, increment `x` by `1`.
   - If the operation is `"--X"` or `"X--"`, decrement `x` by `1`.
4. Return the final value of `x`.

### Code
```javascript
function finalValueAfterOperations(operations) {
    let x = 0; // Initialize x to 0

    for (let operation of operations) {
        if (operation === "++X" || operation === "X++") {
            x += 1;
        } else if (operation === "--X" || operation === "X--") {
            x -= 1;
        }
    }

    return x;
}

// Example usage:
const operations = ["--X","X++","X++"];
console.log(finalValueAfterOperations(operations)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the function is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of operations. This is because we need to iterate through the list of operations once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for the variable `x`, regardless of the number of operations.
