[Leetcode 2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2448)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `nums` and `cost`, each of length `n`. You can choose any integer `x` and apply it to all elements of the array `nums`. The cost to apply an integer `x` to an element in `nums` is given by the array `cost`.

The goal is to minimize the total cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the array `cost` signify?**
   The `cost[i]` signifies the cost of changing `nums[i]` to any other integer `x`.

2. **Can we assume the values in `nums` and `cost` are positive integers?**
   Yes, typically, problem constraints assure that `nums` and `cost` contain positive integers.

3. **Do we need to handle very large arrays efficiently?**
   Yes, the algorithm should be optimized to handle large arrays within reasonable time.

### Strategy

To minimize the cost to make all elements in the array equal, we need a cost function. It's intuitive to explore making all array elements equal to some common value. 

The potential best common value is most likely around the median of the numbers because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, which is related to our cost function. However, since there's a separate associated cost array, we need to modify our approach to account for it.

1. **Sorting the Arrays:** First, we sort the pairs of (`nums[i]`, `cost[i]`).
2. **Binary Search:** Explore the optimal `x` using binary search, as this helps efficiently narrow down the minimal cost point.
3. **Cost Calculation:** A helper function will compute the cost given a target value `x`.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript solution implementing the strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCost = function(nums, cost) {
    let n = nums.length;
    
    // Create a combined list of (nums, cost) and sort it based on nums
    let combined = nums.map((num, i) => [num, cost[i]]);
    combined.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    // Binary Search for the optimal value
    let prefixSum = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    let costSum = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + combined[i][1];
        costSum[i + 1] = costSum[i] + combined[i][0] * combined[i][1];
    }
    
    const totalCost = x => {
        let idx = combined.findIndex((item) => item[0] >= x);
        if (idx < 0) idx = n;
        
        let leftCost = x * prefixSum[idx] - costSum[idx];
        let rightCost = costSum[n] - costSum[idx] - x * (prefixSum[n] - prefixSum[idx]);
        
        return leftCost + rightCost;
    };
    
    let left = combined[0][0], right = combined[n - 1][0];
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (totalCost(mid) < totalCost(mid + 1)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return totalCost(left);
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** The initial sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Prefix Sum Calculations:** This step is \(O(n)\).
3. **Binary Search:** Each step in the binary search requires evaluating the cost function, which is \(O(n)\), and we'll perform this approximately \(\log(\text{range})\) times, where "range" is the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `nums`

Thus, overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for large inputs.
