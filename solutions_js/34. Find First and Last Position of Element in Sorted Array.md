[Leetcode 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l34)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`. 

Your task is to find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value. 

If the `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the length of the `nums` array?
   - The array's length is between 0 and 100,000.

2. Can the elements in the `nums` array be negative or only positive?
   - The elements can be both negative and positive.

3. Are there duplicates in the array?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

### Strategy:
To achieve the required `O(log n)` time complexity, we will use a binary search approach. 

Here's how we can find the starting and ending positions:

1. **Find the first occurrence of `target`:** 
   - Use binary search to locate the leftmost occurrence of `target`.
   - Adjust the search to continue to the left half even if the middle element matches `target`.

2. **Find the last occurrence of `target`:**
   - Use binary search to locate the rightmost occurrence of `target`.
   - Adjust the search to continue to the right half even if the middle element matches `target`.

Both of these searches will operate independently but use binary search to ensure `O(log n)` time complexity.

### Code:

```javascript
const searchRange = (nums, target) => {
  const findBound = (nums, target, isFirst) => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let bound = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      
      if (nums[mid] === target) {
        bound = mid;
        if (isFirst) {
          right = mid - 1; // Continue searching in the left half
        } else {
          left = mid + 1; // Continue searching in the right half
        }
      } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }
    
    return bound;
  };

  const firstPosition = findBound(nums, target, true);
  if (firstPosition === -1) {
    return [-1, -1]; // target not found
  }
  
  const lastPosition = findBound(nums, target, false);
  
  return [firstPosition, lastPosition];
};

// Example usage:
console.log(searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 8)); // Output: [3, 4]
console.log(searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 6)); // Output: [-1, -1]
console.log(searchRange([], 0));             // Output: [-1, -1]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Binary Search:** Each binary search has a time complexity of `O(log n)`.
- We perform the binary search twice, once for the first position and once for the last position.
- Thus, the total time complexity is `O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n)`.

This results in an efficient solution to find the first and last positions of the target element in a sorted array.
