[Leetcode 2589. Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2589)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [start_i, end_i, duration_i]` indicates that the i-th task can only be completed within the interval from `start_i` to `end_i` (inclusive) and takes exactly `duration_i` amount of time. You need to determine the minimum amount of total time required to complete all tasks.

It is guaranteed that all tasks can be completed within their corresponding intervals.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there overlapping intervals for tasks?**
   Yes, overlapping intervals may occur, but it is guaranteed that every task can be completed within its interval.

2. **Can we assume that the input array `tasks` is not empty?**
   Yes, you can assume that the input `tasks` has at least one task.

3. **Is the order of tasks in the output important?**
   No, the order in which tasks are completed is not important, only the minimum amount of total time needed to complete all tasks matters.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Tasks**: First, sort tasks based on the end time. This ensures we always consider tasks that have the earliest deadline first.
  
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: Use a min-heap to keep track of ongoing tasks. For each task, try to fit it within the allowed interval while ensuring that the total time spent on tasks is minimized.

3. **Use Data Structures**: We'll use a heap to quickly retrieve the current smallest upcoming end time of active tasks.

## Code

Here is the solution implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minTimeToCompleteTasks(tasks) {
    // Sort tasks by the end time
    tasks.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: (task) => task[1] });
    let totalTime = 0;

    for (const [start, end, duration] of tasks) {
        // If the task can fit without exceeding the current time
        totalTime += duration;
        
        // Push the current task into the heap
        minHeap.enqueue([start + duration - 1, duration]); // making end inclusive

        // If the total time exceeds the current end, we need to replace the maximum end 
        // with this new one if it gives a smaller end time.
        if (totalTime > end) {
            const longestTask = minHeap.dequeue().element;
            totalTime -= longestTask[1];
        }
    }

    return totalTime;
}
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **Sorting**: Tasks are sorted by their end time. This helps in making greedy choices to fit tasks within their allowed intervals.
2. **Heap Utilization**: The min-heap is used to track the current tasks. It ensures that if we need to replace a task from the heap due to exceeding the total time, we replace it with the task that has the longest duration running time.
3. **Total Time Calculation**: The total time keeps track of the cumulative time used so far to complete all tasks. Adjustments are made if tasks can be replaced to fit within the allowed intervals.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the tasks**: `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of tasks.
- **Heap operations**: In the worst case where every operation involves a heap insertion and deletion, the complexity will be `O(N log N)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N log N)`.
