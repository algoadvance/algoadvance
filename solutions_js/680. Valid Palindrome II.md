[Leetcode 680. Valid Palindrome II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l680)
## Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, return `true` if the `s` can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Do we need to handle uppercase characters as well?
   - No, the problem states the string consists of lowercase English letters.
   
2. Can the string be empty?
   - No, the constraints specify the length is at least 1.

3. What if the string is already a palindrome?
   - For strings that are already palindromic, the function should return `true`.

## Strategy:

1. **Two-pointer approach**:
    - Use two pointers starting at the beginning (`left`) and end (`right`) of the string.
    - Move the pointers towards each other and compare characters at these pointers.
    - If a mismatch is found, attempt to skip either the left character or the right character and check if the result is a palindrome.

2. **Helper Function**:
    - Use a helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome.

3. **Efficiency**:
    - This approach primarily involves two linear scans of the string, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.

## Code:

```javascript
function validPalindrome(s) {
    // Helper function to check if a substring s[left...right] is a palindrome
    function isPalindrome(s, left, right) {
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] !== s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    let left = 0;
    let right = s.length - 1;

    // Use two pointers to scan from both ends towards the middle
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] !== s[right]) {
            // Check by skipping either left or right character
            return isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right) || isPalindrome(s, left, right - 1);
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    // If the loop completes without finding any mismatched pairs
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The main part of the algorithm involves a single traversal from both ends towards the middle, which is O(n).
- The `isPalindrome` helper function, in the worst case, will run at most twice, each invocation being O(n).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for large inputs up to the constraint limit.

## Explanation:

- The main function `validPalindrome` uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to check if the characters at these positions are the same while converging towards the center.
- On finding a mismatch, the helper function `isPalindrome` checks if the substring remains a palindrome after skipping one character (either from the left or from the right).
- The function returns `true` if the modified string (due to skipping one character) forms a palindrome and `false` if it doesn't.
