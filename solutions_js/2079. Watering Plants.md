[Leetcode 2079. Watering Plants](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2079)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `plants` where `plants[i]` is the amount of water a plant needs, and an integer `capacity` representing the watering can's capacity, determine how many steps you need to take to water all the plants if the following rules are followed:
1. You start at the water body (position `-1`).
2. Each plant needs to be watered in order from left to right.
3. Whenever you water a plant, it takes one step to move to the plant and another step to return to the water body to refill if necessary.
4. Each move from one plant to the next or to refill takes one step.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What if the `capacity` is greater than the maximum amount in the `plants` array?
   - This is fine; it means you can water some or all of the plants before needing to refill.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the `plants` array or the values within it?
   - Typically, constraints would be given, but for the sake of this problem let's assume reasonable limits such as `1 <= plants.length <= 1000` and `1 <= plants[i] <= 1000`.

3. Do we need to account for any other actions apart from moving between plants and refilling?
   - No, we only need to count the steps taken to move between plants and to and from the water body for refills.

### Strategy
1. Initialize counters for the current step count and the current water amount in the can.
2. Iterate over each plant:
   - Check if the current water can water the plant. If yes, simply move to the next plant and decrement the current water.
   - If not, return to the water body, refill, and then move back to the plant to water it.
3. Sum up all the steps taken during the iteration process.

### Code

```javascript
function wateringPlants(plants, capacity) {
    let steps = 0;
    let currentWater = capacity;

    for (let i = 0; i < plants.length; i++) {
        if (plants[i] <= currentWater) {
            steps++;
            currentWater -= plants[i];
        } else {
            steps += (2 * i) + 1;
            currentWater = capacity - plants[i];
        }
    }

    return steps;
}
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize `steps` to 0 and `currentWater` to the initial `capacity`.
2. For each plant in the array:
   - If the current plant can be watered with the water left in the can (`plants[i] <= currentWater`), then move to the plant (`steps++`) and reduce the water in the can by the amount the plant needs (`currentWater -= plants[i]`).
   - If the current plant cannot be watered with the remaining water:
     - Return to the water body and come back to the current plant (`steps += (2 * i) + 1`).
     - Refill the can and decrement the water by the amount needed by the current plant (`currentWater = capacity - plants[i]`).

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of plants. This is because we make one pass through the array and each operation inside the loop is \(O(1)\).
