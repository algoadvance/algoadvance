[Leetcode 1033. Moving Stones Until Consecutive](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1033)
### Problem Statement
You are playing a solitaire game with three stones on a number line. The initial positions of the stones are given by three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `a < b < c`). Your objective is to make the stones consecutive, i.e., rearrange stones at positions `a`, `a+1`, `a+2`.

In each move, you can move one stone to any position between the min and max position of the three stones.

Find the minimum and maximum number of moves to make the stones consecutive.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` be negative? 
   - No, they are always non-negative integers.
2. Are `a`, `b`, and `c` already given in sorted order?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, `a < b < c`.
3. Is it allowed to place more than one stone on the same position?
   - No, each position must be occupied by only one stone.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to consider the distance or gaps between `a`, `b`, and `c`.

1. **Minimum Moves:**
   - If the stones are already consecutive, then 0 moves are needed.
   - If the gap between `a` and `b` is 2 (i.e., one possible position between them) or between `b` and `c` is 2, then only one move is required.
   - Otherwise, at most 2 moves are needed to make the stones consecutive.
   
2. **Maximum Moves:**
   - You can always consider moving one stone at each step to fill the largest gap until the stones are consecutive.
   - Maximum number of moves is the sum of the distances between gaps reduced by 1 (since moving stones serially).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @param {number} c
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var numMovesStones = function(a, b, c) {
    // Sort the stones' positions
    let positions = [a, b, c];
    positions.sort((x, y) => x - y);
    
    let x = positions[0];
    let y = positions[1];
    let z = positions[2];
    
    // Calculating minimum moves
    let minMoves;
    if (z - x === 2) {
        minMoves = 0;
    } else if ((y - x <= 2) || (z - y <= 2)) {
        minMoves = 1;
    } else {
        minMoves = 2;
    }
    
    // Calculating maximum moves
    let maxMoves = (y - x - 1) + (z - y - 1);
    
    return [minMoves, maxMoves];
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting** the positions takes `O(1)` since there are always three positions.
- Calculations to determine min and max moves are done in constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(1)`.

### Explanation
- **Step 1:** We sort the positions `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Step 2:** Based on the gaps between the sorted positions, we determine the minimum number of moves:
  - If the stones are already consecutive (`z - x == 2`), then 0 moves are needed.
  - If there is only one position between any two stones (`y - x <= 2` or `z - y <= 2`), then 1 move is needed.
  - Otherwise, two moves are sufficient.
- **Step 3:** The maximum number of moves involves reducing each gap between the stones to 1 at each move. This is achieved by summing the gaps minus one move for each.
