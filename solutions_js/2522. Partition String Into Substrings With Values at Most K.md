[Leetcode 2522. Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2522)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits from 1 to 9 and an integer `k`. You need to partition the string `s` into the minimum number of substrings such that the numerical value of each substring is less than or equal to `k`. Return the minimum number of substrings needed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `s` always a valid string consisting of digits from 1 to 9?**
   Yes, `s` will always be a valid string of digits from 1 to 9.

2. **What is the range of `k`?**
   The integer `k` will be a positive integer within reasonable limits for a typical interview problem (no more than, say, a few billion).

3. **Is it guaranteed that any substring of `s` will not start with zero?**
   Yes, since the string only contains digits from 1 to 9, there won't be any leading zero.

4. **Can `s` be empty?**
   No, `s` is a non-empty string as per the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with a count of substrings set to 1 (since we need at least one substring). Also, keep a variable to track the current substring numerical value.

2. **Iterate through the string**: Iterate through each character of the string `s`.
    - Convert the current character to a numerical value and append it to the current number (which represents the current substring).
    - Check if this new number exceeds `k`.
        - If it does, increase the count of substrings and reset the current substring value to the digit you just encountered.
        - If it doesn't, update the current substring value to include this digit.

3. **Output the number**: At the end of the iteration, the count will be the minimum number of substrings needed.

### Code

Here is how we can implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minPartitions(s, k) {
    let count = 1; // At least one substring is needed
    let currentValue = 0;

    for (let char of s) {
        let digit = Number(char);
        if (currentValue * 10 + digit > k) {
            // Start a new substring count
            count++;
            currentValue = digit;
        } else {
            // Append the digit to the current number
            currentValue = currentValue * 10 + digit;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We are iterating through each character of the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few variables to keep track of counts and values, regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently split the string into the minimum possible number of substrings without exceeding the value of `k` for any substring.
