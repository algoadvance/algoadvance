[Leetcode 2999. Count the Number of Powerful Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2999)
## Problem Statement

You are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, and you need to return a list of all powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

A powerful integer is an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` where `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

### Requirements:
- List of powerful integers should be unique.
- The result should be returned in any order.

### Example:
```
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= x, y <= 100
- 0 <= bound <= 10^6

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider bound strictly less than bound or less than or equal to?
   - **Less than or equal to bound.**

2. Can x and y be the same?
   - **Yes, x and y can be the same.**

3. What if `bound` is 0?
   - **In that case, no powerful integers can exist as all results will be greater than 0.**

4. Is the result supposed to be sorted?
   - **No, the result can be in any order.**

## Strategy

1. **Iterate with `x` and `y`:**
   - Start with `i = 0` and compute `x^i` until `x^i` exceeds `bound`.
   - For each `x^i`, iterate `j = 0` and compute `y^j` until `y^j` exceeds `bound`.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, compute `x^i + y^j`.
   - If `x^i + y^j` is within the `bound`, store it in a set (to ensure uniqueness).

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where `x` or `y` is 1; since `1^i` is always 1 for any `i`, giving predictable results.

3. **Return results as a list:**
   - Convert the set to a list and return.

## Code

```javascript
function powerfulIntegers(x, y, bound) {
    const powerfulInts = new Set();

    // Loop for x^i
    for (let i = 0; x ** i <= bound; i++) {
        // Loop for y^j
        for (let j = 0; (x ** i) + (y ** j) <= bound; j++) {
            powerfulInts.add((x ** i) + (y ** j));  // Add x^i + y^j to set
            if (y === 1) break;  // If y is 1, y^j will be 1 for all j > 0
        }
        if (x === 1) break;  // If x is 1, x^i will be 1 for all i > 0
    }

    return [...powerfulInts];  // Convert set to array and return
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs `O(log_x(bound))` times since `x^i > bound` determines the end condition.
- The inner loop runs `O(log_y(bound))` times since `y^j > bound` determines the end condition.
- In total, the time complexity is approximately `O((log_x(bound) * log_y(bound)))`, where the base of the logarithms adjusts based on the values of `x` and `y`.

## Example Execution

```javascript
// Example Test Case
console.log(powerfulIntegers(2, 3, 10));  // Output can be [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]

// Edge Case
console.log(powerfulIntegers(1, 1, 0));  // Output []
```
