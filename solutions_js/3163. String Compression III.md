[Leetcode 3163. String Compression III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3163)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the task is to compress the string such that the length of the new string is minimized. The compression algorithm is defined as follows:
- If a character `c` has a consecutive count of `count`, replace these `count` characters with `c` followed by `count` (only if `count` is more than 1).
- You are allowed to delete at most `k` characters from the string.

Return the minimum possible length of the compressed string after deleting at most `k` characters.

### Example
```
Input: s = "aaabcccd", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing "aaabcccd" deleting 2 'c' results in "a3bcd", which has length 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input string composed of only lowercase English letters? 
   - **Assumption:** Yes, it contains only lowercase English letters.
   
2. Can `k` be larger than the length of the string?
   - **Assumption:** No, `k` will always be within the bounds that make sense (0 ≤ k ≤ length of s).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP) to handle the combination of deletions and compressions optimally:

1. **Identify the State**:
   - Let `dp[i][k]` be the minimum length of the compressed string from the first `i` characters of `s` when `k` deletions are allowed.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If there are 0 characters, the length of the compressed string is 0.
   - `dp[0][k] = 0` for all `k`.

3. **Transitions**:
   - Delete the current character. This would mean moving from state `dp[i-1][k-1]` to `dp[i][k]`.
   - Keep the current character and compute the result considering the current sequence and any potential compressions that may result from it.

4. **Compressing**:
   - When we decide to keep a character, determine how many consecutive characters there are and apply the compression rules.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Compressing similar counts can be achieved efficiently by maintaining a frequency count and ensuring we update these counts during state transitions.

## Code

```javascript
var getLengthOfOptimalCompression = function(s, k) {
    const n = s.length;
    
    // Create a DP array where dp[i][k] represents the compressed length 
    // of the first i characters with k deletions allowed.
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(k + 1).fill(Infinity));
    
    // Initial state, no characters, no deletions results in 0 length.
    dp[0][0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let del = 0; del <= k; del++) {
            if (dp[i-1][del] < Infinity) {
                
                // Option 1: Delete the current character
                if (del + 1 <= k) {
                    dp[i][del + 1] = Math.min(dp[i][del + 1], dp[i-1][del]);
                }

                // Option 2: Keep the current character
                // Initialize for this iteration
                let lengthCompressed = 0;
                let freq = 0;

                // Traverse further back to consider different intervals of compression
                for (let j = i; j <= n; j++) {
                    if (s[j - 1] === s[i - 1]) freq++;
                    else lengthCompressed += j - i + 1;

                    const num_len = freq <= 1 ? 0 : freq < 10 ? 1 : (freq < 100 ? 2 : 3);
                    const len_with_char = dp[i-1][del] + 1 + num_len - lengthCompressed;
                    
                    // If still within deletion count, update the compressed length
                    if (j - i + 1 + del <= k) {
                        dp[j][del] = Math.min(dp[j][del], len_with_char);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
};

// Test case
console.log(getLengthOfOptimalCompression("aaabcccd", 2)); // Should output 4
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the implementation is `O(n^3)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This includes iterating through all characters with nested loops for considering deletions and compressions.
- This quadratic approach might get optimized for certain scenarios, but worst-case remains `O(n^3)` due to the nested loops over the potential splits and compressions.
