[Leetcode 1654. Minimum Jumps to Reach Home](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1654)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of non-negative integers `forbidden`, a non-negative integer `a`, a non-negative integer `b`, and a positive integer `x`. Starting at position `0`, you can make some jumps while avoiding the forbidden positions. The goal is to reach the home at position `x`. You can perform the following actions:

1. Move forward by `a` units.
2. Move backward by `b` units, but you can't perform two consecutive backward jumps.

Calculate the minimum number of jumps required to reach home at position `x`. If it is not possible to reach home, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the forward or backward jump lead beyond the position `x` or should it always stay within the bounds?
2. Is there any limit on the range of the positions given the inputs?
3. Can the position `x` be within the list of forbidden positions?

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS) since it explores the shortest path in an unweighted graph. We need to account for:
- Forward and backward jumps.
- Avoiding forbidden positions.
- Ensuring we do not perform two consecutive backward jumps.

We'll use a queue to perform the BFS and a set to keep track of visited positions to prevent cycles and redundant work. Each state in the BFS will consist of the current position and a boolean indicating whether the previous jump was a backward jump.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumJumps(forbidden, a, b, x) {
  const forbiddenSet = new Set(forbidden);
  const queue = [[0, false]]; // [position, backwardJump]
  const visited = new Set(['0,false']);
  let steps = 0;
  const upperBound = Math.max(x, ...forbidden) + a + b; // Upper bound to stop unnecessary searches
  
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let size = queue.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const [position, backwardJump] = queue.shift();

      if (position === x) {
        return steps;
      }

      // Forward jump
      const forward = position + a;
      if (forward <= upperBound && !forbiddenSet.has(forward) && !visited.has(`${forward},false`)) {
        queue.push([forward, false]);
        visited.add(`${forward},false`);
      }

      // Backward jump
      const backward = position - b;
      if (!backwardJump && backward >= 0 && !forbiddenSet.has(backward) && !visited.has(`${backward},true`)) {
        queue.push([backward, true]);
        visited.add(`${backward},true`);
      }
    }
    
    steps++;
  }
  
  return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS solution is O(M + N) where M is the range we go beyond `x` (setting upper_bound) and N is the size of the `forbidden` set. This ensures that even for large `a`, `b`, and `x`, the solution does not perform unnecessary searches far beyond the target.

In essence, we have:
- O(N) operations for visited looks and queue operations.
- O(max forbidden list size + a + b) checking forward and backward operations dynamically constraint by upper bound.
