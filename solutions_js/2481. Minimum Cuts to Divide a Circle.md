[Leetcode 2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2481)
## Problem Statement
A circle is divided using straight lines (chords) that intersect at the center of the circle. Given an integer `n` representing the number of chords, your task is to determine the minimum number of cuts required to divide the circle into exactly `n+1` regions.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed to the solution, let us answer any potential clarifying questions:
1. **What is the minimum value of `n`?**
   - The minimum value of `n` is 0, which means the circle is not divided, and there is only 1 region.
2. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify a maximum value, so we assume it can go up to any integer within reason.
3. **Do the chords have to be straight lines?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that the division is done using straight lines that intersect at the center of the circle.

With these understandings, let us proceed to the solution.

## Strategy 
To determine the minimum number of cuts required to divide the circle into `n+1` regions, we can observe how the number of regions increases with each chord (cut):
- With `0` chords, there is `1` region.
- With `1` chord, there are `2` regions.
- With `2` chords, there are `3` regions.
- With `3` chords, there are `4` regions.
- This pattern occurs because each new chord introduces `1` additional region.

From these observations, we derive that:
- The number of regions = `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of chords.
- Hence, the minimum cuts required to get `k` regions will be `k-1`.

Therefore:
```plaintext
minimumCuts(n) = n
```

The function should return `n` because it's the number of chords provided and it directly corresponds to the required regions minus one.

## Code
Here is the code implementation for this problem in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumCuts = function(n) {
    return n;
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(1)** because it only involves a simple return statement based on the input value, which requires constant time to execute.

This solution is both optimal and straightforward.
