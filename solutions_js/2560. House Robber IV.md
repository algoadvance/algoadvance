[Leetcode 2560. House Robber IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2560)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers representing the amounts of money of each house on a street. Assuming that adjacent houses have a security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

You are also given an integer `k`, which is the number of houses you are allowed to rob. You need to find what is the maximum minimum amount of money you can guarantee after robbing exactly `k` houses in such a way that no two adjacent houses are robbed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the houses array will always have at least `k` houses?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the number of houses `n` will always be greater or equal to `k`.

2. **What should be the result if `k` is zero?**
   - If `k` is zero, the result should be zero since you're not allowed to rob any house.

3. **Is there any constraint on the house amounts?**
   - The house amounts are positive integers, which means each value is greater than zero.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach combined with a greedy algorithm.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Binary Search for the Maximum Minimum Amount:**
   - Use binary search to explore what can be the possible minimum value we can maximize.
   - Initialize the binary search range:
     - `left` as the minimum value of the houses array.
     - `right` as the maximum value of the houses array.

2. **Greedy Check Function:**
   - For a mid value during the binary search, use a greedy algorithm to verify if it's feasible to rob `k` houses such that the minimum amount robbed is at least this mid value.
   - Traverse the houses array, attempt to rob houses while ensuring no two adjacent houses are robbed.
   - If we can successfully rob `k` houses under these constraints, the current mid value is a valid candidate.

3. **Adjust the Binary Search Range:**
   - If the greedy check passes, it means we can consider higher values: move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If it doesn't pass, it means we should consider lower values: move the right pointer to `mid - 1`.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function canRobWithMinimumAmount(houses, k, minAmount) {
    let n = houses.length;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (houses[i] >= minAmount) {
            count++;
            i++; // Skip the next house to maintain the constraint
            if (count >= k) return true;
        }
    }
    
    return count >= k;
}

function houseRobberIV(houses, k) {
    let left = Math.min(...houses);
    let right = Math.max(...houses);
    let result = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (canRobWithMinimumAmount(houses, k, mid)) {
            result = mid; // mid is a valid minimum amount
            left = mid + 1; // try for a larger minimum amount
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // try for a smaller minimum amount
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let houses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let k = 2;
console.log(houseRobberIV(houses, k)); // Output should be the maximum min value you can rob
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The range of values we are searching through is determined by the minimum and maximum values in the houses array.
  - Let's call this range `V`, where `V` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the `houses` array.

- **Greedy Check**: For each binary search step, the greedy check runs a linear scan through the houses array.
  - Hence, the complexity for the greedy check is `O(n)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n log V)`, where `n` is the length of the houses array, and `V` is the range of house values.

This makes the approach efficient and suitable for large inputs.
