[Leetcode 1872. Stone Game VIII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1872)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `stones`, the value of `stones[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` stone.

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. Initially, the score of both players is `0`. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of the following:

* Choose any positive integer `k` (1 <= k <= n - 1).
* Remove the *first* `k` stones from the row.
* Add the sum of the *remaining* stones to the score of the player who made the move.

The game ends when there is only one stone remaining (meaning that no more moves can be made). The player with the highest score wins.

Alice and Bob both play optimally. Return the maximum score difference Alice can achieve if she plays first.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
    - Are there any constraints on the size of the array? (1 ≤ `stones.length` ≤ 10^5)
    - What is the range of values for each stone in the array? (-10^4 ≤ `stones[i]` ≤ 10^4)
    
2. **Score calculation**:
    - When calculating the score, does a player gain the sum of the remaining stones or the removed stones? (Based on the problem, the player adds the sum of the remaining stones to their score.)
    
3. **Optimal play**:
    - Both players are playing optimally to maximize their own scores.

### Strategy
To determine the maximum score difference Alice can achieve, let's break down the solution:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - Calculate the prefix sums of the `stones` array. The prefix sum `prefix[i]` is the sum of the first `i` stones.
    
2. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Use dynamic programming to determine the maximum score difference.
    - Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum difference Alice can achieve starting from the `i-th` stone.

3. **DP Initialization and Recurrence**:
    - The end condition is when only one stone remains.
    - Iterate from the right end and calculate `dp[i]` based on the prefix sums and previously computed `dp` values.

### Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var stoneGameVIII = function(stones) {
    const n = stones.length;
    let prefix = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    prefix[0] = stones[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + stones[i];
    }
    
    // Initially, the score difference is prefix from the second last element
    let dp = prefix[n - 1];
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
        dp = Math.max(dp, prefix[i] - dp);
    }
    
    return dp;
};
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
- Calculating the prefix sums takes `O(n)`.
- The dynamic programming loop also runs in `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

**Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
- Storing the prefix sums array takes `O(n)` space.
