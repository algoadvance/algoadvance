[Leetcode 514. Freedom Trail](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l514)
## Problem Statement

You have a keypad with a string `ring` and another string `key`. Your objective is to spell out the string `key` by rotating the `ring` either clockwise or counterclockwise. Each character of the `ring` can have a one-unit rotational cost either direction. Once you align a character on the `ring` with the "12:00" position (i.e., the first character of the `ring` becomes the target character), you can press a button to type that character, which also costs one move.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of steps to spell out the string `key` from the `ring`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the lengths of `ring` and `key` strings?
       - `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
   - Are there any specific characters allowed for `ring` and `key`?
       - Both strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

2. **Output:**
   - You need to return the minimum number of steps required to spell out the `key`.

## Strategy

The main idea to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s the approach:

1. **State Representation:**
   - Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum steps to spell out `key.substring(i)` with `ring[j]` aligned to the "12:00" position.

2. **Transition between States:**
   - To move from one state to another, iterate through positions in the `ring` and calculate the minimum rotational steps between characters.
   - For each character in `key`, determine the minimum steps to move from the current character of the `ring` to the next character of `key`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - From `dp[i][j]`, compute possible next states `dp[i+1][k]` where `k` is the index of the next character in `key` in the `ring`.

4. **Base Case:**
   - Initialize dp array for the base case where `key` is empty.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Use a dictionary to map characters to their positions in `ring` for quick lookup.

6. **Result:**
   - The result will be the minimum steps in `dp[0][0]` state after considering alignment cost.

## Code

```javascript
var findRotateSteps = function(ring, key) {
    const m = ring.length;
    const n = key.length;

    // Map to store the occurrences of each character in the ring
    const charPos = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (!charPos[ring[i]]) {
            charPos[ring[i]] = [];
        }
        charPos[ring[i]].push(i);
    }

    // dp table where dp[i][j] means the min steps to align key[i] with ring[j] at start
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(m).fill(Infinity));
    
    // Base case
    dp[0].fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (dp[i][j] !== Infinity) {
                // key[i] is the current character we need to align
                const charTargets = charPos[key[i]];

                for (const target of charTargets) {
                    // Calculate the distance for both clockwise and counterclockwise
                    const diff = Math.abs(target - j);
                    const step = Math.min(diff, m - diff);
                    dp[i + 1][target] = Math.min(dp[i + 1][target], dp[i][j] + step + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Answer is the minimum value in the last dp row (last character of key)
    return Math.min(...dp[n]);
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m^2)`
  - The DP table has dimensions `n x m` and for each entry, we may iterate up to `m` positions to perform the state transitions.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)`
  - We use a 2D array dp of size `m x n`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum steps required using dynamic programming principles.
