[Leetcode 56. Merge Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l56)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What should be done if there are no intervals?**
   - **A: Return an empty array.**

2. **Q: Can intervals contain negative numbers or be unsorted?**
   - **A: Yes, intervals can contain negative numbers and they may not be sorted.**

3. **Q: Are the intervals inclusive at both ends?**
   - **A: Yes, the intervals include both the start and end points.**

4. **Q: Can a single interval be provided?**
   - **A: Yes, if there's only one interval, it should be returned as is.**

### Strategy
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the array of intervals by their starting points. If two intervals have the same starting point, sort them by their ending points.
2. **Merging:** Initialize an empty array to store merged intervals. Iterate over the sorted intervals:
   - If the current interval doesn't overlap with the previous interval, add the previous interval to the merged array.
   - Otherwise, merge the current interval with the previous interval by updating the end of the previous interval to be the maximum of its end and the current interval's end.
3. **Final Step:** Add the last interval (after completing the loop) to the merged array.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The time complexity for sorting the intervals is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Merging:** The single pass through the intervals for merging is \(O(n)\).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var merge = function(intervals) {
    if (intervals.length === 0) return [];

    // Step 1: Sort the intervals by their starting point
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Step 2: Initialize the array to hold merged intervals
    const merged = [];
    
    // Initialize the first interval as the starting point
    let currentInterval = intervals[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        // If the current interval overlaps with the next interval, merge them
        if (currentInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]) {
            currentInterval[1] = Math.max(currentInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, push the previous interval to merged and reset currentInterval
            merged.push(currentInterval);
            currentInterval = intervals[i];
        }
    }

    // Push the last interval
    merged.push(currentInterval);

    return merged;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(merge([[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]])); // Outputs [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
console.log(merge([[1,4],[4,5]]));               // Outputs [[1, 5]]
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting by Start Time:** By sorting the intervals by their starting time, we ensure that we can efficiently merge intervals by simply comparing consecutive intervals.
2. **Merging:** We check if the current interval's end overlaps with the next interval's start. If they overlap, we extend the end of the current interval. If not, we push the current interval to the merged intervals and start a new current interval.
3. **Handling the Last Interval:** We ensure that the last interval is added to the merged result outside the loop, after all intervals have been processed.

This approach guarantees that all overlapping intervals are merged efficiently with a clear time complexity and manageable space complexity.
