### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
```javascript
Input: nums = [4, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[4,6], [4,6,7], [4,6,7,7], [4,7], [4,7,7], [6,7], [6,7,7], [7,7]]
```
### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array include negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the problem statement doesn't restrict the values, so negatives are possible.
   
2. **Can the subsequence include repetitive subsequences?**
   - No, according to the problem statement, the subsequences should be unique.

3. **What should be done if the input is an empty array or has only one element?**
   - Since the subsequence requires at least two elements, the output should be an empty array in these cases.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Use a backtracking function to generate all subsequences recursively.
   - Use a set to avoid duplicate subsequences.
   
2. **Detail Steps**:
   - Start with an empty subsequence and traverse the given array.
   - For each element, add it to the current subsequence if it's non-decreasing.
   - Recursively call the backtracking function with the updated subsequence.
   - Stop when the length of the subsequence is at least 2 and add it to the result set.

### Code
```javascript
const findSubsequences = (nums) => {
    const result = new Set();

    const backtrack = (start, path) => {
        if (path.length >= 2) {
            result.add(path.slice().toString());
        }
        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (path.length === 0 || nums[i] >= path[path.length - 1]) {
                path.push(nums[i]);
                backtrack(i + 1, path);
                path.pop();
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack(0, []);
    return Array.from(result, sequence => sequence.split(',').map(Number));
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [4, 6, 7, 7];
console.log(findSubsequences(nums)); // Output as required in the problem statement
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n * n)
  - There are O(2^n) possible subsequences, and converting each subsequence to a string and back to an array takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^n * n)
  - We use a set to store the subsequences, and at most we can have O(2^n) subsequences of length `n`.

By following the outlined strategy and implementing the backtracking algorithm, we ensure to find all unique non-decreasing subsequences efficiently.
