[Leetcode 315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l315)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and you have to return a new array `counts` where `counts[i]` is the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of values in the `nums` array?
   **A:** The values in `nums` could range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
   **A:** The length of the array can be up to `10^4`.

3. **Q:** Can we have negative numbers in the input array?
   **A:** Yes, negative numbers are allowed.

4. **Q:** Should the solution be optimized for time complexity?
   **A:** Yes, an efficient solution is preferred due to the potential size of the array.

### Strategy

- We will use a modified merge sort to efficiently count the number of smaller elements after each element.
- During the merge process, we'll count how many elements from the right array have been placed before each element from the left array.
- This count will be added to our `counts` array at the appropriate indices.

### Code

Below is the JavaScript implementation of the modified merge sort to achieve the desired result:

```javascript
function countSmaller(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const result = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const indexArr = nums.map((num, index) => index);

    function mergeSort(start, end) {
        if (end - start <= 1) return;

        const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        mergeSort(start, mid);
        mergeSort(mid, end);

        const temp = [];
        let i = start, j = mid;
        let rightCount = 0;

        // Merge while counting right side smaller elements
        while (i < mid && j < end) {
            if (nums[indexArr[i]] <= nums[indexArr[j]]) {
                temp.push(indexArr[i]);
                result[indexArr[i]] += rightCount;
                i++;
            } else {
                temp.push(indexArr[j]);
                rightCount++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        // Collect the remaining elements
        while (i < mid) {
            temp.push(indexArr[i]);
            result[indexArr[i]] += rightCount;
            i++;
        }

        while (j < end) {
            temp.push(indexArr[j]);
            j++;
        }

        // Copy sorted temp back to indexArr
        for (let k = start; k < end; k++) {
            indexArr[k] = temp[k - start];
        }
    }

    mergeSort(0, n);

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Each merge step processes pairs of elements and counts the smaller elements, taking linear time \(O(n)\) in the worst case.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the auxiliary arrays used during the merging process.

This ensures the solution is both time and space efficient, handling the worst-case scenarios within reasonable bounds.
