[Leetcode 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l122)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

**Example:**
1. Input: `[7,1,5,3,6,4]`
   Output: `7`
   Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
                Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

2. Input: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
   Output: `4`
   Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                Total profit is 4.

3. Input: `[7,6,4,3,1]`
   Output: `0`
   Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done, i.e. max profit = 0.


## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can prices contain negative values?**
   - No, prices represent the cost of a stock and should be non-negative.

2. **Are we allowed to perform multiple transactions on the same day?**
   - Yes, but you must sell a stock before you can buy it again.

3. **What is the length range of the input array?**
   - The input array can have a length from 1 to 3 * 10^4.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, the key is to capture all the increases between consecutive days. Instead of trying to time the market (finding exact buy and sell points), we'll add up all the increases.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `maxProfit` to 0.
2. Iterate through the prices from day 1 to the last day.
3. If the price of the stock on the current day is higher than the day before, add the difference to `maxProfit`.

This greedy approach ensures we capture every opportunity for profit.

## Code
```javascript
function maxProfit(prices) {
    let maxProfit = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
            maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
        }
    }
    
    return maxProfit;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of prices. We iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
