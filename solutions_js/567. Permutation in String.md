[Leetcode 567. Permutation in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l567)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length. Return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the strings composed only of lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem constraints guarantee that both `s1` and `s2` are composed of lowercase English letters.
   
2. **What should be returned if `s1` is longer than `s2`?**
   - By definition, it's impossible for a longer string to be a permutation of any substring of a shorter string. Thus, return `false` in such cases.

3. **Can the input strings be empty? If so, what should the output be?**
   - According to typical interpretations of such problems, if `s1` is empty, we would return `true` since an empty string can be considered a permutation of any string, including another empty string. If `s2` is empty and `s1` is not, return `false`.

### Strategy
1. **Character Count Array**:
   - Use two fixed-size arrays (of size 26 for each letter in the alphabet) to keep track of character counts for the current window in `s2` and for `s1`.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Slide a window of the length of `s1` over `s2` and update the counts of characters in this window.
   - At each step, compare the character count array of the window with that of `s1`. If they match, return `true`.

3. **Optimized Matching**:
   - Instead of recomputing the count arrays from scratch for each window, adjust the counts incrementally as the window slides.

### Code
```javascript
function checkInclusion(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length > s2.length) return false;

    const s1Count = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const s2Count = new Array(26).fill(0);

    const aCharCode = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    // Initialize the count arrays for the first window
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        s1Count[s1.charCodeAt(i) - aCharCode]++;
        s2Count[s2.charCodeAt(i) - aCharCode]++;
    }

    // Check the first window
    if (arraysAreEqual(s1Count, s2Count)) return true;

    // Sliding window
    for (let i = s1.length; i < s2.length; i++) {
        s2Count[s2.charCodeAt(i) - aCharCode]++;
        s2Count[s2.charCodeAt(i - s1.length) - aCharCode]--;

        if (arraysAreEqual(s1Count, s2Count)) return true;
    }

    return false;
}

function arraysAreEqual(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** Counting characters for `s1` and the first window of `s2` takes `O(m)` where `m` is the length of `s1`.
- **Sliding the window:** Since each slide involves a constant time adjustment of character counts and a constant time comparison of two arrays of size 26, this part is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `s2`.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)` which simplifies to `O(n)` because `m` is at most `n`.

This solution efficiently uses the sliding window technique and fixes the time complexity with respect to the length of the input strings.
