[Leetcode 1954. Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1954)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `neededApples`, return the minimum perimeter of a (square) garden where you can collect at least `neededApples`. The garden is structured such that the apple trees are arranged in concentric square layers, and each additional layer produces more apples.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the exact arrangement of the apples?**
   - Apples only exist on the boundary of each square layer of the garden, where each new layer adds more apples to the perimeter of the square.

2. **Is there a specific pattern in the number of apples produced per layer?**
   - Yes, for a square garden, the nth layer will produce a number of apples proportional to `(2*n + 1)` where `n` is the layer number.

### Strategy

1. **Define the Problem in Layers:**
   - Each additional layer `k` increases the number of apples gathered.
   - We need to find the smallest `k` such that the cumulative number of apples from all layers is at least `neededApples`.

2. **Calculate Apples per Layer:**
   - The total apples collected up to layer `k` (in a square garden) can be found using a derived formula.
   - Use the formula for total apples from concentric square layers and find the minimum `k` that satisfies or exceeds `neededApples`.

3. **Determine Perimeter:**
   - Once the correct layer `k` is found, the perimeter of the garden is `8 * k`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} neededApples
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumPerimeter = function(neededApples) {
    let apples = 0;
    let k = 0;
    
    // Continue until we have enough apples
    while (apples < neededApples) {
        k++;
        apples += 12 * k * k;
    }
    
    // The perimeter of the square garden
    return 8 * k;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minimumPerimeter(1)); // 8
console.log(minimumPerimeter(13)); // 8
console.log(minimumPerimeter(1000000000)); // Should return a larger perimeter value
```

### Strategy Explanation and Derivation

1. **Formula Derivation:**
   - For each layer `k`, the number of apples on that layer (`Apples(k)`) can be calculated as `12 * k * k`.
   - This formula is derived considering the square layers contributing linearly with increasing layers.

2. **Checking Total Apples:**
   - Sum the apples from layer 1 to layer `k` until the cumulative sum meets or exceeds `neededApples`.

3. **Perimeter Calculation:**
   - The perimeter grows linearly with layers, specifically `8 * k`.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm mainly involves a while loop increasing linearly with `k` until the cumulative apples reach `neededApples`.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(sqrt(n))` where `n` is the `neededApples`. This is based on incrementing and checking the cumulative sum related to the k-th layer.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no extra space other than simple integer variables is used.
