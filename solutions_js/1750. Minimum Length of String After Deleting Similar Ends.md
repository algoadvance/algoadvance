[Leetcode 1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1750)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. You can delete any number of characters from the beginning of the string and the end of the string such that the string becomes empty or does not contain similar characters at the beginning and end.

Return the minimum length of the resulting string that you can obtain.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string be empty from the start?**
   - Yes, it can be empty.
2. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` can range from 0 to 10^5.
3. **Are there any constraints on the characters within the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` will only consist of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Strategy
1. **Two-Pointer Approach:**
   - We will use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`left`) and the other at the end (`right`) of the string.
   - We will move `left` to the right as long as `s[left]` is equal to the character that `s[right]` points to.
   - Similarly, we will move `right` to the left as long as `s[right]` is equal to the character that `s[left]` points to.
   - Continue this process until `left` surpasses `right` or until the characters `s[left]` and `s[right]` differ.
2. **Return the length:**
   - The length of the resulting string will be `right - left + 1`.

### Code
```javascript
function minimumLength(s) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = s.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right && s[left] === s[right]) {
        const char = s[left];
        while (left <= right && s[left] === char) {
            left++;
        }
        while (right >= left && s[right] === char) {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return right - left + 1;
}
```

### Explanation
- Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start (0) and `right` at the end (s.length - 1) of the string.
- While `left` is less than `right` and both `s[left]` and `s[right]` are the same:
  - Move `left` to the right ignoring the current character until a different one is found or the pointers cross.
  - Move `right` to the left ignoring the current character until a different one is found or the pointers cross.
- Finally, return the length of the remaining string, which is calculated as `right - left + 1`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are only using a few extra variables.

Use the code and approach above to solve the problem effectively.
