[Leetcode 2321. Maximum Score Of Spliced Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2321)
## Problem Statement
You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

You can choose two integers `left` and `right` where `0 <= left <= right < n` and swap the subarray `nums1[left...right]` with the subarray `nums2[left...right]`.

- For example, if `nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `nums2 = [5,4,3,2,1]` and you choose `left = 1` and `right = 3`, `nums1` becomes `[1,4,3,2,5]` and `nums2` becomes `[5,2,3,4,1]`.

Return the maximum possible sum of either `nums1` or `nums2` after the swap operation.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - The constraints are typical for array problems but should be specified in the problem statement.
  
2. **Can the subarrays to be swapped be of zero length?**
   - As `0 <= left <= right < n`, the smallest subarray will always have at least one element.

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we aim to maximize the sum of either `nums1` or `nums2` after a single optimal subarray swap. This can be broken down into a few steps:

1. Compute the sum of the original arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Find the optimal subarray to swap that maximizes the change between `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. Apply the swap and calculate the new possible sums.

We can use a variant of Kadane's algorithm to determine the best gain we can achieve by swapping subarrays to maximize the sum of each array.

### Algorithm Steps
1. Calculate the total sum of `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Compute the maximum gain by swapping a subarray from `nums1` to `nums2` and vice versa.
3. Adjust the total sum based on the maximum gain found and return the result.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2) {
    function kadaneDiff(arr1, arr2) {
        let maxSoFar = 0, maxEndingHere = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            maxEndingHere += arr2[i] - arr1[i];
            if (maxEndingHere < 0) {
                maxEndingHere = 0;
            }
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
        }
        return maxSoFar;
    }

    const sum1 = nums1.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const sum2 = nums2.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

    const gain1 = kadaneDiff(nums1, nums2);
    const gain2 = kadaneDiff(nums2, nums1);

    return Math.max(sum1 + gain1, sum2 + gain2);
}

// Example usage:
let nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let nums2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];

console.log(maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2));  // Should print the maximum possible sum after optimal subarray swap
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity for this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input arrays. This is because we traverse the array a constant number of times to calculate sums and to apply Kadaneâ€™s algorithm.

This approach is efficient and leverages a known algorithmic technique to find the optimal solution within linear time.
