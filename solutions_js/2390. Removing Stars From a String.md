[Leetcode 2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2390)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters and stars `*`.
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and 100,000.

2. **Guaranteed Validity**:
   - For every star `*` in the string, there is at least one non-star character to its left. This means we don't need to handle cases where stars cannot find a non-star character to remove.

### Strategy

We can iterate over the string, using a stack data structure to help us efficiently manage the removal of the closest non-star characters to the left of each star:
1. We'll push non-star characters onto the stack.
2. Upon encountering a star, we pop the top character from the stack to "remove" the closest non-star character to the left.
3. Finally, we'll construct the resultant string from the characters remaining in the stack.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once.

### Code

Here’s how we can implement this:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
function removeStars(s) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char !== '*') {
            stack.push(char);
        } else if (stack.length > 0) {
            stack.pop();
        }
    }

    return stack.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(removeStars("leet**cod*e")); // Output: "lecoe"
console.log(removeStars("erase*****")); // Output: ""
```

### Explanation

- **Stack Approach**: We use a stack to keep track of characters. For every character that isn’t a star, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a star, we pop the top character from the stack (the closest left non-star character).
- **Result Construction**: After processing all characters, the stack contains the resultant string without any stars and their associated removed characters. We join the elements of the stack to form the final result string.
