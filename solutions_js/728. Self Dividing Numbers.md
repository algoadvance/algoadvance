[Leetcode 728. Self Dividing Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l728)
## Problem Statement:
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

- For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
- Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self-dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
```

Note:
- The boundaries of each input argument are 1 <= left <= right <= 10000.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should we handle edge cases where the digits of the number contain zeros?
   - Yes, any number containing the digit zero is not a self-dividing number.

2. Is the range inclusive of the bounds `left` and `right`?
   - Yes, the range is inclusive.

## Strategy:
1. Create a helper function `isSelfDividing(n)` to check if a given number `n` is self-dividing:
   - Iterate through each digit of the number.
   - If any digit is zero or `n` is not divisible by any digit, return `false`.
   - If all digits are non-zero and `n` is divisible by each digit, return `true`.

2. Use a loop to iterate through the range from `left` to `right`:
   - For each number, use the `isSelfDividing` helper function to check if it's self-dividing.
   - If it is, add it to the result list.

3. Return the result list.

## Time Complexity:
1. The outer loop runs from `left` to `right`, so it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the range.
2. The helper function `isSelfDividing` has a complexity of O(d) where d is the number of digits in the number.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * d), where n is the range of numbers and d is the average number of digits per number.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const selfDividingNumbers = function(left, right) {
    const result = [];

    const isSelfDividing = (num) => {
        let temp = num;
        while (temp > 0) {
            const digit = temp % 10;
            if (digit === 0 || num % digit !== 0) {
                return false;
            }
            temp = Math.floor(temp / 10);
        }
        return true;
    };

    for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if (isSelfDividing(i)) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example Usage:
const left = 1;
const right = 22;
console.log(selfDividingNumbers(left, right)); // Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
```

This solution efficiently checks all numbers in the given range and determines if they are self-dividing, then returns the list of all such numbers.
