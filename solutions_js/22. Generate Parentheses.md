[Leetcode 22. Generate Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l22)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   Typically, for this problem, `n` ranges from 1 to 8 for standard constraints.
   
2. **Are there any specific constraints on the format of the output?**
   The output should be returned as an array of strings, where each string is a valid combination of `n` pairs of parentheses.

3. **Can the input `n` be zero?**
   Yes, if `n` is zero, the output should be an empty array as there are no valid parentheses combinations.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach:

1. **Define a Recursive Backtracking Function**: The function will attempt to build the string of parentheses by keeping track of the count of open and close parentheses used so far.
  
2. **Base Condition**: When the length of the current string is `2 * n`, append the string to the result as it represents a valid combination.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the count of open parentheses used so far is less than `n`, we can add an open parenthesis `'('`.
   - If the count of close parentheses used so far is less than the count of open parentheses, we can add a close parenthesis `')'`.

4. **Backtracking**: Each recursive function call will explore one potential path of the state space.

## Code

```javascript
function generateParenthesis(n) {
    const result = [];

    function backtrack(currentString, open, close) {
        if (currentString.length === 2 * n) {
            result.push(currentString);
            return;
        }

        if (open < n) {
            backtrack(currentString + '(', open + 1, close);
        }
        
        if (close < open) {
            backtrack(currentString + ')', open, close + 1);
        }
    }

    backtrack("", 0, 0);
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(generateParenthesis(3)); // Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is as follows:

1. **Generating Parentheses Strings**:
   - At each step, the function decides between adding '(' or ')'.
   - The number of strings with length `2*n` is catalan number `C(n)`.
   - Therefore, the number of valid combinations is represented by the nth Catalan number, which approximately is \( 4^n / (n * \sqrt{n}) \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - At most, the recursion tree will have depth `2*n` (each '(' or ')' represents one level).
   - Space complexity is `O(2*n)` due to the recursive call stack.

Thus, the time complexity is \( O(4^n / \sqrt{n}) \) and the space complexity is \( O(2*n) \).

This approach ensures that all valid combinations are generated efficiently using a backtracking strategy.
