[Leetcode 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l129)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path can represent a number. An example is the path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123. Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

### Example
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation: 
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, return 12 + 13 = 25.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output if the tree is empty?**
   - The output should be `0`.
2. **What are the constraints on the tree?**
   - Each node in the tree will have a value between `0` and `9`.
   - The tree has at most `1000` nodes.

### Strategy
We'll use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse all paths from the root to the leaves. At each node, we'll keep track of the current number formed by appending that nodeâ€™s value to the path. Once we reach a leaf node, we'll add the formed number to the total sum. 

### Code
```javascript
function sumNumbers(root) {
    function dfs(node, currentSum) {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        // Calculate the new sum formed by the current path
        currentSum = currentSum * 10 + node.val;
        
        // If it's a leaf node, return the currentSum
        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return currentSum;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, continue to traverse the left and right subtrees
        return dfs(node.left, currentSum) + dfs(node.right, currentSum);
    }
    
    return dfs(root, 0);
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree. In the worst case (in the case of a skewed tree), the space complexity can be **O(N)**, but for a balanced tree, it will be **O(log N)**.
