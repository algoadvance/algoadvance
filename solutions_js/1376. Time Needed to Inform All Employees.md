[Leetcode 1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1376)
## Problem Statement

A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee ranging from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company has an ID of `headID`. Each employee has one direct manager given in the `manager` array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID]` is `-1`.

The company also has an array `informTime` where `informTime[i]` is the time it takes for the `i-th` employee to inform all their direct subordinates.

You are tasked with finding the total time needed to inform all employees of a piece of news starting from the headID.

### Example:
Input:
```
n = 6
headID = 2
manager = [2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
informTime = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

Output:
```
1
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= headID < n`
- `manager.length == n`
- `0 <= manager[i] < n`
- `manager[headID] == -1`
- `informTime.length == n`
- `0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there only one headID given in the problem?**
   Yes, there is only one headID for the entire organization.

2. **Is the manager array guaranteed to form a valid tree structure?**
   Yes, the manager array always forms a valid tree structure.

3. **Can there be multiple paths to inform all employees?**
   No, the tree structure guarantees a single path from the head to each employee.

## Code

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime) {
    let adjacencyList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    // Building the tree structure
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (manager[i] !== -1) {
            adjacencyList[manager[i]].push(i);
        }
    }

    // Helper DFS function
    function dfs(currentID) {
        if (adjacencyList[currentID].length === 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        let maxTime = 0;
        for (let subordinate of adjacencyList[currentID]) {
            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, dfs(subordinate));
        }

        return maxTime + informTime[currentID];
    }

    // Start from the headID and calculate the total time
    return dfs(headID);
}

// Example
let n = 6;
let headID = 2;
let manager = [2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2];
let informTime = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0];
console.log(numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime));  // Output: 1
```

## Strategy

1. **Building the Tree Structure**:
   - We first build an adjacency list representation of the company structure using the `manager` array.

2. **DFS to Calculate Time**:
   - We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree.
   - Starting from the `headID`, we compute the time needed to inform all subordinates recursively.
   - For each employee, we calculate the maximum time taken by any of their subordinates and add it to their own informTime.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The result is the time returned from the DFS traversal starting at `headID`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of employees, since we visit each employee exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the adjacency list representation of the tree and the recursion stack in the worst case.
