[Leetcode 845. Longest Mountain in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l845)
### Problem Statement

**845. Longest Mountain in Array**

You may recall that an array `A` is a mountain array if and only if:
- `A.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that:
    - `A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[i - 1] < A[i]`
    - `A[i] > A[i + 1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

Given an array of integers `arr`, return the length of the longest subarray that is a mountain. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the elements in the array be negative or zero?
   **A**: Yes, the array can contain any integer values, including negative numbers and zero.

2. **Q**: What should we return if there are no mountain subarrays in the input?
   **A**: Return `0` if no mountain subarrays are found.

3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   **A**: You can assume the array length `n` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If the length of the array is less than 3, it's impossible to have a mountain, return 0.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - Use a single pass to find potential peaks (i.e., elements `A[i]` that have `A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1]`).

3. **Expand around the peak**:
   - For each peak, expand left until the sequence is no longer strictly increasing.
   - Expand right until the sequence is no longer strictly decreasing.
   - Calculate the length of the mountain and update the maximum length found.

4. **Result**:
   - Return the length of the longest mountain found.

### Code

```javascript
function longestMountain(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    if (n < 3) return 0;

    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) { // Found a peak
            let left = i - 1;
            let right = i + 1;
            
            while (left > 0 && arr[left] > arr[left - 1]) {
                left--;
            }
            while (right < n - 1 && arr[right] > arr[right + 1]) {
                right++;
            }
            
            let currentLength = right - left + 1;
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            
            // Move to the position after the current valley to avoid unnecessary checks
            i = right;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We make a single pass through the array and in the worst case, every element is part of one iteration inside the inner while loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size.
