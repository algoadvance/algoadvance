[Leetcode 2817. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2817)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and two positive integers `x` and `y`.

Your task is to find the minimum absolute difference between values in the array `nums` with the additional constraint that the indices of these values must differ by at least `x` but no more than `y`.

Return the minimum absolute difference found.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [4,3,1,5,9], x = 1, y = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Minimum absolute difference is 2, achieved by the pair of elements at indices (1,3) (with values (3,5)), indices differ by 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values in `nums` guaranteed to be integers?
2. Should we handle cases where the length of `nums` is less than `x`?

Let's assume that `nums` is a non-empty array of integers and the constraints ensure valid inputs where there are sufficient elements to compare based on `x` and `y`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Brute Force Approach:** Iterate over all pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `x <= |i - j| <= y`. For each valid pair, compute the absolute difference and track the minimum value found. This approach could be inefficient with a time complexity of `O(n^2)` but will work as a straightforward solution.

2. **Optimized Approach:** We can optimize the solution by focusing on creating a sliding window or using a deque to maintain a range of valid elements with indices that differ by at least `x` but no more than `y`.

## Code

Here's a solution using the sliding window approach:

```javascript
function minAbsDifference(nums, x, y) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let minDiff = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + x; j <= i + y && j < n; j++) {
            const diff = Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
            }
        }
    }

    return minDiff;
}

// Example usage
console.log(minAbsDifference([4, 3, 1, 5, 9], 1, 2)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach:** The time complexity is `O(n^2)` because in the worst case, we need to check every pair of indices.
- **Optimized Approach:** The optimized approach would generally aim to reduce the number of comparisons using data structures like heaps or deques to maintain the sliding window properties, potentially reducing the time complexity to `O(n log n)`.

For the given problem constraints, the brute force approach is straightforward and sufficient. Further optimizations could be applied based on tighter constraints or performance requirements.
