[Leetcode 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2147)
### Problem Statement

You are given a long corridor represented by a string `corridor`. The string consists of 'P' (plant) and 'S' (seat). You need to calculate the number of ways to divide the corridor into non-empty sections such that each section contains exactly two seats.

The string `corridor` is guaranteed to have at least 2 seats, but it might not be possible to divide the corridor into valid sections.

Write a function `numberOfWays(corridor: string): number` that returns the number of valid ways to achieve this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The length of the corridor string can be large (up to \(10^5\)).
   - The string will always contain at least two 'S' characters.
2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Return the number of valid ways as an integer.
   - If there are no valid ways, return 0.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - A corridor string with many 'P's and exactly two 'S' characters.
   - Corridors with no valid way to divide.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** If the total number of 'S' in the corridor is not even, immediately return 0 as it's impossible to split seats into groups of 2.
2. **Section Identification:**
   - Iterate through the corridor and count the seats.
   - Whenever you encounter 2 seats:
     - Track the index positions in between these seat pairs.
     - Reset the seat count.
3. **Calculating the Ways:**
   - The number of ways to insert dividers between the segments identified with seats.
   - Multiply the possibilities together given each valid partition location.
   - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfWays(corridor) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    let seatIndices = [];
    
    // Collect positions of 'S' in the corridor
    for (let i = 0; i < corridor.length; i++) {
        if (corridor[i] === 'S') {
            seatIndices.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // If the number of seats is odd, return 0
    if (seatIndices.length % 2 !== 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Identify gaps between pairs of 'S'
    let ways = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i < seatIndices.length; i += 2) {
        let gap = seatIndices[i] - seatIndices[i - 1];
        ways = (ways * gap) % MOD;
    }
    
    return ways;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate through the corridor once to find 'S' positions; this takes linear time.
  - Calculating the number of ways by iterating through seat pairs also takes linear time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We store seat indices which in the worst case could be proportional to the length of the corridor.

This solution ensures we efficiently count the number of ways to partition the seats correctly while adhering to the constraints given.
