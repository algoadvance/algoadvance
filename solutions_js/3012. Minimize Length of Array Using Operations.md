[Leetcode 3012. Minimize Length of Array Using Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3012)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You can perform the following operations on the array any number of times:

1. Pick two different indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i, j < nums.length).
2. Set `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + nums[j]`, and remove the element at index `j`.

Return the minimum possible length of the array after performing any number of operations on it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements `i` and `j` be the same in the operation?**
   - No, they must be different indices.
2. **Are there any constraints on the integer values in the array?**
   - No specific constraints on the values, other than they are integers.
3. **Should the operations result in any reduced or transformed array preserving any property about the original?**
   - No, the goal is solely to minimize the length of the array.
4. **Can the values in the array be negative?**
   - Typically, yes, but specifying this might depend on problem variations.

### Strategy

The key insight here is that since we can sum any two elements and remove one, we can think about this problem as grouping elements. To minimize the array’s length, we need to reduce the array as much as possible, potentially focusing on finding and removing duplicates since they don’t add new distinct values. 

1. **Count Distinct Elements**: The minimum length will effectively be the count of distinct values in the array. This is because in the worst-case scenario, you cannot merge two distinct values without creating a new mixed value.
2. **Use a Set**: Using a Set data structure to capture unique elements of the array will help directly give us the count of distinct elements.

Given this, the implementation is straightforward.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function minLength(nums) {
    // Create a Set from the array to capture distinct elements
    const uniqueElements = new Set(nums);
    
    // The size of the set is the minimum possible length
    return uniqueElements.size;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. This comes from iterating through the array to insert elements into the Set.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of distinct elements in the array, because we store the unique elements in a Set.

This solution ensures that we only consider distinct elements, directly yielding the minimum possible length after any operations.
