[Leetcode 3143. Maximum Points Inside the Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3143)
It seems that you mentioned a LeetCode problem number along with a partial problem statement 'Maximum Points Inside the Square-out'. However, this does not appear to correspond to an official LeetCode problem from their catalog. 

We can proceed by generating a hypothetical problem statement based on this partial information by assuming the task involves finding the maximum number of points that can be enclosed in a square. Let's go step by step:

### Problem Statement

Given a set of points in a 2D plane, determine the maximum number of points that can be enclosed within a square of a given length `L`. The sides of the square should be parallel to the x and y axes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the square be rotated, or must its sides remain parallel to the x and y axes?
    - The sides of the square should remain parallel to the x and y axes.
2. Will the points have integer coordinates?
    - Yes, the points will have integer coordinates.
3. Are the points guaranteed to be unique?
    - Yes, each point will be unique.
4. What should the output be if no points are provided?
    - If no points are provided, the output should be 0.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through each point and consider it as one of the corners of the square.
2. Given a point `(x, y)` as a corner, compute the position of the other three corners of a square of side length `L`:
    - Top-left corner: `(x, y)`
    - Top-right corner: `(x+L, y)`
    - Bottom-left corner: `(x, y+L)`
    - Bottom-right corner: `(x+L, y+L)`
3. For each configuration, count the number of points lying inside or on the boundary of the square.
4. Track the maximum number of points found for any square configuration.
5. Return the maximum count.

### Code

Here is the Javascript code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function maxPointsInsideSquare(points, L) {
    let maxCount = 0;
    const n = points.length;

    if (n === 0) return 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const [x1, y1] = points[i];

        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const [x2, y2] = points[j];
            
            // Top-left corner
            let x_min = x1;
            let y_min = y2;
            let count = 0;

            for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                const [px, py] = points[k];
                if (px >= x_min && px <= x_min + L && py >= y_min && py <= y_min + L) {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }

            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }
    }
    return maxCount;
}

// Example usage:
const points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]];
const L = 4;
console.log(maxPointsInsideSquare(points, L)); // Output will depend on the given points and L
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n^3)` where `n` is the number of points.
- We first loop through each pair of points to determine a possible square configuration (`O(n^2)`).
- For each square configuration, we then loop through all points to count how many fall inside the square (`O(n)`).

This provides a brute-force solution that may be optimized further depending on the constraints. For large input sizes, additional optimization techniques may be needed to reduce the computational complexity.
