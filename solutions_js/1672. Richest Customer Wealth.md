[Leetcode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1672)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i`-th customer has in the `j`-th bank account, return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the sum of money in their bank accounts, and the richest customer is the one with the maximum wealth.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, thus return 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 5 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 7 + 3 = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 3 + 5 = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```


### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input?** 
   - A 2D array of integers where each row represents a customer and each column represents a bank account balance.
2. **What is the expected output?**
   - An integer representing the highest wealth among the customers.
3. **Can the array be empty or have a non-uniform size?**
   - The problem does not specify; we will assume that the input is a well-formed non-empty 2D array with uniform rows and columns.

### Strategy
1. Loop through each customer (row in the array).
2. Calculate the sum of each customer's bank accounts.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered during the traversal.
4. Return the maximum sum.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the problem using JavaScript:

```javascript
function maximumWealth(accounts) {
    let maxWealth = 0;

    for (let customer of accounts) {
        let currentWealth = customer.reduce((sum, account) => sum + account, 0);
        maxWealth = Math.max(maxWealth, currentWealth);
    }

    return maxWealth;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumWealth([[1,2,3], [3,2,1]]));  // Output: 6
console.log(maximumWealth([[1,5], [7,3], [3,5]]));  // Output: 10
console.log(maximumWealth([[2,8,7], [7,1,3], [1,9,5]]));  // Output: 17
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of customers and `n` is the number of bank accounts per customer. This is because we iterate through all customers and sum up the elements of each customer's accounts array.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a constant amount of extra space (`maxWealth` variable).
