[Leetcode 1903. Largest Odd Number in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1903)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is a non-empty substring of `num`, or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input string `num`?**
   - The string `num` can be very large, up to 10^5 characters.

2. **Are there any constraints on the input characters?**
   - The input string `num` will consist only of numeric digits ('0'-'9').

3. **What should the function return if no odd numbers are found?**
   - It should return an empty string "".

## Strategy

1. **Identify the characteristic of odd and even numbers:**
   - Odd numbers end with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
   - Even numbers end with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

2. **Approach:**
   - Start iterating from the end of the string `num`.
   - Check each character to see if it is an odd digit.
   - If an odd digit is found, the substring from the start of the string to this character (inclusive) is the largest possible odd-number.
   - Return this substring.
   - If no odd digit is found by the time we finish iterating, return an empty string.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the input string `num`. This is because we potentially need to scan through the entire string once.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code implementing the mentioned strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} num
 * @return {string}
 */
var largestOddNumber = function(num) {
    for (let i = num.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (parseInt(num[i]) % 2 !== 0) {
            return num.slice(0, i + 1);
        }
    }
    return "";
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Loop through the string from the end:**
   - `for (let i = num.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)`: This loop iterates from the last character toward the first.

2. **Check if the current character is an odd digit:**
   - `if (parseInt(num[i]) % 2 !== 0)`: Here, `parseInt` ensures we convert the character to its integer value before checking if it is odd.

3. **Return the appropriate substring:**
   - `return num.slice(0, i + 1)`: If an odd digit is found, return the substring from the beginning of the string to that character (inclusive).

4. **Return an empty string if no odd digit is found:**
   - `return ""`: If no odd digits are found in the entire string, return an empty string as per the problem requirements.

This approach efficiently finds the largest odd-number substring by leveraging the properties of odd and even numbers and avoiding unnecessary computations.
