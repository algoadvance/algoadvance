[Leetcode 67. Add Binary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l67)
### Problem Statement
The problem is to add two binary strings and return their sum (also as a binary string). The input strings are non-empty and contain only the characters '1' or '0'.

**Example:**
1. Input: `a = "11"`, `b = "1"`
   Output: `"100"`
2. Input: `a = "1010"`, `b = "1011"`
   Output: `"10101"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the length of the binary strings?
   **A:** You can assume that the length of strings `a` and `b` is up to `10^4`.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the content of the string other than '0' and '1'?
   **A:** No, the strings only contain the characters '0' and '1'.

3. **Q:** Can the resulting sum be directly converted and manipulated using built-in functions?
   **A:** You should avoid directly converting to and from non-binary values; rather, perform binary addition manually to simulate the process.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can simulate the addition of two binary numbers similar to how we would add decimal numbers.

1. **Reverse the strings** for easier handling from least significant bit to most significant bit.
2. **Iteratively add** the corresponding bits from both strings along with carry:
   - Initialize a carry variable to zero.
   - Add corresponding bits of the two strings. Also, add the carry from the previous step.
   - The resulting bit is `sum % 2` and the new carry is `sum // 2`.
3. Append the final carry (if any) to the result.
4. **Reverse the result** and convert it back to a string to get the final output.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function addBinary(a, b) {
    let i = a.length - 1;
    let j = b.length - 1;
    let carry = 0;
    let result = [];
    
    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
        let sum = carry;
        
        if (i >= 0) {
            sum += parseInt(a[i], 2);
            i--;
        }
        
        if (j >= 0) {
            sum += parseInt(b[j], 2);
            j--;
        }
        
        result.push(sum % 2);
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);
    }
    
    return result.reverse().join('');
}

// Example usage
console.log(addBinary("11", "1"));    // Output: "100"
console.log(addBinary("1010", "1011")); // Output: "10101"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(max(N, M))**, where `N` is the length of string `a` and `M` is the length of string `b`. This is because we iterate over both strings once, and the length of the result is proportional to the length of the longer input string plus one extra bit if there is a carry at the end.

By implementing this approach, we ensure that we are handling the binary addition in an optimal manner while avoiding unnecessary conversions.
