### Problem Statement:

Leetcode 2049: Count Nodes With the Highest Score

You are given a binary tree rooted at node 0 consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array `parents` representing the tree, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since the root does not have a parent, `parents[0] == -1`.

Each node has a score, calculated by the product of the sizes of the subtrees of each child node and the size of the remaining part of the tree. The size of a subtree is defined as the number of nodes in that subtree.

Return the number of nodes that have the highest score.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the structure of the input array `parents`?**
   - Each index `i` in the array `parents` represents node `i`, and the value at `parents[i]` represents the parent of node `i`. The root node will have value `-1` at `parents[0]`.

2. **Can the nodes have multiple children?**
   - Yes, each node can have zero or more children.

3. **Are all nodes connected, making a valid tree?**
   - Yes, the input guarantees that the `parents` array describes a valid binary tree.

### Code:

```javascript
var countHighestScoreNodes = function(parents) {
    const n = parents.length;
    const children = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        children[parents[i]].push(i);
    }

    const subtreeSize = Array(n).fill(1);

    const calculateSubtreeSize = (node) => {
        for (const child of children[node]) {
            subtreeSize[node] += calculateSubtreeSize(child);
        }
        return subtreeSize[node];
    };

    calculateSubtreeSize(0);

    let maxScore = 0;
    let maxScoreCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        let score = 1;
        let remainingNodes = n;
        for (const child of children[i]) {
            score *= subtreeSize[child];
            remainingNodes -= subtreeSize[child];
        }
        if (i !== 0) {
            score *= remainingNodes;
        }

        if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;
            maxScoreCount = 1;
        } else if (score === maxScore) {
            maxScoreCount += 1;
        }
    }

    return maxScoreCount;
};
```

### Strategy:

1. **Tree Representation:** Build an adjacency list (`children`) from the `parents` array to represent the tree structure.
2. **Subtree Size Calculation:** Use Depth First Search (DFS) to calculate the size of each subtree (`subtreeSize` array). This helps in efficient calculation of each node's score.
3. **Score Calculation:** Compute the score for each node. The score is the product of the sizes of its subtrees and the size of the remaining tree (handled with care for non-root nodes).
4. **Track Maximum Score:** Iterate over each node to find the highest score and count how many nodes have this score.

### Time Complexity:

- **Building the Tree:** O(n)
- **Calculating Subtree Sizes:** O(n)
- **Calculating Scores:** O(n)

Overall, the algorithm runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is efficient for typical constraints on such tree problems.
