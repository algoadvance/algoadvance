[Leetcode 2054. Two Best Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2054)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `i-th` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. 

You can choose at most two non-overlapping events to attend such that the sum of their values is maximized.

Return the maximum sum of values that you can get by attending at most two non-overlapping events.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - 1 <= events.length <= 10^5
    - 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9
    - 1 <= valuei <= 10^6

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Return a single integer representing the maximum sum of values.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if there is only one event? (The maximum sum will simply be the value of that event.)
    - What if there are no two non-overlapping events? (The maximum sum may be the value of an individual event if no two distinct events are non-overlapping.)

## Strategy

1. **Sort Events**:
    - Sort the events based on their end day to facilitate the checking of non-overlapping events efficiently.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - For each event, find the maximum value of a previous non-overlapping event using a binary search.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Prefix Max Array**:
    - Use a prefix max array to store the maximum value of events that can be attended by the current day.
    - Iterate each event and for each event, use binary search on the sorted list to determine the best possible previous non-overlapping event.

## Code

```javascript
function maxTwoEvents(events) {
    // Sort events by endDay
    events.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    // dp array where dp[i] will store the max value of events from 0 to i
    const dp = new Array(events.length).fill(0);
    dp[0] = events[0][2];

    for (let i = 1; i < events.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], events[i][2]);
    }

    function binarySearch(endDay) {
        let low = 0, high = events.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            const mid = low + Math.floor((high - low) / 2);
            if (events[mid][1] < endDay) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }

    let maxSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
        const endDay = events[i][0];
        const bestPreviousIndex = binarySearch(endDay);
        const currentEventValue = events[i][2];
        if (bestPreviousIndex !== -1) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentEventValue + dp[bestPreviousIndex]);
        } else {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentEventValue);
        }
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Binary Search**: \(O(\log n)\) for each event, leading to \(O(n \log n)\) in total.
3. **Overall**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and binary search operations.

Thus, the final time complexity is optimal for the given constraints.
