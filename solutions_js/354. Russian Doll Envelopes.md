[Leetcode 354. Russian Doll Envelopes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l354)
### Problem Statement

The problem is known as the "Russian Doll Envelopes".

You are given a list of envelopes represented as pairs of integers `(width, height)`. One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the width and height of the other envelope.

Your task is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can put one inside the other, akin to Russian Dolls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the dimensions of the envelopes positive integers?**
   - Yes, both width and height are positive integers.
   
2. **Can an envelope have the same width but different heights and still be considered different?**
   - Yes, envelopes are distinct, but for the purpose of nesting, one must be strictly larger in both dimensions than the other.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can break it down into two main parts:

1. **Sorting**: 
   - First, sort the envelopes. To do this properly, for the width, sort in ascending order. For heights, sort in descending order if the widths are the same. This way, we avoid cases where envelopes with the same width but different heights could falsely be nested within each other.

2. **Finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**:
   - After sorting, the problem reduces to finding the longest increasing subsequence based on heights. This is because once sorted by width, a valid sequence in heights is sufficient to answer the problem.

Here's the detailed approach:

1. **Sorting the Envelopes**:
    - Sort by width in ascending order.
    - If two envelopes have the same width, sort by height in descending order.
   
2. **Applying LIS on Heights**:
    - With the sorted envelopes, apply the LIS algorithm on the heights to determine the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested.

### Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation based on the outlined strategy:

```javascript
function maxEnvelopes(envelopes) {
    if (envelopes.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Sort envelopes: first by width ascending, then by height descending if widths are equal
    envelopes.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] === b[0]) {
            return b[1] - a[1];
        } else {
            return a[0] - b[0];
        }
    });

    // Initialize the dp array
    const heights = envelopes.map(env => env[1]);
    const dp = [];

    for (let height of heights) {
        let left = 0, right = dp.length;
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (dp[mid] < height) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        if (left >= dp.length) {
            dp.push(height);
        } else {
            dp[left] = height;
        }
    }

    return dp.length;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the envelopes**: O(n log n), where n is the number of envelopes.
- **Finding the LIS**: O(n log n), since each insertion in the `dp` array involves a binary search.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Conclusion

By sorting the envelopes properly and then finding the longest increasing subsequence on the heights, we efficiently determine the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. This approach ensures the solution within a reasonable time frame for large input sizes.
