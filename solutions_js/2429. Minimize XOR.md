[Leetcode 2429. Minimize XOR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2429)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`. Find the integer `x` such that:

1. `0 â‰¤ x`.
2. `The value of (num1 XOR x)` is minimized.
3. The number of set bits (1-bits) in `x` is equal to the number of set bits in `num2`.

Return the integer `x`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Inputs:**
   - Are `num1` and `num2` guaranteed to be positive integers? 
     - *Yes, both are positive integers.*

2. **Outputs:**
   - Is there always a unique solution, or could there be multiple valid `x` values? 
     - *The problem can have a unique or multiple valid solutions, but we should find one such integer `x`.*

### Strategy

To find `x` such that `(num1 XOR x)` is minimized and `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`:

1. **Counting Set Bits in `num2`:**
   - First, determine how many set bits are in `num2`.

2. **Building `x`:**
   - We need to build a number `x` with the same number of set bits as found in `num2`.
   - To minimize the XOR value with `num1`, start copying the set bits from `num1`, from the least significant bit (LSB) to the MSB until the required count is reached.
   - If we exhaust the set bits of `num1` but have not reached the required number of set bits for `x`, set the remaining bits from the LSB up.

### Code

```javascript
function minimizeXOR(num1, num2) {
    // Function to count the number of 1-bits in a number
    const countSetBits = (num) => {
        let count = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            count += num & 1;
            num >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    };

    // Number of set bits in num2
    const count2 = countSetBits(num2);
    
    // Resultant x to build
    let x = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    // Set bits in x to match num1
    for (let i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (num1 & (1 << i)) {
            x |= (1 << i);
            count++;
            if (count === count2) break;
        }
    }
    
    // If not enough bits are set, set remaining bits from LSB up
    if (count < count2) {
        for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if (!(num1 & (1 << i))) {
                x |= (1 << i);
                count++;
                if (count === count2) break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return x;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting set bits:** This takes O(log(num)), which in a 32-bit integer, is a constant time operation.
- **Building `x`:** This involves iterating over a fixed number of bits (32), so it is O(32) which is again constant.

**Overall Complexity:** O(1), since all operations are bounded by a constant number of bits (32 in typical integer representation).

This approach ensures that we find an integer `x` that both minimizes the XOR with `num1` and matches the set bit count with `num2`.
