[Leetcode 1947. Maximum Compatibility Score Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1947)
### Problem Statement
Given two 2D integer arrays `students` and `mentors` where `students[i][j]` and `mentors[i][j]` denote the answer of the i-th student and the j-th mentor to the j-th question, you need to assign each student to one mentor so that the sum of their compatibility scores is maximized.

The compatibility score between a student and a mentor is the number of answers that match for the corresponding questions. Specifically, the compatibility score between the i-th student and the j-th mentor is the sum of all `students[i][k] == mentors[j][k]` for all `k` questions.

Return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size Constraints:** What are the size constraints for `students` and `mentors` arrays? (Typically as per the problem, `students`, and `mentors` will have dimensions up to 8x8).
2. **Values in Arrays:** Can we assume all values in `students` and `mentors` arrays are binaryâ€”either `0` or `1`?

Based on typical constraints and problem descriptions, let's proceed.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate compatibility scores for all possible pairs of students and mentors.
2. Use a backtracking approach to find the best assignment of students to mentors that maximizes the sum of compatibility scores.

We will use a helper function to compute the compatibility score for a student-mentor pair and another function to perform the backtracking.

### Code

```javascript
var maxCompatibilitySum = function(students, mentors) {
    let n = students.length;
    let m = students[0].length;
    let used = Array(n).fill(false);
    let maxSum = 0;

    const calcCompatibility = (student, mentor) => {
        let score = 0;
        for(let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if(student[i] === mentor[i]) {
                score++;
            }
        }
        return score;
    }

    const backtrack = (studentIndex, currentSum) => {
        if (studentIndex === n) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!used[i]) {
                used[i] = true;
                backtrack(studentIndex + 1, currentSum + calcCompatibility(students[studentIndex], mentors[i]));
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, 0);
    return maxSum;
};

// Example usage
let students = [
  [1,1,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,1]
];
let mentors = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,0]
];
console.log(maxCompatibilitySum(students, mentors)); // Output should be the maximum compatibility score sum
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed as follows:
- **Compatibility Calculation:** Calculating compatibility between a student-mentor pair takes \(O(m)\) time, where \(m\) is the number of questions.
- **Backtracking:** In the worst case, there are \(n!\) (factorial of n) permutations of assigning mentors to students. For each permutation, we compute compatibility which takes \(O(mn)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n! \cdot m)\). However, given the constraints (both `students` and `mentors` have dimensions up to 8x8), this approach is feasible within the limits.
