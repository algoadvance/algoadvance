[Leetcode 1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1061)
## Problem Statement

The original problem can be summarized as follows:

You are given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2` and a string `baseStr`. The strings `s1` and `s2` define the equivalence relationship between characters. The goal is to transform each character in `baseStr` to its lexicographically smallest equivalent character based on the equivalence relationships defined by `s1` and `s2`. Two characters `a` and `b` are equivalent if:

- `a` is equivalent to `b` directly or
- There exists a sequence of characters `c1, c2, ..., ck` such that `a` is equivalent to `c1`, `c1` is equivalent to `c2`, ..., `ck` is equivalent to `b`.

Given these relationships, the task is to transform `baseStr` such that each character is replaced by the smallest equivalent character in its equivalence class.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to have the same length?
   - Yes.
2. What is the character range for `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr`?
   - They consist of lowercase English letters only.
3. Can we assume that the inputs are valid as per the problem statement?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to manage the equivalence relationship between the characters.
   - This structure is efficient for finding and merging sets.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the Union-Find for all characters from 'a' to 'z'.
   
3. **Union Operations**:
   - For each pair of characters in `s1` and `s2`, perform a union operation.
   - While unionizing, always link the parent of the larger character to the smaller one to ensure lexicographically smallest character is the parent.

4. **Finding the Smallest Equivalent Character**:
   - For each character in `baseStr`, replace it by finding its root in the Union-Find structure.

5. **Efficient Union-Find Implementation**:
   - Use path compression in the `find` operation to keep the tree flat.
   - Use union by rank to keep the tree shallow, although it may be unnecessary since we always union smaller to larger through the lexicographical order.

## Code Solution

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor() {
        this.parent = {};
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] === undefined) {
            this.parent[x] = x;
        }
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            // Always attach the larger character to the smaller to keep the smallest as representative
            if (rootX < rootY) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            }
        }
    }
}

var smallestEquivalentString = function(s1, s2, baseStr) {
    const uf = new UnionFind();
    
    // Union operations for all pairs of characters in s1 and s2
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        uf.union(s1[i], s2[i]);
    }
    
    // Transform baseStr by finding the smallest equivalent character
    let result = '';
    for (let ch of baseStr) {
        result += uf.find(ch);
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example usage
let s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser";
console.log(smallestEquivalentString(s1, s2, baseStr)); // Output: "makkek"
```

## Time Complexity

- Initializing and performing find/union operations in the Union-Find structure is nearly constant time, \(O(\alpha(N))\), where \(\alpha\) is the Inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly.
- Therefore, performing union operations for all characters in `s1` and `s2` takes \(O(L \alpha(N))\).
- Transforming `baseStr` involves finding the representative for each character, which takes \(O(M \alpha(N))\), where \(M\) is the length of `baseStr`.

Overall time complexity is \(O((L + M) \alpha(N))\).
