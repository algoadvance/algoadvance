[Leetcode 846. Hand of Straights](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l846)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `hand` of size `n` where `hand[i]` represents the number of cards of value `hand[i]`. You are also given an integer `groupSize` which represents the size of the group you must form each time.

Return `true` if you can rearrange the cards into one or more groups such that:

1. Each group has exactly `groupSize` cards.
2. All the cards in each group have consecutive values.

Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values within `hand`?**
   - The values are integers and can be both positive or zero.

2. **What is the range for `groupSize`?**
   - `groupSize` is a positive integer.

3. **Can we assume that duplicates in the `hand` are allowed?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.

4. **Is the input array `hand` sorted?**
   - No, the input array may not be sorted.

5. **Is the length of the `hand` guaranteed to be a multiple of `groupSize`?**
   - No, the length of `hand` is not guaranteed to be a multiple of `groupSize`. 

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**:
    - If `hand.length` is not divisible by `groupSize`, return `false` immediately because it's not possible to divide the cards into groups of size `groupSize`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
    - Use a hashmap (or object) to count the frequency of each card value.

3. **Form Groups**:
    - Use a min heap or a sorted structure to process the smallest card values first.
    - For each card, try to form a group of `groupSize` sequential cards.
    - Deduct the count of each card used in the group from the frequency map.
    - If at any point we can't form a consecutive sequence of `groupSize`, return `false`.

4. **End Condition**:
    - If all cards are grouped successfully, return `true`.

### Code

```javascript
function isNStraightHand(hand, groupSize) {
    if (hand.length % groupSize !== 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Frequency count
    const countMap = {};
    for (const card of hand) {
        countMap[card] = (countMap[card] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Extract unique card values and sort them
    const uniqueCards = Object.keys(countMap).map(Number).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (const card of uniqueCards) {
        const count = countMap[card];
        if (count > 0) {
            // Try to form a group starting with this card
            for (let i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                const currentCard = card + i;
                if (!countMap[currentCard] || countMap[currentCard] < count) {
                    return false;
                }
                countMap[currentCard] -= count;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Counting**: O(n) — We iterate through the `hand` array once to build the frequency map.
2. **Sorting Unique Cards**: O(m log m) — Where `m` is the number of unique cards.
3. **Forming Groups**: O(n) — Essentially, each card is processed once in the worst case.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(n + m log m), where `m` is the number of unique cards, and `n` is the total number of cards.

### Space Complexity

- O(m) — For the hashmap storing the card frequencies and the sorted list of unique cards, where `m` is the number of unique cards.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly check if the cards can be grouped as required.
