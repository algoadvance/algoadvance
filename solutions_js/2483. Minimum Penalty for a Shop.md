[Leetcode 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2483)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is either:

- `'N'` indicating no customer at the `i-th` hour
- `'Y'` indicating a customer at the `i-th` hour

The shop is initially closed and needs to determine the best time to open (from hour `0` to hour `n`) such that the penalty is minimized. 

The penalty is determined as follows:

- When the shop is closed and a customer arrives (`Y`), the penalty increases by 1.
- When the shop is open and there's no customer (`N`), the penalty also increases by 1.

You need to return the best hour to open the shop such that the penalty is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the earliest hour.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum length of the string?
   - The length `n` of the string `customers` is relatively large, let's assume up to `10^5`.

2. **Initial Conditions**: Assume the shop is closed at the start, and we compute for each possible time window starting from 0 to `n`.

3. **Output Specifics**: If multiple hours result in the same penalty, we return the earliest hour.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we need to simulate opening the shop at every possible hour and compute the penalty for each. We'll use prefix sums to keep track of penalties efficiently.

1. **Pre-compute Prefix Sums**:
   - `customer_prefix_sum[i]`: Number of customers (`'Y'`) from the start up to hour `i-1`.
   - `no_customer_prefix_sum[i]`: Number of no customers (`'N'`) from the start up to hour `i-1`.

2. **Compute Penalities Efficiently**:
   - Use these prefix sums to calculate penalties if the shop opens at each hour.

### Code

```javascript
var bestClosingTime = function(customers) {
    const n = customers.length;

    // Prefix sums for 'Y' and 'N'
    let customerY = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    let noCustomerN = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Constructing prefix sums
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (customers[i] === 'Y') {
            customerY[i + 1] = customerY[i] + 1;
            noCustomerN[i + 1] = noCustomerN[i];
        } else {
            customerY[i + 1] = customerY[i];
            noCustomerN[i + 1] = noCustomerN[i] + 1;
        }
    }

    let minPenalty = Infinity;
    let bestHour = 0;

    for (let hour = 0; hour <= n; hour++) {
        // Penalty calculation for opening at `hour`
        let penalty = customerY[n] - customerY[hour] // Count of 'Y' after `hour`
                    + noCustomerN[hour]; // Count of 'N' before `hour`

        if (penalty < minPenalty) {
            minPenalty = penalty;
            bestHour = hour;
        }
    }

    return bestHour;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n), as we iterate through the `customers` string once.
- **Penalty Calculation**: O(n), as we evaluate the penalty for each possible hour.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for input strings of length up to `10^5`.

### Summary

- Use prefix sums to efficiently compute penalties.
- Iterate through possible opening hours to find the hour with the minimum penalty.
- Return the earliest hour in case of a tie.
