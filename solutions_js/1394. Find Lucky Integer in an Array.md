[Leetcode 1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1394)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value. Return the largest lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The frequency of 2 is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The frequency of 3 is 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 500`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range and Constraints:**
   - Can the array contain negative values or zeros? **No, the problem specifies `1 <= arr[i] <= 500`.**
   - What should be returned if there are multiple lucky integers with the same largest value? **We return that value.**

2. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Do I have to worry about time complexity explicitly, or is a straightforward approach acceptable? **A straightforward approach should be fine given the constraints (`1 <= arr.length <= 500` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 500`).**

## Strategy

1. **Create a Frequency Map:**
   - Use a dictionary (or object) to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.

2. **Find Lucky Integers:**
   - Iterate over the frequency map and identify keys (integers) where the key matches its frequency.

3. **Determine the Largest Lucky Integer:**
   - Track the largest lucky integer encountered during the iteration.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If no lucky integers are found, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the largest lucky integer found.

## Code

```javascript
function findLucky(arr) {
    let frequency = {};

    // Count frequencies
    for (let num of arr) {
        frequency[num] = (frequency[num] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Find the largest lucky integer
    let largestLucky = -1;
    for (let num in frequency) {
        if (parseInt(num) === frequency[num]) {
            largestLucky = Math.max(largestLucky, parseInt(num));
        }
    }

    return largestLucky;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(findLucky([2, 2, 3, 4]));      // Output: 2
console.log(findLucky([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])); // Output: 3
console.log(findLucky([2, 2, 2, 3, 3]));   // Output: -1
console.log(findLucky([5, 5, 5, 5, 5]));   // Output: -1
console.log(findLucky([]));                // Output: -1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The code iterates over the array once to count the frequencies (`O(n)`), and then iterates over the keys of the frequency map, which could be at most 500 unique integers (`O(1)` because 500 is constant). Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` for the frequency map in the worst case where all elements in the array are unique.
