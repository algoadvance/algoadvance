[Leetcode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l153)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of unique integers that has been sorted in ascending order and then possibly rotated at an unknown pivot. For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`. You need to find the minimum element in this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - No, all elements are unique.
2. **What should be returned if the array is empty?**
   - This scenario should not occur as per the problem description.
3. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array is guaranteed to be non-empty.

### Strategy:
Since the array is both sorted and rotated, a binary search approach can be utilized to achieve the desired `O(log n)` time complexity. Here is the high-level idea of the approach:
1. Initialize two pointers `low` and `high` representing the bounds of the array.
2. Use a loop to perform a binary search:
    - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
    - Determine if the middle element is the smallest by checking if it is smaller than both its neighbors.
    - If the array's middle element is greater than the element at `high`, this means the smallest value must be in the right portion of the array.
    - If the array's middle element is less than the element at `high`, this means the smallest value is in the left portion of the array including possibly the middle itself.
3. Continue adjusting the bounds until the smallest element is found.

### Code:
```javascript
function findMin(nums) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = nums.length - 1;

    while (low < high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

        // If middle element is greater than the element at high,
        // it means the minimum value is in the right part
        if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, the minimum value could be the middle element
            // or it lies in the left part
            high = mid;
        }
    }

    // At the end of while loop, low should point to the smallest value
    return nums[low];
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` because we are using a binary search approach, halving the search space with each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution effectively finds the minimum element in the array meeting the requirements and constraints provided.
