[Leetcode 2813. Maximum Elegance of a K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2813)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find the subsequence of length `k` such that the sum is maximum and the subsequence is in ascending order. If there are multiple valid subsequences with the same sum, any of them can be returned.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the input array?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the array (positive/negative, duplicates)?
   
2. **Output Details:**
   - What should be the format of the output subsequence (array, space-separated string, etc.)?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the length of the array is less than `k`?
   - What should be returned if all elements are the same?

Assuming typical constraints found in such problems:
- Input array length, `n`, is between 1 and 10^5.
- Elements in the array are integers that may range within standard integer limits (-10^9 to 10^9).
- `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of the array.
- Return the subsequence as an array.

## Strategy

1. **Sort and Select:**
   - Since we need the subsequence to be in ascending order, sorting the array first would make it easier.
   
2. **Greedy Selection:**
   - After sorting the array in descending order (to facilitate the easiest maximum sum selection), select the first `k` elements.
   
3. **Sorting the Result:**
   - Post selection, sort the selected `k` elements in ascending order to meet the subsequence order requirement.

## Implementation

Here's the implementation approach step-by-step:

1. **Sort the array in descending order.**
2. **Select the first `k` elements.**
3. **Sort the selected elements in ascending order.**

```javascript
function maxEleganceSubsequence(nums, k) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array in descending order to prioritize maximum sum elements
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    // Step 2: Select the first k elements
    let subsequence = nums.slice(0, k);

    // Step 3: Sort the selected subsequence in ascending order
    subsequence.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    return subsequence;
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [3, 1, 5, 8, 2, 7, 6];
const k = 4;

console.log(maxEleganceSubsequence(nums, k));
// Expected output: [5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## Time Complexity

1. Sorting the array initially takes `O(n log n)`.
2. Selecting the first `k` elements takes `O(k)` which is effectively `O(n)` in the worst-case scenario.
3. Sorting the `k` elements takes `O(k log k)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the initial sort step, leading to:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the sorting operations.
