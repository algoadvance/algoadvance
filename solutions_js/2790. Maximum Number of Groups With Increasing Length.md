[Leetcode 2790. Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2790)
## Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 2790: **Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length**

You are given an array `grades` of `n` positive integers representing the grades of students in a class. You are required to form groups following these rules:

1. Each group must have a length that is strictly greater than the previous group.
2. All students must be included in exactly one group.
3. The goal is to find the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the elements of the array be re-arranged or do they need to remain in the given order?
   - The problem statement does not mention the order of students in the array, so we can assume that the array can be rearranged.
2. Is there an upper constraint on the length of the grades array?
   - The constraints are not listed in the problem statement here, but typically there will be an upper limit mentioned in the actual problem on LeetCode.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Sort the array of grades to simplify the process of forming groups.
2. **Greedy Approach**: 
   - Start forming groups from the smallest number of students and keep increasing the size with each subsequent group.
   - This problem can be visualized using an analogy similar to forming sums of consecutive integers.
   
   Essentially, we need to find the maximum `k` such that:
   \[1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k \leq n\]
   
   The sum on the left hand side is the triangular number \(T_k = \frac{k (k + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, the condition becomes:
   \[\frac{k (k + 1)}{2} \leq n \]
   
   This simplifies to finding the maximum `k` that satisfies the above condition.

3. **Binary Search or Iterative Check**:
   - One way to find `k` is through iteration from `1` upwards while checking the condition.

## Code
Here is the implementation of the aforementioned strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxGroups(grades) {
    const n = grades.length;

    let k = 0;
    let total_students = 0;

    while (total_students <= n) {
        k++;
        total_students += k;
    }
  
    // When total_students exceeds n, we need to step back one group.
    return k - 1;
}

// Example usage:
// const grades = [10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5];
// console.log(maxGroups(grades)); // Output will depend on the array size which is dynamic.
```

## Explanation
1. **Grades Length**: Find the length of the grades array `n`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize `k` (number of groups) and `total_students` (sum of students counted so far).
3. **Loop**: Iterate, incrementing `k` each time and adding `k` to `total_students`.
4. **Condition Check**: When `total_students` exceeds `n`, it implies we can't form the next larger group, thus we return `k - 1`.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Not needed for this approach; we do not need to sort the array.
- **Iteration**: The while loop iterates until the sum exceeds `n`, essentially finding the maximum `k` such that `k*(k+1)/2 <= n`. This operates in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) time.

Thus the overall time complexity is **O(âˆšn)**, which is efficient and ensures the solution scales well with larger inputs.
