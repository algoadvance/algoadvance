[Leetcode 3185. Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3185)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `hours`, representing the hours worked by employees in a day. A `complete day` is defined as an 8-hour workday. You need to find the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that the sum of `hours[i]` and `hours[j]` equals 8, where `i < j`.

Write a function:

```javascript
function countPairs(hours) {
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the hours worked by each employee always between 0 and 8?**
   - Yes, the hours array contains integers where 0 <= hours[i] <= 8.

2. **Can there be negative values in the hours array?**
   - No, per the problem description, hours worked are between 0 and 8.

3. **Can the array have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate values.

4. **What should be the output if no such pairs exist?**
   - The function should return 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a hash map to keep track of the count of each number encountered so far. For each number in the array, we will compute its complement that, along with the current number, sums up to 8. We can then look up how many times this complement has been encountered before in the hash map. This approach ensures that we only consider pairs where `i < j`.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize an empty hash map/object.
2. Initialize the `count` variable, which will store the number of valid pairs.
3. Iterate through the `hours` array:
   - Calculate the complement of the current element such that `current_element + complement = 8`.
   - Check if this complement exists in the hash map:
     - If it does, add the count of this complement to the `count`.
   - Add/increment the count of the current element in the hash map.
4. Return the `count` after processing all elements.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `hours` array. This is because we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the hash map that stores the counts of elements.

### Code

```javascript
function countPairs(hours) {
    const hourMap = {};
    let count = 0;

    for (const hour of hours) {
        const complement = 8 - hour;
        if (hourMap[complement] !== undefined) {
            count += hourMap[complement];
        }
        
        if (hourMap[hour] === undefined) {
            hourMap[hour] = 0;
        }
        hourMap[hour]++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Explanation

- We initialize an empty hash map `hourMap` to keep track of how many times each hour has been encountered.
- For each hour in the `hours` array:
  - We calculate the complement that needs to be added to the current hour to sum up to 8.
  - If the complement is found in the hash map, it means one or more valid pairs can be formed. We add the count of these complements to our total pair count.
  - We then update the hash map by incrementing the count of the current hour.
- Finally, we return the count of all valid pairs that sum up to 8.

This solution ensures that the pairs are counted only once and adheres to the condition where `i < j`.
