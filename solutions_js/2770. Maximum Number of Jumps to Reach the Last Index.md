[Leetcode 2770. Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2770)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`.

You are initially positioned at index `0`. In one move, you can jump `i` indices forward where `1 <= i < n` and `nums[index] + target >= nums[index + i]`.

Return the maximum number of jumps you can make to reach the last index, or `-1` if it's not possible to reach the last index.

### Example
```
Input: 
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4], target = 5
Output: 2

Input:
nums = [2, 7, 9, 4, 4], target = 5
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the `nums` array is non-empty and always has at least one element?
2. What should we return if the array has only one element or if `n-1` is already less than the length of the `nums` array?
3. What are the expected time and space complexity? Are there any constraints on the size of the input?

## Strategy

Let's utilize **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve this problem. The general idea is to maintain a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of jumps required to reach index `i`.

1. Initialize a DP array `dp` with size `n` and fill it with a very large number (let's use `Infinity`), except for the first element, which should be `0` because no jumps are needed to stay at the initial position.
2. Iterate through the array and for each element, try to update the DP array.
3. For each `i` from `0 to n-1`, if `dp[i] < Infinity`, update `dp[j]` (where `j` is reachable from `i` based on the target condition). Update dp as: `dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)`.
4. Finally, return `dp[n-1]` if it's not `Infinity`; otherwise, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
function maxJumps(nums, target) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dp[i] !== Infinity) {
            for (let j = i + 1; j < n && nums[i] + target >= nums[j]; j++) {
                dp[j] = Math.min(dp[j], dp[i] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n-1] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[n-1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - In the worst case, each element checks each other element to see if it can be reached from it.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - We are using an extra DP array of size `n`.

While this time complexity isn't optimal and could be improved, it'll work well for reasonably sized input arrays. For much larger inputs, more efficient algorithms or optimizations might be necessary.
