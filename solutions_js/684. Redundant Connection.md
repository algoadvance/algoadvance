[Leetcode 684. Redundant Connection](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l684)
## Problem Statement

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles. You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return an edge that, when removed, will result in a tree with `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the edge that occurs last in the input.

### Example 1:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on input constraints:**
   - Can the input array `edges` be empty or null?
   - Should we assume the edge values are always valid integers?
   - Is there guaranteed to be exactly one redundant edge?

2. **Output specifics:**
   - If multiple redundant edges cause a cycle, should we return the last edge in the input list as the solution?

## Strategy

To solve this problem we can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently manage dynamic connectivity. The strategy involves:

1. Initializing a Union-Find structure to manage the node connections.
2. Iterating through each edge in the `edges` array and applying the `union` operation.
3. During the union operation, if we find that two nodes are already in the same set, it means this edge forms a cycle, hence it is the redundant connection.
4. Returning the last edge that forms a cycle.

## Code Implementation

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the outlined strategy:

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, index) => index);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(0);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        const rootX = this.find(x);
        const rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX === rootY) {
            return false;
        }

        if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
            this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
            this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
        } else {
            this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            this.rank[rootX] += 1;
        }

        return true;
    }
}

var findRedundantConnection = function(edges) {
    const n = edges.length;
    const uf = new UnionFind(n + 1); // +1 because nodes are 1-indexed

    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        if (!uf.union(u, v)) {
            return [u, v];
        }
    }

    return [];
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findRedundantConnection([[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]])); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(findRedundantConnection([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 4], [1, 5]])); // Output: [1, 4]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Initialization:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Union/Find Operations:** Amortized `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the Inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly and is practically constant for reasonable values of `n`.
- **Overall Complexity:** Since we are performing the union/find operation for each edge, the overall time complexity is `O(n * α(n))`, which is nearly linear.

This guarantees efficient handling of the dynamic connectivity checks necessary to solve the problem.
