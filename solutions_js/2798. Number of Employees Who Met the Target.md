[Leetcode 2798. Number of Employees Who Met the Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2798)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers representing the performance of employees in a company, and an integer target representing the performance target that needs to be achieved. Your task is to count the number of employees whose performance meets or exceeds the target.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values can the performance list include?
   - Whatâ€™s the size limit of the performance list?
   - Is the target always a non-negative integer?

2. **Output:**
   - Do we simply return the count of employees meeting the target?

Assuming the list of performances and target are valid integers, we should proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Counter:** Start with a counter at 0.
2. **Loop Through Performance List:** Iterate through each performance in the list.
3. **Check Performance Against Target:** For each performance, check if it meets or exceeds the target.
4. **Increment Counter:** If it does, increment the counter.
5. **Return Counter:** At the end of the loop, return the counter.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(performanceList, target) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let performance of performanceList) {
        if (performance >= target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let performanceList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let target = 30;
console.log(numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(performanceList, target)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `performanceList`.
  - We are iterating through the list once, performing a constant-time comparison for each element.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are using a finite amount of extra space (for the counter), regardless of the size of the input list.

This approach efficiently counts the number of employees meeting or exceeding the target performance.
