[Leetcode 3216. Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3216)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a set of pairs of indices in the string `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` indicates you can swap the characters at index `a` and index `b` of the string. Return the lexicographically smallest string that `s` can be transformed into after using the swaps any number of times.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: "bacd"
Explanation: Swap s[0] and s[3], s = "bcad"
             Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "bacd"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the indices in pairs always be valid and within range of the string?**
   - Yes, you can assume that all pairs of indices are valid.

2. **Is there an upper limit on the string length or number of pairs?**
   - You should consider typical constraints like `1 <= s.length <= 10^4` and `0 <= pairs.length <= 10^4`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure to identify the connected components of the graph defined by the pairs of indices. Each connected component represents indices that can be freely swapped among each other. 

Steps:
1. **Initialize Union-Find Structure**: For union-find, we need arrays to store parent pointers and ranks.
2. **Union by Pairs**: For each pair, perform union operations to group indices into connected components.
3. **Group Connected Components**: Once all union operations are complete, gather indices of each component.
4. **Sort Components**: For each connected component, extract the characters from the string, sort them, and then place the sorted characters back into their respective indices in the result string.
5. **Construct the Result**: Using the sorted characters for each component, create the transformed string.

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

var smallestStringWithSwaps = function(s, pairs) {
    let uf = new UnionFind(s.length);

    // Apply union operation for each (a, b) pair
    for (const [a, b] of pairs) {
        uf.union(a, b);
    }

    // Group characters by connected components
    let components = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let root = uf.find(i);
        if (!(root in components)) {
            components[root] = [];
        }
        components[root].push(s[i]);
    }

    // Sort the characters within each component
    for (let key in components) {
        components[key].sort();
    }

    // Construct the smallest lexicographical string
    let result = Array(s.length);
    let indexMap = {};

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let root = uf.find(i);
        if (!(root in indexMap)) {
            indexMap[root] = 0;
        }
        result[i] = components[root][indexMap[root]];
        indexMap[root]++;
    }

    return result.join('');
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations**: Union and find operations are nearly constant time, given they are very efficient with path compression and rank. Practically, they are `O(α(N))`, where `α` is the Inverse Ackermann function, a very slowly growing function.
- **Grouping and Sorting**: Sorting characters within each component takes `O(N log N)` in the worst case.
- **Overall complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(N log N)` mainly due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures we efficiently and correctly generate the lexicographically smallest string by leveraging the union-find data structure for connected components identification.
