[Leetcode 1744. Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy on Your Favorite Day?](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1744)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer array `candiesCount` where `candiesCount[i]` denotes the number of candies of the `i-th` type you have. You are also given a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [favoriteType_i, favoriteDay_i, dailyCap_i]`.

You need to determine if you can eat the candy of your favorite type on your favorite day. The result for each query should be a boolean value (true or false) indicating if it is possible to achieve this.

Specifically, a query `queries[i]` evaluates to true if you can eat at least one candy of type `favoriteType_i` on day `favoriteDay_i` given that:
1. You start eating candies on day 0.
2. You can eat at most `dailyCap_i` candies per day.

Return an array of boolean answers corresponding to each query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for `candiesCount` and `queries`?**
   - `candiesCount` array length can be up to 100,000.
   - `queries` array length can be up to 100,000.
   - Each value in `candiesCount` can be up to \(10^9\).
   - Each value in `queries` for `favoriteDay_i` can be up to \(10^9\) and `dailyCap_i` can be up to \(10^9\).

2. **Should the days be indexed from 0?**
   - Yes, the days are 0-indexed.

### Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Compute the prefix sum of the `candiesCount` array. This will help in determining the total candies available up to a certain type of candy.
   
2. **Determine Feasibility for Each Query**:
   - You need to ensure two conditions:
     1. You need to have enough time to start eating some candy of type `favoriteType` on `favoriteDay`. This means that the total candies you can eat before the `favoriteType`-th candy should be less than or equal to `favoriteDay * dailyCap`.
     2. There should be enough candies of type `favoriteType` available on `favoriteDay`. This means the maximum number of candies you can eat until `favoriteDay` should be at least `favoriteDay + 1` (because you need to eat at least one candy on that day).

3. **Check Validity of Each Query**:
   - Use the prefix sums to quickly determine the number of candies available before a certain type.
   - Compute the maximum and minimum number of candies you can eat by `favoriteDay` and check if the conditions hold.

### Code

```javascript
var canEatCandiesOnFavoriteDay = function(candiesCount, queries) {
    const n = candiesCount.length;
    const prefixSums = new Array(n).fill(0);
    prefixSums[0] = candiesCount[0];
    
    // Calculate prefix sums
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i - 1] + candiesCount[i];
    }
    
    const result = [];
    for (const [favoriteType, favoriteDay, dailyCap] of queries) {
        const x1 = favoriteDay + 1;
        const y1 = (favoriteDay + 1) * dailyCap;
        
        const x2 = favoriteType === 0 ? 1 : prefixSums[favoriteType - 1] + 1;
        const y2 = prefixSums[favoriteType];
        
        // Check if there's an overlap in the range [x1, y1] and [x2, y2]
        // If x1 <= y2 and y1 >= x2, ranges overlap
        result.push(!(x1 > y2 || y1 < x2));
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example usage
const candiesCount = [7, 4, 5, 3, 8];
const queries = [
    [0, 2, 2],
    [4, 2, 4],
    [2, 13, 1000000000]
];

console.log(canEatCandiesOnFavoriteDay(candiesCount, queries));
// Expected output: [true, false, true]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `candiesCount`.
- **Evaluating Each Query**: \(O(1)\), but since this is done for each query, it is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of queries.

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\), which should be efficient given the problem constraints.
