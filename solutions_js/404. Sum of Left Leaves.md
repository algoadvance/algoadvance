[Leetcode 404. Sum of Left Leaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l404)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves. A leaf is defined as a node with no children, and a left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of its parent.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the `TreeNode` structure?**
   * The tree node is typically defined as:
     ```javascript
     function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
     }
     ```

2. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
   * If the tree is empty, we should return 0.

3. **Does the tree contain negative, zero, or only positive integer values in the nodes?**
   * The problem statement does not restrict the values contained in the nodes, so they can be any integer (negative, zero, or positive).

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree, check for left leaves, and sum their values. We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.

We'll create a helper function to perform the DFS traversal. For each node, if it has a left child that is a leaf, we'll add its value to our sum. If it’s not a leaf, we’ll recursively traverse its left and right children.

## Code
```javascript
function sumOfLeftLeaves(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    let sum = 0;

    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return;

        if (node.left && !node.left.left && !node.left.right) {
            sum += node.left.val;
        }

        dfs(node.left);
        dfs(node.right);
    }

    dfs(root);

    return sum;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to visit each node exactly once to determine if it has a left leaf and to calculate the sum.

## Example
```javascript
// Example Tree
//     3
//    / \
//   9  20
//      / \
//     15  7

const root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(9);
root.right = new TreeNode(20, new TreeNode(15), new TreeNode(7));

console.log(sumOfLeftLeaves(root)); // Output: 24 since 9 and 15 are left leaves.
```

By applying the strategy and the implementation above, all left leaves are correctly identified and their values summed up accordingly.
