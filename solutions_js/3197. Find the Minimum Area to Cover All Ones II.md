[Leetcode 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3197)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary grid filled with 1's (representing land) and 0's (representing water). You need to find the minimum area of a rectangle that contains all the '1's. The sides of the rectangle should be parallel to the rows and columns of the grid.

Write a function `minArea(grid)` that takes the grid as input and returns the area of the smallest rectangle that covers all the '1's present in the matrix.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum dimensions for `m` and `n`?
   - Can the grid be empty?
   - Is it guaranteed to have at least one '1' in the grid?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should we return the area as an integer?

### Assuming Constraints
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^3`
- The grid contains at least one '1'.
- The house is supposed to be rectangular in shape and you need to find the smallest such rectangle that can encompass all the houses shown as '1's.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Boundaries:**
   - We need to find the leftmost and rightmost columns that have any '1' (minimum X and maximum X).
   - We need to find the topmost and bottommost rows that have any '1' (minimum Y and maximum Y).

2. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Once we have these boundaries, the smallest rectangle containing all '1's will be `(maxX - minX + 1) * (maxY - minY + 1)`.

## Code

```javascript
function minArea(grid) {
    let minX = Infinity, maxX = -Infinity;
    let minY = Infinity, maxY = -Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
                minX = Math.min(minX, i);
                maxX = Math.max(maxX, i);
                minY = Math.min(minY, j);
                maxY = Math.max(maxY, j);
            }
        }
    }

    return (maxX - minX + 1) * (maxY - minY + 1);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are scanning each element in the grid exactly once to determine the boundary values.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently identifies the boundaries and computes the required area.
