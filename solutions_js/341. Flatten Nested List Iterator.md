[Leetcode 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l341)
### Problem Statement

You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:
- `NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList)` Initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
- `int next()` Returns the next integer in the nested list.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and `false` otherwise.

### Example:

```javascript
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]

Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the structure of the nested list?**
   - The nested list can contain integers and lists. Each list can further contain integers or other lists.
   
2. **What is the maximum depth of nesting?**
   - There is no explicit limit on the depth, so the solution should handle deep nesting gracefully.

3. **Will there be any invalid input, for example, a null or undefined list?**
   - For simplicity, we can assume that the input is always a valid nested list as described.

### Strategy
1. **Flattening the List:**
   - Use a stack to handle the nested structure. Initialize the stack with the nested list in reverse order to facilitate a depth-first iteration.
   - Use a helper function to flatten the structure as we encounter elements.

2. **Iterator Implementation:**
   - `hasNext()` will check if there are any items left in the stack.
   - `next()` will return the next integer. If the top of the stack is a list, it will flatten it dynamically until the top is an integer.

### Code

```javascript
class NestedIterator {
    constructor(nestedList) {
        this.stack = [];

        // Initialize the stack with the nestedList in reverse order
        for (let i = nestedList.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            this.stack.push(nestedList[i]);
        }
    }

    /**
     * @this NestedIterator
     * @returns {boolean}
     */
    hasNext() {
        while (this.stack.length !== 0) {
            const top = this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
            if (top.isInteger()) {
                return true;
            } else {
                this.stack.pop();
                const list = top.getList();
                for (let i = list.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                    this.stack.push(list[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * @this NestedIterator
     * @returns {integer}
     */
    next() {
        this.hasNext();
        return this.stack.pop().getInteger();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`constructor`)**: O(N) where N is the total number of elements including the deepest nested ones.
- **`next` and `hasNext` Methods**: Each element (integer or list) is processed once and pushed and popped from the stack which makes the average time complexity O(1) per element.

### Space Complexity
- **O(N)**: The stack stores all elements in the worst case, where N is the total number of elements including deeply nested ones.
