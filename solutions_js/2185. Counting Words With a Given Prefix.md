[Leetcode 2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2185)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` and a string `prefix`, return the number of strings in `words` that contain `prefix` as a prefix.

A prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Constraints:**
- \( 1 \leq words.length \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq words[i].length, \prefix.length \leq 100 \)
- words[i] and prefix consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the prefix always a contiguous sequence of characters from the start of the string?**
   - Yes, a prefix is always from the beginning of the string.

2. **Can the `words` array contain duplicate strings?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates, and each occurrence should be counted separately if it matches the prefix.

3. **Can the prefix be equal to the entire word?**
   - Yes, if the prefix matches the entire word, it should be considered a valid prefix.

### Strategy

We need to iterate through each string in the `words` array and check if it starts with the given `prefix`. The built-in JavaScript method `startsWith` from the `String` prototype is ideal for this task.

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
3. For each word, check if it starts with the given `prefix` using the `startsWith` method.
4. If a word starts with the prefix, increment the counter by 1.
5. Return the counter value after the loop ends.

### Code

```javascript
function countWordsWithPrefix(words, prefix) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let word of words) {
        if (word.startsWith(prefix)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let words = ["apple", "app", "application", "banana", "appetite"];
let prefix = "app";
console.log(countWordsWithPrefix(words, prefix));  // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \cdot m)\), where:
- \(n\) is the number of words in the `words` array.
- \(m\) is the maximum length of a word in the `words` array.

In the worst case, for each word, we might need to check up to \(m\) characters to determine if it starts with the prefix, giving us the \(O(n \cdot m)\) complexity.
