[Leetcode 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1109)
### Problem Statement
There are `n` flights, and you have an array of flight bookings `bookings`, where `bookings[i] = [first_i, last_i, seats_i]` represents a booking for flights `first_i` through `last_i` (inclusive) with `seats_i` seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the total number of seats reserved for flight `i`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Boundaries**: Can the `first_i` and `last_i` values in `bookings` be equal? 
   - Yes, this means only one flight is being booked.
2. **Multiple Bookings**: If there are multiple bookings overlapping the same flight, do we sum the seat reservations? 
   - Yes, we should sum all the reservations for each flight.
3. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of flights `n` and the length of `bookings`?
   - Yes, the constraints are generally: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4` and `1 <= len(bookings) <= 2 * 10^4`.

### Strategy
We'll use a difference array approach to efficiently handle seat increments and avoid nested loops which would be inefficient for the given constraints.

1. **Initialize a difference array**: We'll create a `diff` array of size `n+1` initialized to zero.
2. For each booking `[first_i, last_i, seats_i]`:
   - Increment `diff[first_i-1]` by `seats_i`.
   - Decrement `diff[last_i]` by `seats_i`.
3. Convert the `diff` array to the `answer` array by calculating the prefix sum.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} bookings
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var corpFlightBookings = function(bookings, n) {
    // Step 1: Initialize diff array
    const diff = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Step 2: Apply the difference array operations
    for (const [first, last, seats] of bookings) {
        diff[first - 1] += seats;
        if (last < n) {
            diff[last] -= seats;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Generate the answer array by calculating the prefix sum
    const answer = new Array(n);
    answer[0] = diff[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        answer[i] = answer[i - 1] + diff[i];
    }

    return answer;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of flights and `m` is the number of bookings. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
1. **Difference array initialization**: `O(n)`
2. **Processing each booking**: `O(m)`
3. **Generating answer using prefix sum**: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall efficient solution handles large constraints effectively.
