[Leetcode 1630. Arithmetic Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1630)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `nums` and two arrays of `queries` where `queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]`. For each query, compute whether the subarray from `nums[l_i]` to `nums[r_i]` (inclusive) can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers with the difference between consecutive elements being constant.

Return a list of boolean values where each boolean value corresponds to whether the subarray for that query can form an arithmetic sequence.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [4,6,5,9,3,7], queries = [[0,2],[0,3],[2,5],[0,5]]
Output: [true,false,true,false]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` can be any integer values, both positive and negative.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and `queries`?**
   - The length of `nums`'s array and each of the queries' arrays will be within `1 <= nums.length <= 500` and `1 <= queries.length <= 500`, respectively.

3. **Are there any constraints on the elements of the queries?**
   - Each subarray specified by `queries` will be within the bounds of `nums`.

4. **Is the order of the boolean values in the output important?**
   - Yes, the output list should maintain the same order as the input queries.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the `queries` array**: For each query, extract the subarray from `nums`.
2. **Sort the subarray**: Sorting helps to easily identify whether the subarray can be rearranged into an arithmetic sequence.
3. **Check for arithmetic sequence**: Calculate the common difference and verify if subsequent differences match this common difference.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
var checkArithmeticSubarrays = function(nums, queries) {
    let results = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
        let [l, r] = queries[i];
        let subarray = nums.slice(l, r + 1);

        subarray.sort((a, b) => a - b);

        if (subarray.length <= 1) {
            results.push(true);
            continue;
        }

        let diff = subarray[1] - subarray[0];
        let isArithmetic = true;

        for (let j = 1; j < subarray.length - 1; j++) {
            if (subarray[j + 1] - subarray[j] !== diff) {
                isArithmetic = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        results.push(isArithmetic);
    }

    return results;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(checkArithmeticSubarrays([4,6,5,9,3,7], [[0,2],[0,3],[2,5],[0,5]])); // Output: [true,false,true,false]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Extracting the subarray**: This takes O(n) where n is the length of the subarray.
2. **Sorting the subarray**: Sorting takes O(n log n).
3. **Checking for arithmetic sequence**: This takes O(n).

For each query, the operations are O(n log n). Given that there are `m` queries, the overall time complexity is:
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(m * n log n) where `m` is the number of queries and `n` is the average length of each subarray.

This approach ensures efficient handling within the problem constraints.
