[Leetcode 1363. Largest Multiple of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1363)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of digits, you need to find the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some or all of the given digits in any order. If there is no such number, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Clarification**: 
   - Will the input array always contain non-negative single-digit integers (0-9)?
   - Can the input array be empty?
   
2. **Output Clarification**:
   - Should the returned number omit any leading zeros (e.g., [0, 0] should return "0")?
   - If no valid multiple of three can be formed, should the return value be an empty string?

### Code

```javascript
function largestMultipleOfThree(digits) {
    // Count the frequency of each digit
    const count = new Array(10).fill(0);
    let sum = 0;

    for (const digit of digits) {
        count[digit]++;
        sum += digit;
    }

    // Function to remove a specific number of digits starting from the smallest
    const removeDigits = (count, remainder, quantity) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            while (count[i] > 0 && remainder === i % 3 && quantity > 0) {
                count[i]--;
                quantity--;
            }
            if (quantity === 0) break;
        }
        return quantity === 0;
    };

    // Adjust the count array to make the sum a multiple of 3
    if (sum % 3 === 1) {
        if (!removeDigits(count, 1, 1)) {
            removeDigits(count, 2, 2);
        }
    } else if (sum % 3 === 2) {
        if (!removeDigits(count, 2, 1)) {
            removeDigits(count, 1, 2);
        }
    }

    // Generate the largest number by concatenating digits from largest to smallest
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
        result += i.toString().repeat(count[i]);
    }

    // Handle the case where the result is empty or just zeros
    if (result.length === 0 || result[0] === '0') {
        return '0';
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Digit Frequency Count**:
   - Count the frequency of each digit in the input array and calculate the sum of all digits. The sum helps determine if the digits can form a multiple of three.

2. **Remainder Adjustment**:
   - Use the remainder when the sum is divided by 3 to decide which digits to remove to make the sum a multiple of three:
     - If the sum % 3 is 1, try to remove digits giving a remainder of 1. If not enough, remove two digits giving a remainder of 2 each.
     - If the sum % 3 is 2, try to remove digits giving a remainder of 2. If not enough, remove two digits giving a remainder of 1 each.

3. **Forming the Result**:
   - After adjustments, form the largest possible number by concatenating digits from the largest to the smallest.

4. **Leading Zeros Handling**:
   - If the resultant string is empty or consists of zeros, return "0".

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequency and Sum**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.
- **Adjustment Loop**: O(1), as it operates on a fixed range of digits.
- **Forming Result**: O(1), as it loops over a fixed number (10) of possible digit frequencies.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
