[Leetcode 2063. Vowels of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2063)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `word`, return the **number of vowels** (a, e, i, o, u) in every substring of `word`.

A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the input string? (To understand if performance optimization is needed)
    
    The length of the string will be between 1 and \(10^5\).
    
2. **Character Constraints**:
    - Will the input string contain only lowercase English letters?
    
    Yes, it will contain only lowercase English letters.

3. **Output**:
    - Should the output be a single integer (sum of all vowels in all substrings)?
    
    Yes, the output should be a single integer representing the total number of vowels in every substring.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to take advantage of patterns rather than iterating over all possible substrings, which would be computationally expensive.

For each character in the string:
- Count the number of substrings it is part of.
- Check if it is a vowel.
- If it is, compute its contribution to the total count of vowels in all possible substrings it is part of.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. For each character at position `i` in the string of length `n`:
    - The character can act as the starting point for substrings, and it can extend to the end of the string. There are `(n - i)` such substrings.
    - The character can be the ending point of substrings starting from any position till `i`. There are `(i + 1)` such substrings.
    - Therefore, the character `word[i]` will be part of `(i + 1) * (n - i)` substrings in total.
    - If `word[i]` is a vowel, its contribution to the total vowel count will be `(i + 1) * (n - i)`.

2. Sum these contributions for all characters in the string.

### Code

```javascript
const countVowels = (word) => {
    const vowels = new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']);
    const n = word.length;
    let totalVowels = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (vowels.has(word[i])) {
            totalVowels += (i + 1) * (n - i);
        }
    }

    return totalVowels;
};

// Example usage:
const word = "abc";
console.log(countVowels(word));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution iterates through the string once and performs constant-time operations for each character, making the time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity**: We are using a set of vowels which is of fixed size (5 elements), and a few integer variables, resulting in \(O(1)\) additional space usage. 

This approach ensures efficiency even for the upper constraint of the input size.
