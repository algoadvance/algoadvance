[Leetcode 556. Next Greater Element III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l556)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer `n` and is greater in value than `n`. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - Typically, `n` will fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. **Output Type**: Should the output always be an integer?
   - Yes, return `-1` if no greater permutation exists, otherwise return the next greater permutation as an integer.

### Strategy
1. **Check for Edge Cases**: Verify if `n` consists of all the same digits (e.g., 111), or is in descending order (e.g., 5432). In these cases, return `-1`.
2. **Finding the Pivot**:
   - Traverse the number from right to left to find the first digit that is smaller than the digit next to it.
3. **Finding the Swap Element**:
   - From right to left again, find the smallest digit that is greater than the identified pivot digit.
4. **Swapping Elements**: Swap these two digits.
5. **Reversing the Suffix**: Reverse the digits to the right of the originally identified pivot to get the smallest possible number greater than `n`.

### Code
```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(n) {
    let arr = n.toString().split('');
    let len = arr.length;

    // Step 1: Find the first decreasing element from the right
    let i = len - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]) {
        i--;
    }
    
    // No next permutation if no decreasing element is found
    if (i < 0) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find the element that is just greater than arr[i] from the right
    let j = len - 1;
    while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) {
        j--;
    }

    // Step 3: Swap elements at i and j
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
    
    // Step 4: Reverse the elements to the right of i
    let rightPart = arr.splice(i + 1).reverse();
    arr = arr.concat(rightPart);

    // Convert the array back to number
    let result = parseInt(arr.join(''), 10);
    
    // Check if the result is within 32-bit integer range
    return result <= 0x7FFFFFFF ? result : -1;
}

// Example usage:
// The number 534976 should return 536479
console.log(nextGreaterElement(534976));  // Output: 536479
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is **O(d)** where `d` is the number of digits in the integer `n`.

- **Finding the Pivot**: O(d) as we traverse the digits from right to left.
- **Finding the Swap Element**: O(d) for another right-to-left traversal.
- **Swapping & Reversing**: O(d/2) for swapping and O(d/2) for reversing, both contributing O(d).

Hence, the total complexity is linear with respect to the digits in `n`.
