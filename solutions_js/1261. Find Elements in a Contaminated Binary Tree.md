[Leetcode 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1261)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary tree with a root that was originally a binary tree of integers. However, some of the integer values were changed to -1, which contaminated the tree. You need to implement a `FindElements` class:

1. `FindElements(TreeNode root)` - Initializes the `FindElements` object with a contaminated binary tree and recovers it by assigning new values to the nodes in such a way that:
   - The root node is assigned the value `0`.
   - For any node assigned the value `x`, its left child is assigned the value `2 * x + 1` and its right child is assigned the value `2 * x + 2`.
   
2. `bool find(int target)` - Returns `true` if the target value exists in the recovered tree, otherwise returns `false`.

### Strategy
1. **Recover the tree**: We will traverse the tree, starting from the root, and assign values to each node based on the described rules.
2. **Store values**: We will maintain a set of the values assigned to the tree nodes for easy and efficient `find` operations.
3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse and recover the tree.
   - Store the recovered values in a set.
   - Implement the `find` method to simply check for the presence of the target value in the set.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the `find` method be called multiple times?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree or the values?

Let's assume generic conditions unless specified otherwise.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
}

var FindElements = function(root) {
    this.values = new Set();
    this.recoverTree(root, 0); // start recovering from root with value 0
};

FindElements.prototype.recoverTree = function(node, value) {
    if (!node) return;
    
    node.val = value;
    this.values.add(value);
    
    if (node.left) {
        this.recoverTree(node.left, 2 * value + 1);
    }
    if (node.right) {
        this.recoverTree(node.right, 2 * value + 2);
    }
};

FindElements.prototype.find = function(target) {
    return this.values.has(target);
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization (Recovering the Tree)**:
   - Time complexity: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We are visiting each node exactly once.
   - Space complexity: O(n) for storing the recovered values in the set.

2. **Find Operation**:
   - Time complexity: O(1) for looking up a value in the set.
   - Space complexity: O(1) for the set lookup.

By storing values in the set, the `find` method operation is highly efficient, ensuring optimal performance for multiple queries.
