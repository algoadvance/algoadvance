[Leetcode 1531. String Compression II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1531)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to delete `k` characters from the string so that the run-length encoded version of the string has the smallest possible length. The encoding is done such that any contiguous repeated substring of characters is represented as the character followed by the number of repetitions. For instance, the string `aaabbbccc` can be encoded into `a3b3c3`.

Return the length of the smallest run-length encoded version of the string after deleting `k` characters.

### Example:
- **Input:** `s = "aaabcccd", k = 2`
- **Output:** `4`
  
  Explanation: Delete `ab` to make the string `aacccd`, which is encoded to `a2c3d`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of the string `s` and the value of `k`?
   **A:** The length of `s` is between 1 and 100 and `k` is between 0 and `len(s)`.

2. **Q:** Are all characters in `s` lowercase English letters?
   **A:** Yes.

3. **Q:** Is it allowed to remove characters that form different contiguous substrings or should the removal be contiguous?
   **A:** Characters can be removed from any position, they do not need to be contiguous.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a memoization table to store the results of sub-problems so that they are not recomputed.
   - The state of the DP is represented by the position in the string and the number of remaining deletions.
   - Transition between states involves either deleting a character or keeping it and merging adjacent segments.
   - The primary function will recursively calculate the minimum encoded length for a given state.

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - A function to compute run-length encoding of a given string segment.
   - A helper function to manage the DP table and initiate recursive calls.

## Code

```javascript
function getLengthOfOptimalCompression(s, k) {
    const n = s.length;
    const memo = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(k + 1).fill(-1));

    const dp = (start, kLeft) => {
        if (kLeft < 0) return Infinity;
        if (start >= n || n - start <= kLeft) return 0;
        if (memo[start][kLeft] !== -1) return memo[start][kLeft];

        let result = Infinity;
        let count = Array(26).fill(0);
        let maxCount = 0;

        for (let j = start; j < n; ++j) {
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++count[s[j].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]);
            result = Math.min(result, 1 + getLen(maxCount) + dp(j + 1, kLeft - (j - start + 1 - maxCount)));
        }

        memo[start][kLeft] = result;
        return result;
    };

    const getLen = (x) => {
        if (x === 1) return 0;
        if (x < 10) return 1;
        if (x < 100) return 2;
        return 3;
    };

    return dp(0, k);
}

// Example usage:
let s = "aaabcccd", k = 2;
console.log(getLengthOfOptimalCompression(s, k)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n * k * n), where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of deletions allowed. This results from iterating over the string and each recursive step evaluating potential deletions.
