[Leetcode 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1161)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the smallest level `X` such that the sum of all nodes at level `X` is maximal. The binary tree is represented as follows:

- Each tree node has an integer value.
- Levels of the tree start at 1 (the root node is on level 1).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if there are multiple levels with the same maximum sum?**
   - Return the smallest level `X`.
2. **Can the node values be negative?**
   - Yes, node values can be negative.

### Strategy
1. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**: Traverse the binary tree level by level and maintain the sum of node values at each level.
2. Use a queue to facilitate the level order traversal.
3. Keep track of the level sums in a dictionary where the key is the level number and the value is the sum of that level.
4. Determine the level with the maximum sum and return it.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxLevelSum = function(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    let queue = [root];
    let currentLevel = 1;
    let maxSum = -Infinity;
    let maxLevel = 0;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSum = 0;
        const levelLength = queue.length;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelLength; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift();
            levelSum += node.val;

            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }

        if (levelSum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = levelSum;
            maxLevel = currentLevel;
        }

        currentLevel++;
    }

    return maxLevel;
};
```

### Detailed Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
    - Check if the root is null. If it is, return 0.
    - Initialize a queue with the root node to facilitate the level order traversal.
    - Initialize variables to keep track of the current level (`currentLevel`), maximum sum (`maxSum`), and the level with the maximum sum (`maxLevel`).

2. **Level Order Traversal**:
    - Use a while loop to process nodes level by level.
    - Within the loop, iterate over the nodes at the current level using a for loop.
    - Calculate the sum of the current level by iterating through all nodes in the queue for that level.
    - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue if they exist.

3. **Updating Maximum Level and Sum**:
    - After computing the sum for the current level, check if it is greater than the currently recorded maximum sum.
    - If it is, update the `maxSum` and record the `currentLevel` as `maxLevel`.

4. **Increment the Level**:
    - Increment the `currentLevel` after processing all nodes at the current level.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(N)** where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is processed exactly once in the level order traversal.
- The space complexity is **O(M)** where `M` is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree (maximum width of the binary tree).
