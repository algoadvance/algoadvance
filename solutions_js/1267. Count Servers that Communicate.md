[Leetcode 1267. Count Servers that Communicate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1267)
### Problem Statement

You are given a matrix `m` x `n` representing the servers that are located in a data center. If `grid[i][j] = 1`, it means that there is a server at location `(i, j)`. If `grid[i][j] = 0`, it means that there is no server at location `(i, j)`.

Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with at least one other server.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the matrix `m` x `n`?**
   - The matrix can have both `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns) in the range of 1 to 250.

2. **What are the possible values of the matrix elements?**
   - The matrix elements will be either `0` or `1`.

3. **Is there any constraint on server communication?**
   - Yes, a server must communicate with at least one other server in either the same row or column.

### Strategy

1. **Count Row and Column Servers:**
   - Traverse the grid to count the number of servers in each row and column.

2. **Identify Communicating Servers:**
   - Traverse the grid again and count the servers that have at least one other server in the same row or column.

3. **Return the Final Count of Communicating Servers.**

### Code

```javascript
function countServers(grid) {
    let rows = grid.length;
    let cols = grid[0].length;
    
    let rowServerCount = Array(rows).fill(0);
    let colServerCount = Array(cols).fill(0);
    
    // First pass: count servers in each row and column
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                rowServerCount[i]++;
                colServerCount[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    let communicatingServers = 0;
    
    // Second pass: identify servers that can communicate
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                if (rowServerCount[i] > 1 || colServerCount[j] > 1) {
                    communicatingServers++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return communicatingServers;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **First Loop:** O(m * n) to count the number of servers in each row and column.
  - **Second Loop:** O(m * n) to identify servers that can communicate.
  - **Overall:** O(m * n) which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - O(m + n) for the row and column counts arrays, which is manageable within the input constraints.

This solution should perform efficiently for the maximum input size of 250 x 250.
