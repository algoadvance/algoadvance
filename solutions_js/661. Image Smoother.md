[Leetcode 661. Image Smoother](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l661)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer matrix `M` representing the grayscale of an image, write a function to smooth the image.

The smoothing process requires the average of the pixel values from the 3x3 window centered at each pixel, including the pixel itself. If a cell that you are averaging over is outside the matrix border, it does not count towards the average. (The average calculation should be rounded down to the nearest integer.)

### Example

**Input:**
``` javascript
M = [
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
```
**Output:**
``` javascript
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,0,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

**Explanation:**
- For the cell at (0,0): The 3x3 window includes the cells [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)] with the values [1, 1, 1, 0].
  - Average = floor((1+1+1+0) / 4) = 0
- Repeat the process for each cell.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Matrix Dimensions:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the matrix M?
   - **Assumption:** The matrix dimensions are within reasonable limits for normal computation (e.g., 1 <= rows, cols <= 200).

2. **Range of Values:**
   - What is the range of pixel values in the matrix M?
   - **Assumption:** Pixel values are non-negative integers within a reasonably small range (e.g., 0 <= M[i][j] <= 255).

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Result Matrix:** Create a new matrix of the same dimensions as M to store the resulting values.
2. **Iterate Over Each Cell in the Matrix:**
   - For each cell at position (i, j) in M, consider the 3x3 window centered at (i, j).
   - Compute the sum of all cells within this window that are inside the bounds of M.
   - Calculate the number of valid cells in the window.
3. **Compute Average:** Compute the floor of the average of these cells and store the result in the corresponding cell in the result matrix.
4. **Return the Result Matrix.**

### Code

```javascript
function imageSmoother(M) {
    const rows = M.length;
    const cols = M[0].length;
    const result = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));

    const directions = [
        [0, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0],
        [1, 1], [1, -1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1]
    ];

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            let sum = 0;
            let count = 0;

            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                const x = i + dx;
                const y = j + dy;
                if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols) {
                    sum += M[x][y];
                    count++;
                }
            }

            result[i][j] = Math.floor(sum / count);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n * 9)** where **m** is the number of rows and **n** is the number of columns in the matrix. The constant factor 9 comes from the fixed number of cells (3x3 window) considered for each pixel. Thus, the overall complexity is **O(m * n)**. 

This solution ensures that each cell in the matrix is processed only a fixed number of times, making it efficient for typical input sizes.
