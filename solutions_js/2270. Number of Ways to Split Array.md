[Leetcode 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2270)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` containing `n` integers. A split index `i` is an index such that the sum of the first `i` elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last `n - i` elements.

Return the number of valid split indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the problem does not specify any restrictions on the values of the integers in the array.

2. **What should we return if no such split index exists?**
   - Return 0 if there are no valid split indices.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array?**
   - Yes, typically constraints would be specified but assume "n" can be large based on usual competitive programming constraints (e.g., up to 10^5).

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Total Sum:** First, compute the total sum of the array, denoted as `totalSum`.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** Traverse through the array and keep a running sum of the elements from the start. At each index `i`, calculate the sum of elements from the start to `i` (`leftSum`). The sum of the remaining elements (`rightSum`) can be derived as `totalSum - leftSum`. 
3. **Count Valid Splits:** Check if `leftSum` is greater than or equal to `rightSum`. If it is, count this index as a valid split.
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases with very small arrays separately, though itâ€™s implicitly covered as loops and conditions will naturally account for it.

### Code

```javascript
function waysToSplitArray(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let totalSum = 0;
    nums.forEach(num => totalSum += num);

    let leftSum = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    // Iterate through all potential split points
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        leftSum += nums[i];
        let rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
        
        if (leftSum >= rightSum) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example Usage:
let nums = [10, 4, -8, 7];
console.log(waysToSplitArray(nums)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution involves a single pass to calculate the total sum (`O(n)`) and another pass to compute valid split indices (`O(n)`). Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, leading to `O(1)` space complexity.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently even for large input sizes.
