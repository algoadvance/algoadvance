[Leetcode 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l30)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of **the same length**. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once, in **any order**, and **without any intervening characters**.

You can return the answer in **any order**.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, so [9,0] is also correct.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be overlapping substrings in the result?
2. Are the words in `words` guaranteed to be non-repetitive?
3. Are multiple occurrences of the same word in `words` allowed?

## Strategy
1. **Step 1**: Compute the total length required for the concatenation of all words.
2. **Step 2**: Use a sliding window of this total length and check if each window in the string `s` is a valid concatenation of all words.
3. **Step 3**: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each word in `words`.
4. **Step 4**: For each window, split the substring into words of the required length and compare against the hash map to ensure the counts match.
5. **Step 5**: If they match, record the starting index.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findSubstring = function(s, words) {
    if (!s || words.length === 0) return [];
    
    const wordLength = words[0].length;
    const concatLength = wordLength * words.length;

    if (s.length < concatLength) return [];
    
    const wordCount = new Map();
    for (let word of words) {
        wordCount.set(word, (wordCount.get(word) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const results = [];

    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - concatLength; i++) {
        const seen = new Map();
        let j = 0;
        for (; j < words.length; j++) {
            const wordIndex = i + j * wordLength;
            const word = s.substring(wordIndex, wordIndex + wordLength);

            if (!wordCount.has(word)) {
                break;
            }
            seen.set(word, (seen.get(word) || 0) + 1);

            if (seen.get(word) > wordCount.get(word)) {
                break;
            }
        }
        if (j === words.length) {
            results.push(i);
        }
    }

    return results;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman", ["foo","bar"])); // Output: [0, 9]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * M * L)
  - `N` is the length of the string `s`.
  - `M` is the number of words in the array `words`.
  - `L` is the length of each word.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M)
  - The space complexity is dominated by the hash maps used to count the occurrences of the words.

This approach ensures each pertinent substring is checked in an efficient manner by leveraging hash maps for quick lookups and comparisons.
