[Leetcode 398. Random Pick Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l398)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given `target` number. You can assume that the given target number will always exist in the array.

Implement the `Solution` class:
- `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the array `nums`.
- `int pick(int target)` Picks a random index `i` from `nums` where `nums[i] == target`. Each index should have an equal probability of being returned.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the code, let's clarify some details:
1. What should be the expected behavior if there are multiple indices with the target value? Answer: Each index should have an equal probability of being returned.
2. Can the `pick` method be called multiple times? Answer: Yes, the method can be called multiple times.
3. Is there any constraint on the size of the `nums` array? Answer: The constraints were not provided in the problem statement, but we should assume it could be sizable given the context of the problem.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to ensure that each valid index for the target has an equal probability of being chosen. We'll use the concept known as "Reservoir Sampling" for this purpose.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the array `nums` in an instance variable upon initialization.
  
2. **Pick Method**:
   - Traverse through the array and whenever we encounter the target, we randomly decide whether to select the current index or keep our previous selection.
   - Using Reservoir Sampling, we ensure that each valid index has an equal probability of being chosen.

### Code

```javascript
class Solution {
  /**
   * @param {number[]} nums
   */
  constructor(nums) {
    this.nums = nums;
  }

  /**
   * @param {number} target
   * @return {number}
   */
  pick(target) {
    let count = 0;
    let result = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < this.nums.length; i++) {
      if (this.nums[i] === target) {
        count++;
        // Randomly select an index with probability 1/count
        if (Math.floor(Math.random() * count) === 0) {
          result = i;
        }
      }
    }

    return result;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
console.log(solution.pick(3)); // Random index of value 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`constructor`) Time Complexity**: O(1) — The constructor just stores the array, so it's a constant-time operation.
  
- **Pick (`pick` method) Time Complexity**: O(n) — The method traverses the entire array once to count occurrences of the target and uses reservoir sampling, making it linear in terms of the array size `n`.

This approach ensures that the `pick` method works correctly even for large arrays, and each valid index is picked with equal probability.
