[Leetcode 2865. Beautiful Towers I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2865)
### Problem Statement

You have been given an integer array `heights`. The heights array represents towers, and you are to find the maximum value of the following:

1. The sum of a selected subarray (`sub_heights`) from the heights array.
2. From the subarray to another subarray with all elements decreased by 1.

In other words, you need to find the maximum sum of towers after making all towers in a selected subarray shorter by one unit but not less than zero.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the heights in the array be negative?
   - No, heights are non-negative integers as they represent physical heights.
2. Are we guaranteed that the array has at least one element?
   - Yes, we can assume the input array has at least one element.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Subarrays**: Consider all possible subarrays in the input array `heights`.
2. **Calculate Drops**: For each subarray, calculate how the heights would be after a 1-unit drop.
3. **Sum Over Subarrays**: Compute the sum of the resulting subarray after modification.
4. **Maximize the Sum**: Track the maximum sum encountered.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function maxSumAfterDecrease(heights) {
  let maxSum = 0;
  const n = heights.length;

  // Iterate over all possible subarrays
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
      let currentSum = 0;
      for (let k = i; k <= j; k++) {
        // Subtract 1 from the height if possible
        currentSum += Math.max(0, heights[k] - 1);
      }
      maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Test cases
console.log(maxSumAfterDecrease([1, 2, 3])); // Expected output: 4 (subarray [2, 3] => [1, 2] => 1+2=3, and combined [1,1,2]=4)
console.log(maxSumAfterDecrease([5, 1, 3])); // Expected output: 7 (subarray [5, 1, 3] => [4, 0, 2] => 4+0+2=6 or [5,1]=>[4,0]=4, and combined 4+2=6)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding subarrays**: O(n^2) - We generate all subarrays, the sum of which involves an additional inner loop.
- **Summing values**: O(n) - For each subarray, we calculate the sum of heights decreased by 1.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is **O(n^3)**, which may be suboptimal for very large arrays.

### Note

This brute-force approach works fine for smaller arrays but would need optimization for larger inputs. Possible optimizations could involve using a sliding window or dynamic programming technique to reduce repetitive calculations.
