[Leetcode 2575. Find the Divisibility Array of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2575)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `word` composed of digits (0-9), and a positive integer `m`. You need to return an array of the same length as `word` where each element is 1 if the number formed by `word` from the start to that index (inclusive) is divisible by `m`, and 0 otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Input Constraints:** 
  - Is the string guaranteed to be non-empty?
  - What is the maximum length of the string?
  
- **Expected Output**:
  - Are we allowed to assume the output is always present and valid?
  
### Example
Let's consider an example to clear up the task:

Input: 
```python
word = "1234"
m = 2
```

Output:
```python
[0, 1, 1, 0]
```

- For '1' - Not divisible by 2, hence 0.
- For '12' - Divisible by 2, hence 1.
- For '123' - Divisible by 2, hence 1.
- For '1234' - Not Divisible by 2, hence 0.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize an Empty Array**: Create an array `result` of the same length as `word` with default values as 0.
2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Maintain a variable `current_num` that represents the number from the start to the current index.
   - For each digit in the string, update `current_num` and check if it's divisible by `m`.
   - Based on the check, update the current index in the result array to either 1 or 0.

### Implementation
Let's implement this strategy in JavaScript.

### Code
```javascript
function divisibilityArray(word, m) {
  const result = new Array(word.length).fill(0);
  let current_num = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    // Update current number to include the current digit
    current_num = current_num * 10 + parseInt(word[i]);
    
    // Check divisibility
    if (current_num % m === 0) {
      result[i] = 1;
    } else {
      result[i] = 0;
    }

    // Since we're only interested in the divisibility, we can reduce the size of current_num
    // to avoid large number computation by using modulo m
    current_num %= m;
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
let word = "1234";
let m = 2;
console.log(divisibilityArray(word, m)); // Output: [0, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `word`. This is because we iterate through the string once. 

The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the result array which stores one value per character in the input string.

### Conclusion
We devised a strategy to traverse the `word` string and dynamically check the divisibility of the number formed from the start to the current index by `m`. This was implemented efficiently using a linear pass through the string, keeping track of the current number modulo `m` to prevent overflow for large numbers during computation.
