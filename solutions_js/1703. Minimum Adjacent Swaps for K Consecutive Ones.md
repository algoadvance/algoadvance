[Leetcode 1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1703)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing `0`s and `1`s and an integer `k`, return **the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to group **at least `k`** consecutive `1`s together.**

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of the array `nums`?
2. **Edge Cases**: Can the array `nums` contain all `0`s or all `1`s?
3. **Constraints**: Any additional constraints on the values within `nums`?

If the default constraints from LeetCode apply, let's proceed with this understanding.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the Positions of '1's**: Create an array `positions` to store the indices where the `1`s are located.
2. **Sliding Window to Find Minimum Swaps**:
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` to process `positions`.
   - For each window, calculate the cost of bringing the `k` `1`s together.
   - Track the minimum cost across all windows.

**Calculating the Cost**:
For any segment of size `k`, the cost can be optimized by bringing the `1`s closer to the median position of the segment. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

### Code

```javascript
function minMoves(nums, k) {
    let onesPositions = [];

    // Step 1: Extract the positions of '1's
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            onesPositions.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Calculate prefix sum of positions for efficiency in range sum calculations
    let prefixSum = new Array(onesPositions.length + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < onesPositions.length; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + onesPositions[i];
    }

    // Step 2: Sliding window of size k
    let minSwaps = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i <= onesPositions.length - k; i++) {
        let midIndex = i + Math.floor(k / 2);
        let medianPosition = onesPositions[midIndex];
        
        // Calculate the cost of moving other '1's to the median position
        let cost = (onesPositions[midIndex] * (k % 2 ? 1 : 0)) +
                   ((k - 1) * (Math.floor(k / 2))) - 
                   (prefixSum[i + k] - prefixSum[i]) +
                   (prefixSum[i + Math.floor((k - 1) / 2)] - prefixSum[i]) -
                   (prefixSum[i + k] - prefixSum[i + k - Math.floor((k+1) / 2)]);

        minSwaps = Math.min(minSwaps, cost);
    }

    return minSwaps;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Identifying Positions of '1's**: \( O(n) \)
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \( O(n) \)
- **Sliding Window Calculation**: For each window, we efficiently compute the cost using precomputed prefix sums, leading to \( O(1) \) per subarray. The overall complexity for the sliding window part is \( O(m) \) where `m` is the number of '1's, because each 1's position is processed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:

\[ O(n + m) \]

where `n` is the length of `nums` and `m` is the number of '1's in it.
