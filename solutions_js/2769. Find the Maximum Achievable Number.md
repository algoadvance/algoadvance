[Leetcode 2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2769)
## Problem Statement:
You are given two integers, `num` and `t`. In one operation, you can add or subtract `t` from `num`.

You need to determine the maximum achievable number possible after performing any number of these operations.

### Input:
- `num` (integer): The starting number.
- `t` (integer): The number to add or subtract in each operation.

### Output:
- Return a single integer representing the maximum achievable number.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we perform zero operations?
   - Yes, performing zero operations is allowed.
2. Is there any limit to the number of operations?
   - No, there is no limit to the number of operations.
3. Are `num` and `t` constrained within a particular range?
   - The problem statement does not mention any specific constraints, so we can assume standard integer ranges.

## Strategy:
Since we can perform any number of operations, the problem boils down to determining how far we can maximize the value of `num` by adding `t` multiple times.

For the maximum achievable number:
1. We add `t` as many times as possible to `num`.

Thus, the maximum achievable number will simply be:
\[ \text{max\_achievable\_number} = \text{num} + t \]

Note:
After reviewing the problem condition, it looks like we need to consider both adding and subtracting as possible operations that can be performed. However, we should focus on maximizing the value which is best achieved by adding \( t \) recursively.

## Code:
```javascript
function findMaxAchievableNumber(num, t) {
    return num + t;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findMaxAchievableNumber(3, 5)); // Output: 8
console.log(findMaxAchievableNumber(-2, 7)); // Output: 5
console.log(findMaxAchievableNumber(10, 0)); // Output: 10
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(1) \) – The solution computes the result using a single arithmetic operation.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) – No extra space is used beyond a few variables.

By adding `t` to `num`, we directly find the maximum achievable number with optimal time and space complexity.
