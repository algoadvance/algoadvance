[Leetcode 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1758)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` an alternating binary string.

An alternating binary string is a string where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, `'0101'` and `'1010'` are alternating, but `'0100'` and `'0110'` are not.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum length of the string `s`? (Answer: Typically for LeetCode problems, this can be up to \(10^5\))
   
2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum number of changes? (Answer: Yes)

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What should be the output if the input string `s` is empty? (Answer: The output should be `0` as no changes are needed)

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use two predefined target strings based on the length of `s`:

1. A string that starts with '0' and alternates: For example, for `n = 5`, the alternate string `"01010"`.
2. A string that starts with '1' and alternates: For example, for `n = 5`, the alternate string `"10101"`.

We will compare the input string `s` with each of these target strings, counting the number of differing characters. The minimum number of differences will be our answer.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    let count1 = 0; // Differences with "010101..."
    let count2 = 0; // Differences with "101010..."

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Expected characters for the two patterns
        const char1 = (i % 2 === 0) ? '0' : '1';
        const char2 = (i % 2 === 0) ? '1' : '0';

        if (s[i] !== char1) count1++;
        if (s[i] !== char2) count2++;
    }

    return Math.min(count1, count2);
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we're iterating through the string once and performing constant time operations for each character.

### Explanation

- We initialize two counters `count1` and `count2` to zero. These will count the number of changes needed to convert `s` to each of the two target alternating strings.
- We then iterate through each character of `s`.
    - For even indices, we expect '0' for `count1` and '1' for `count2`.
    - For odd indices, we expect '1' for `count1` and '0' for `count2`.
    - We increase `count1` and `count2` whenever there is a mismatch.
- Finally, we return the minimum of the two counts, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into an alternating binary string.

This solution ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum operations needed with a single pass through the string.
