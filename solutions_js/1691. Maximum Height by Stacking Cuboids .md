[Leetcode 1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1691)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` cuboids where the dimensions of the i-th cuboid is `cuboids[i] = [widthi, lengthi, heighti]` (0-indexed). Choose a subset of the cuboids and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid `i` on cuboid `j` if `widthi <= widthj` and `lengthi <= lengthj` and `heighti <= heightj`. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it on another cuboid, but you can rotate only once per cuboid. Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the dimensions of a cuboid be rotated multiple times?**
    - No, each cuboid can be rotated only once to order its dimensions.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the dimensions of the cuboids?**
    - Yes, the dimensions are positive integers.

3. **Do we need to use all the cuboids?**
    - No, you can choose a subset of the cuboids to maximize the height.

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing:** For each cuboid, sort its dimensions. This will allow to handle it uniformly in further steps.
2. **Sorting:** Sort all cuboids based on their dimensions in both non-decreasing order. Specifically, sort by width, then length, and then height to facilitate the stacking process.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use a DP array where `dp[i]` indicates the maximum height achievable by stacking cuboids from `0` to `i` with `i`-th cuboid at the top. Initialize each `dp[i]` with its own height initially.
4. **Update DP Array:** For each cuboid `i`, iterate over all previous cuboids `j`. If `cuboid[j]` can be placed below `cuboid[i]`, update `dp[i]` as `max(dp[i], dp[j] + height of cuboid[i])`.
5. **Result:** The maximum value in the DP array is the result.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} cuboids
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxHeight = function(cuboids) {
    // Step 1: Normalize dimensions by sorting each cuboid
    cuboids = cuboids.map(dims => dims.sort((a, b) => a - b));
    
    // Step 2: Sort cuboids based on dimensions
    cuboids.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] != b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
        if (a[1] != b[1]) return a[1] - b[1];
        return a[2] - b[2];
    });

    const n = cuboids.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Step 3 and 4: Compute max heights using DP
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = cuboids[i][2]; // Initialize with the height of the current cuboid
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (cuboids[j][0] <= cuboids[i][0] &&
                cuboids[j][1] <= cuboids[i][1] &&
                cuboids[j][2] <= cuboids[i][2]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 5: Get the maximum value from dp array
    return Math.max(...dp);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting each cuboid takes `O(n * log(3))` and sorting all cuboids takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Dynamic Programming Calculation:** Filling the DP table involves nested loops over the cuboids so it takes `O(n^2)` time.
- **Overall:** The overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` which is dominated by the nested loops for filling the DP table.

This algorithm efficiently computes the maximum possible height by considering all possible rotations and stackings of the cuboids while ensuring that the stacking condition is met.
