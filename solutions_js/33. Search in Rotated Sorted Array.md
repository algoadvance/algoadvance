[Leetcode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l33)
### Problem Statement
You are given a rotated sorted array `nums` and an integer `target`. Suppose the array is originally sorted in ascending order, and then, at some pivot unknown to you beforehand, the array was rotated. (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`). You are to search for a given target in this array. If the target exists, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

##### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed with the coding solution, let's clarify a few details to ensure we understand the problem correctly:
1. Can we assume that there are no duplicates in the array?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the array `nums`?

Let's move forward assuming the array has no duplicates and focus on implementing the solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem in `O(log n)` time complexity, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. Here's the strategy:

1. **Determine the Midpoint:** As usual, find the midpoint of the current search range.
2. **Identify Sorted Portion:** Check which portion of the array (left or right of the midpoint) is sorted.
    - If the left portion is sorted:
        - Check if the target is within this sorted range.
        - If it is, continue the search in the left portion.
        - Otherwise, continue the search in the unsorted right portion.
    - If the right portion is sorted:
        - Check if the target is within this sorted range.
        - If it is, continue the search in the right portion.
        - Otherwise, continue the search in the unsorted left portion.
3. **Repeat until Target is Found or Search Range is Exhausted:** Continue the search until the target is found or the search range is reduced to zero.
   
### Code
Here is the implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
var search = function(nums, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }
        
        // Check if the left side is sorted
        if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        } 
        // Else, the right side must be sorted
        else {
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because, in each iteration, we reduce the search space by half.
