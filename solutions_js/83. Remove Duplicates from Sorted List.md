[Leetcode 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l83)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a sorted linked list. The list may contain duplicate values, but it is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to remove all duplicates such that each element appears only once. The function should return the sorted linked list with all duplicates removed.

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: head = [1,1,2]
  - Output: [1,2]

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
  - Output: [1,2,3]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned?**
   - The function should return the modified linked list after removing duplicates.
   
2. **What if the list is empty?**
   - If the list is empty (i.e., `head` is `null`), the function should return `null`.

3. **Is the input always a sorted linked list?**
   - Yes, the input is always a sorted linked list.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a current pointer**: Start from the head of the list.
2. **Iterate through the list**: Use a while loop to traverse the list until the end.
3. **Remove duplicates**: 
   - Check if the current node's value is the same as the next node's value.
   - If they are the same, skip the next node by updating the current node's `next` pointer to `next.next`.
   - Otherwise, move the current pointer to the next node.
4. **Continue until the end**: Repeat the above step until the end of the list is reached.
5. **Return the modified list**: Finally, return the head of the modified list.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

var deleteDuplicates = function(head) {
    if (head === null) return head;
    
    let current = head;
    
    while (current !== null && current.next !== null) {
        if (current.val === current.next.val) {
            // Skip the next node since it's a duplicate
            current.next = current.next.next;
        } else {
            // Move to the next node
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
    
    return head;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
   - We traverse each node exactly once.
   
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are modifying the list in place without using additional space for storage.
