[Leetcode 2740. Find the Value of the Partition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2740)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Partition the array into two subarrays `left` and `right` such that:

1. Every element in `left` is less than `k`.
2. Every element in `right` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Return the value of the partition which is defined as the number of distinct integers in the `left`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions "positive integers," so duplicates are possible.

2. **What should be the behavior if no elements are less than `k`?**
   - In such a case, the `left` array will be empty, and the number of distinct integers will be zero.

3. **What range can we expect for the integer `k`?**
   - The problem does not specify the range, but it implicitly needs to be positive since the array contains positive integers.

4. **Is there a specific order to maintain in the output arrays?**
   - The order is not mentioned in the problem, so we focus on counting distinct elements rather than ordering.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty set `leftSet` to store distinct integers.
2. Iterate through the array `nums` and for each element, if it is less than `k`, add it to `leftSet`.
3. The number of distinct elements will be the size of `leftSet`.

### Code

Here's an implementation following the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var findValueOfPartition = function(nums, k) {
    let leftSet = new Set();

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num < k) {
            leftSet.add(num);
        }
    }

    return leftSet.size;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We iterate over each element of `nums` once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where `m` is the number of distinct integers in the array that are less than `k`. This is because we store these distinct integers in a set.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the value of the partition with minimal overhead.
