[Leetcode 788. Rotated Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l788)
### Problem Statement:
The problem is to determine how many numbers from 1 to `N` are good numbers. A good number is a number that remains a valid number and changes to a different number when rotated 180 degrees. 

Valid digits are:
- 0, 1, and 8: they remain the same after rotation.
- 2 and 5: they change to each other after rotation.
- 6 and 9: they change to each other after rotation.

Digits 3, 4, and 7 are invalid and do not form a valid number when rotated.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `N` be 0? (No, the problem specifies numbers from 1 to `N`).
2. Should we consider numbers that remain the same as not good numbers? (Yes, numbers like 0, 1, 8 which remain unchanged are not good numbers).

### Strategy:
1. Iterate over each number from 1 to `N`.
2. For each number, determine if it's a good number by checking its digits.
3. A number is considered a good number if:
   - It only contains the digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9.
   - It contains at least one of 2, 5, 6, or 9 (to ensure it changes to a different number).
4. Maintain a count of such good numbers.

### Code:
```javascript
function rotatedDigits(N) {
    let goodNumbersCount = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        if (isGoodNumber(i)) {
            goodNumbersCount++;
        }
    }

    return goodNumbersCount;
}

function isGoodNumber(num) {
    const validDigits = new Set(['0', '1', '2', '5', '6', '8', '9']);
    const goodDigits = new Set(['2', '5', '6', '9']);
    let hasGoodDigit = false;

    let numStr = num.toString();
    
    for (let digit of numStr) {
        if (!validDigits.has(digit)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (goodDigits.has(digit)) {
            hasGoodDigit = true;
        }
    }

    return hasGoodDigit;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(rotatedDigits(10));  // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity:
- The main loop runs `N` times.
- Checking if each number is good involves examining its digits, which in the worst case takes `O(log(N))` time since the number of digits in `N` is proportional to the logarithm of `N`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(N * log(N))`.
