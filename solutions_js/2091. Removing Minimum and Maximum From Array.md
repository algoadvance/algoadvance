[Leetcode 2091. Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2091)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers, you need to remove the minimum and maximum elements from the array. You need to remove them in such a way that the number of operations performed (i.e., removing elements from either the front or the back of the array) is minimized. 

You can remove elements from:
1. The beginning of the array.
2. The end of the array.
3. Both the beginning and the end of the array (one from each).

Return the minimum number of operations required to remove both the minimum and maximum elements from the array.

### Example:

**Input:**
```javascript
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
```

**Output:**
```javascript
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The minimum element is 1 and the maximum is 5.
- Remove the element 1 by 1 operation from the front.
- Remove the element 5 by 1 operation from the back.
- Total operations = 2.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the array always has at least two elements? (Yes, since both min and max are required.)
2. Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be distinct? (Yes, as per the problem statement.)

## Strategy
1. Identify the minimum and maximum elements and their indices.
2. Calculate three potential strategies:
    - Remove both elements from the beginning and the end separately.
    - Remove both elements by reaching from the front and then the back.
    - Remove both elements by reaching from the back and then the front.
3. Calculate the number of operations for each strategy and return the minimum.

## Code

```javascript
var minimumDeletions = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n <= 2) return n;

    // Find indices of min and max elements
    const minIndex = nums.indexOf(Math.min(...nums));
    const maxIndex = nums.indexOf(Math.max(...nums));

    // sorted indices for easier reasoning
    const [leftIndex, rightIndex] = [minIndex, maxIndex].sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Option 1: Remove both from the front
    const removalsFromFront = rightIndex + 1;
    
    // Option 2: Remove both from the back
    const removalsFromBack = n - leftIndex;

    // Option 3: One from the front, one from the back
    const removalsSplit = (leftIndex + 1) + (n - rightIndex);

    return Math.min(removalsFromFront, removalsFromBack, removalsSplit);
};

// Example test case
console.log(minimumDeletions([3, 1, 4, 2, 5])); // Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity
- Finding min and max elements and their indices: **O(n)**
- Calculating potential strategies and their minimal values: **O(1)**

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array.
