[Leetcode 468. Validate IP Address](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l468)
## Problem Statement
The goal is to write a function to validate whether a given string is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, or neither.

### IPv4:
An IPv4 address is valid if:
- It consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255.
- Numbers are separated by single dots.
- There should be no leading zeros (for example, "192.168.01.1" is not valid).

### IPv6:
An IPv6 address is valid if:
- It consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.
- Numbers are separated by single colons.
- Hexadecimal digits include digits as well as 'a-f' and 'A-F'.
- Leading zeros are allowed in this case.

### Input:
- A single input string `queryIP`.

### Output:
- If the string is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".
- If the string is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".
- Otherwise, return "Neither".

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input always a non-empty string?
2. Can the input contain other characters such as spaces or punctuation that need to be handled?
3. Should we handle cases where the input may contain both IPv4 and IPv6 formatting mixed together?

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} queryIP
 * @return {string}
 */
var validIPAddress = function(queryIP) {
    // Helper function to validate IPv4
    function isValidIPv4(ip) {
        const parts = ip.split('.');
        if (parts.length !== 4) return false;
        for (const part of parts) {
            if (!/^\d+$/.test(part) || part.length === 0 || part.length > 1 && part[0] === '0' || Number(part) > 255) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Helper function to validate IPv6
    function isValidIPv6(ip) {
        const parts = ip.split(':');
        if (parts.length !== 8) return false;
        const hexRegex = /^[0-9a-fA-F]{1,4}$/;
        for (const part of parts) {
            if (!hexRegex.test(part)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    if (queryIP.includes('.')) {
        return isValidIPv4(queryIP) ? "IPv4" : "Neither";
    } else if (queryIP.includes(':')) {
        return isValidIPv6(queryIP) ? "IPv6" : "Neither";
    } else {
        return "Neither";
    }
};
```

## Strategy
1. **IPv4 Validation**:
    - Split the input string by the dot (`.`) character.
    - Ensure exactly four parts are obtained.
    - Each part must be a valid decimal number between 0 and 255.
    - No part should have leading zeros unless it is "0".
   
2. **IPv6 Validation**:
    - Split the input string by the colon (`:`) character.
    - Ensure exactly eight parts are obtained.
    - Each part must be a valid hexadecimal number (1 to 4 characters long).
    
3. **Decision Making**:
    - Check if the input contains dots (`.`) to determine if it could be IPv4.
    - Check if the input contains colons (`:`) to determine if it could be IPv6.
    - Validate accordingly and return the appropriate result, otherwise return "Neither".

## Time Complexity
- Splitting the string and checking each part involves linear scans, making it O(N) in practice, where N is the length of the string. The regex checks are also O(1) for each part validation in both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Thus, the overall complexity is O(N).
