[Leetcode 532. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l532)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where:
- `i != j`
- `a and b are both unique (meaning that if a pair is already counted, it should not be counted again)`
- `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four 1-diff pairs in the array, (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 1, 5, 4], k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: There is one 0-diff pair in the array, (1, 1).
```

**Note:**
1. `0 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
2. `-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
3. `0 <= k <= 10^7`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do you want the pairs in any specific order? 
2. Can the elements of the pair be the same if k == 0?
3. Are there any constraints on computational complexity?
4. Is it acceptable to use additional space for storing intermediate results?

Assuming reasonable answers to the above, let's proceed to solve the problem.

## Strategy
1. **Edge Cases**: If `nums.length` is 0, return 0 because no pairs exist.
2. **HashMap**: Use a hashmap (or a set) to keep track of numbers and their frequencies.
3. **Iteration**: Iterate through the hashmap keys and determine if a complement (current key + k) exists in the hashmap. 
4. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For `k > 0`, check both the number and its complement.
   - For `k == 0`, check if any number occurs more than once.

## Code
Hereâ€™s how we can implement the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
var findPairs = function(nums, k) {
    if (k < 0) return 0; // Because difference cannot be negative

    let count = 0;
    let numMap = new Map();

    // Count the frequency of each number in nums
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (numMap.has(num)) {
            numMap.set(num, numMap.get(num) + 1);
        } else {
            numMap.set(num, 1);
        }
    }

    // Check pairs
    for (let [num, freq] of numMap) {
        if (k === 0) {
            // Special case where we look for same numbers with at least 2 occurrences
            if (freq > 1) {
                count++;
            }
        } else {
            // Check if the complement number exists in the map
            if (numMap.has(num + k)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(n) - where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. 
  - We make one pass to count frequencies.
  - We make another pass to check pairs.
- **Space complexity**: O(n) - for storing the frequency of each number in the hashmap. 

This solution is efficient and well within acceptable limits for the given constraints leveraging two linear passes and hash-based lookups.
