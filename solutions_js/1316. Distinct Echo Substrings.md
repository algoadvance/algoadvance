[Leetcode 1316. Distinct Echo Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1316)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `text`, return the number of distinct non-empty substrings of `text` that can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself (i.e., it can be written as `a + a` where `a` is a non-empty substring of `text`).

Example:
```
Input: text = "abcabcabc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 substrings are "abcabc" (a = "abc"), "bcabca" (a = "bca"), and "cabcab" (a = "cab").
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are we only considering substrings that can be expressed exactly as two concatenations of the same substring? 
   - Yes, only substrings that are exactly double the length of some other substring.
2. Should the substrings be contiguous?
   - Yes, all substrings considered are contiguous parts of the given text.
3. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - Constraints are generally within typical LeetCode problem ranges, e.g., 1 <= text.length <= 1000.

## Strategy
1. Generate all possible substrings of the input text.
2. Check if each substring can be evenly split into two equal halves. If they are, the halves must be identical for the substring to be considered an echo substring.
3. Use a set to keep track of unique echo substrings, ensuring that only distinct substrings are counted.
4. Return the count of the unique echo substrings.

## Code
```javascript
var distinctEchoSubstrings = function(text) {
    let echoSubstrings = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; ++i) {
        for (let len = 1; i + 2 * len <= text.length; ++len) {
            let firstHalf = text.substr(i, len);
            let secondHalf = text.substr(i + len, len);
            if (firstHalf === secondHalf) {
                echoSubstrings.add(text.substr(i, 2 * len));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return echoSubstrings.size;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(distinctEchoSubstrings("abcabcabc")); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
1. Outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of the text.
2. Inner loop runs such that we check up to `n/2` possible substring lengths for each character in the array.
3. Each substring check has a complexity linear to its length, but in practice, we are only making pairwise comparison for substring equality.

Overall time complexity is approximately O(n^2). The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the storage of substrings in the set. This should be efficient enough given the typical constraints.
