[Leetcode 1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1775)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2` with integer values ranging from 1 to 6. In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value from 1 to 6.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sums of the two arrays equal, or return -1 if it is not possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraint on the length of arrays:**
   - What is the maximum length of `nums1` and `nums2`?
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the return value if both arrays are already equal?
   - How do we handle arrays of size 1?

Once you confirm these, let's move on to the strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of both arrays, `sum1` for `nums1` and `sum2` for `nums2`.
   - Check if `sum1` is already equal to `sum2`. If it is, return 0.

2. **Difference Calculation:**
   - Calculate the difference `diff = abs(sum1 - sum2)`. This is the amount we need to change to make the sums equal.

3. **Priority Queue for Maximum Impact:**
   - Create a list of all possible changes you can make to the elements, given the constraint of changing any number to any number between 1 and 6.
   - Sort this list in descending order based on the absolute changes you can make.
   - Apply these changes greedily to reduce the difference `diff` in the minimum number of operations.

4. **Edge Case Checks:**
   - If the total possible change is less than `diff`, return -1.

### Code

```javascript
var minOperations = function(nums1, nums2) {
    const sum1 = nums1.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    const sum2 = nums2.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    
    if (sum1 === sum2) return 0;
    
    let diff = Math.abs(sum1 - sum2);
    
    let changes = [];
    for (const num of nums1) {
        changes.push(num - 1); // max decrement
    }
    for (const num of nums2) {
        changes.push(6 - num); // max increment
    }
    changes.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    let operations = 0;
    
    for (const change of changes) {
        diff -= change;
        operations++;
        if (diff <= 0) return operations;
    }
    
    return -1;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sum Calculation:** O(n + m), where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`.
- **Change List Creation:** O(n + m).
- **Sorting Changes:** O((n + m) log(n + m)).
- **Processing Changes:** O(n + m).

Hence the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it **O((n + m) log(n + m))**.

### Conclusion

The proposed solution efficiently calculates the minimum operations required to make the sum of two arrays equal by leveraging a greedy approach with a priority queue-like mechanism to maximize the impact of each operation.
