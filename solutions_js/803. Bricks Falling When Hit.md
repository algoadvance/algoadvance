[Leetcode 803. Bricks Falling When Hit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l803)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and each 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:

- It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or 
- At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.

You are also given an array `hits`, which represents the cells where bricks will be removed. After each removal, the grid is updated, and you must calculate the number of bricks that will fall. Fallen bricks are defined as bricks that are no longer stable after the hit.

Return an array, where each element represents the number of bricks that will fall after the corresponding hit.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are all the hits guaranteed to be valid, i.e., they will only hit brick cells?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume that each hit corresponds to a brick cell.

2. **Q:** Do the bricks removed by hits disappear forever or do they reappear after each hit?
   - **A:** The bricks removed by calling hits disappear forever.

3. **Q:** Will there be a hit that hits a cell more than once?
   - **A:** No, each hit is a unique brick cell.

4. **Q:** Can the grid be modified during the operation of hits?
   - **A:** Yes, the grid will be updated after each hit as bricks are removed.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Make a copy of the grid to simulate the removal of bricks by the hits.
   - Temporary removal: Apply all hits initially and mark those positions as empty.
   
2. **Identify Stable Bricks Initially:**
   - Use Union-Find data structure to mark all bricks that are initially stable (direct connection to the top or connected to other stable bricks).
   
3. **Process Hits in Reverse Order:**
   - Reverse the hits and re-add each hit one by one.
   - After adding each hit, use the Union-Find structure to determine which surrounding (recently added) bricks become stable.
   
4. **Count Fallen Bricks:**
   - For each hit, count the bricks that lose stability and fall after the hit is once again placed back and connections are re-established.
   
5. **Use Union-Find Efficiently:**
   - Implement weighted union and path compression for efficiency.

### Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
  constructor(size) {
    this.parent = Array(size).fill(0).map((_, index) => index);
    this.rank = Array(size).fill(1); 
    this.size = Array(size).fill(1);
  }

  find(x) {
    if (x != this.parent[x]) {
      this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
    }
    return this.parent[x];
  }

  union(x, y) {
    let rootX = this.find(x);
    let rootY = this.find(y);

    if (rootX != rootY) {
      if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        this.size[rootX] += this.size[rootY];
      } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
        this.size[rootY] += this.size[rootX];
      } else {
        this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        this.size[rootX] += this.size[rootY];
        this.rank[rootX] += 1;
      }
    }
  }

  isConnected(x, y) {
    return this.find(x) == this.find(y);
  }

  getSize(x) {
    return this.size[this.find(x)];
  }
}

var hitBricks = function(grid, hits) {
  const m = grid.length;
  const n = grid[0].length;
  
  // Convert hit grid to remember original state and new state
  const copy = grid.map(row => row.slice());
  
  for (const [x, y] of hits) {
    copy[x][y] = 0;
  }

  const unionFind = new UnionFind(m * n + 1);
  const top = m * n; // Virtual top node

  const index = (r, c) => r * n + c;

  const directions = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]];

  const isInBounds = (r, c) => r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n;

  for (let r = 0; r < m; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
      if (copy[r][c] == 1) {
        if (r == 0) {
          unionFind.union(index(r, c), top);
        }
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
          let nr = r + dr;
          let nc = c + dc;
          if (isInBounds(nr, nc) && copy[nr][nc] == 1) {
            unionFind.union(index(r, c), index(nr, nc));
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  const results = [];

  while (hits.length) {
    const [x, y] = hits.pop();
    if (grid[x][y] == 0) {
      results.unshift(0);
      continue;
    }

    const preSize = unionFind.getSize(top);
    
    if (x == 0) {
      unionFind.union(index(x, y), top);
    }

    for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
      const nr = x + dr;
      const nc = y + dc;
      if (isInBounds(nr, nc) && copy[nr][nc] == 1) {
        unionFind.union(index(x, y), index(nr, nc));
      }
    }
    
    copy[x][y] = 1;

    const newSize = unionFind.getSize(top);
    results.unshift(Math.max(0, newSize - preSize - 1));
  }

  return results;  
};
```

### Time Complexity
The overall time complexity is `O((m * n + k) * α(m * n))`, where `k` is the number of hits, and `α` is the Inverse Ackermann function which is very slow-growing and can be considered nearly constant. This complexity arises from the Union-Find operations which are nearly constant due to path compression and rank optimization.
