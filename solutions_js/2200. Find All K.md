[Leetcode 2200. Find All K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2200)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A k-distant index is an index `i` of `nums` for which there exists at least one index `j` such that `|i - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key`.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no k-distant indices are found?**
   - The function should return an empty array.

2. **Can the input array `nums` be empty?**
   - Yes, in that case, the function should return an empty array.

3. **What is the range of numbers in `nums`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify constraints, but typically `nums` can contain any integer values.

4. **What are the constraints on the inputs sizes (length of `nums`, value of `k`, etc.)?**
   - This will affect whether a particular solution is feasible in terms of time complexity.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Key Indices:** 
   - First, identify all indices `j` where `nums[j] == key`.

2. **Determine k-Distant Indices:** 
   - For each identified index `j`, determine the range of indices `i` that are at most `k` away from `j`.
   - Collect all such indices in a set to avoid duplicates.

3. **Sort the Results:** 
   - Convert the set of indices into a sorted array.

### Time Complexity

- Finding key indices is O(n) where n is the length of `nums`.
- Determining the k-distant indices is O(m*k) where m is the number of key indices.
- Sorting the final set of indices will be O(p log p) where p is the number of unique k-distant indices.
  
Given these steps, the overall time complexity should be manageable for typical input sizes.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} key
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findKDistantIndices = function(nums, key, k) {
    let keyIndices = [];
    
    // Step 1: Identify all indices where nums[j] == key
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] === key) {
            keyIndices.push(j);
        }
    }

    let result = new Set();
    
    // Step 2: Determine k-distant indices
    for (let j of keyIndices) {
        for (let i = Math.max(0, j - k); i <= Math.min(nums.length - 1, j + k); i++) {
            result.add(i);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Convert set to a sorted array
    return Array.from(result).sort((a, b) => a - b);
};

// Example usage
let nums = [3, 4, 9, 1, 3, 9, 5];
let key = 9;
let k = 1;
console.log(findKDistantIndices(nums, key, k)); // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this solution, we use a set to keep track of all k-distant indices to avoid duplicates automatically, and it subsequently allows generating a sorted array of indices efficiently. This approach ensures we handle the problem constraints effectively.
