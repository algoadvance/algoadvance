[Leetcode 2421. Number of Good Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2421)
## Problem Statement

A **path** in a graph is a sequence of nodes where every adjacent pair of nodes is connected by an edge. A **good path** is a path where the maximum value of the nodes is unique among all paths. Given a tree (an undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes and an array `vals` where `vals[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` node, find the number of good paths.

### Inputs:

1. `n`: an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
2. `edges`: a 2D array where each element is a pair `[u, v]`, indicating an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
3. `vals`: an array of integers where `vals[i]` is the value of the `i-th` node.

### Outputs:

Return the number of good paths in the given tree.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `vals` contain duplicate values?
2. Will `edges` always represent a valid tree?
3. Is there an upper limit on the number of nodes or value size constraints we need to consider?
4. Are values in `vals` guaranteed to be non-negative?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use an algorithm similar to Kruskal's with union-find but with additional processing based on the values. The steps are as follows:

1. **Sort Edges**: First, we sort all edges based on the maximum value of their two nodes.
2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use the union-find data structure to manage connected components.
3. **Processing Nodes by Value**: Process nodes in the increasing order of their values. This means we treat nodes with smaller values earlier.
4. **Counting Good Paths**:
    - Initialize `good_paths` to the number of single-node paths as each node itself can be considered a path.
    - For each value, consider all edges connecting nodes of this value.
    - Use union-find to manage connected components and count paths.

The solution keeps track of connected components and updates the count of good paths as it processes each node and edge.

## Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation of the given strategy:

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array(size).fill(0).map((_, idx) => idx);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(node) {
        if (this.parent[node] !== node) {
            this.parent[node] = this.find(this.parent[node]);
        }
        return this.parent[node];
    }

    union(node1, node2) {
        const root1 = this.find(node1);
        const root2 = this.find(node2);

        if (root1 !== root2) {
            if (this.rank[root1] > this.rank[root2]) {
                this.parent[root2] = root1;
            } else if (this.rank[root1] < this.rank[root2]) {
                this.parent[root1] = root2;
            } else {
                this.parent[root2] = root1;
                this.rank[root1] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

function numberOfGoodPaths(vals, edges) {
    const n = vals.length;
    const edgeList = [];

    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        edgeList.push({ u, v, maxVal: Math.max(vals[u], vals[v]) });
    }

    // Sort edges based on the maximum value of the nodes connected by the edge
    edgeList.sort((a, b) => a.maxVal - b.maxVal);

    const uf = new UnionFind(n);
    let goodPaths = n;

    const valueToNodes = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!valueToNodes.has(vals[i])) {
            valueToNodes.set(vals[i], []);
        }
        valueToNodes.get(vals[i]).push(i);
    }

    for (const { u, v, maxVal } of edgeList) {
        const rootU = uf.find(u);
        const rootV = uf.find(v);
        if (rootU !== rootV) {
            if (vals[rootU] === vals[rootV]) {
                goodPaths += 1;
            }
            uf.union(u, v);
        }
    }

    return goodPaths;
}

// Example usage:
const vals = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3];
const edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]];
console.log(numberOfGoodPaths(vals, edges)); // Output: Number of good paths
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Edges**: \(O(E \log E)\)
- **Union-Find Operations**: Approximately \(O(\alpha(N))\) time per operation where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Overall Complexity**: \(O(N + E \log E)\) where `N` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges.

By combining sorting with union-find operations efficiently, we can ensure the solution is both performant and suitable for typical interview constraints.
