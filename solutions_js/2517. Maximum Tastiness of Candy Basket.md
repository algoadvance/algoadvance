[Leetcode 2517. Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2517)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `price` representing the price of candies, and a positive integer `k`. In each basket you can put exactly `k` candies. Your goal is to minimize the difference in total price between the most expensive basket and the least expensive basket. You will return the minimum difference possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Length**: What is the maximum length of the `price` array?
2. **Duplicate Prices**: Can there be duplicate values in the `price` array?
3. **Value Range**: What is the range of values for prices and for `k`?
4. **Output**: Should the difference be an absolute value or can it be negative?

Once these clarifications are made, solving the problem involves ensuring that each basket's total price is as uniform as possible.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the `price` array. Sorting helps in easily grouping closest values together, which should ideally minimize the difference between the groups.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to calculate differences in sums for grouping indices.
3. **Calculate Minimum Difference**: Traverse the `prices` array using the sliding window and compute the sum differences between the first and the last element in the window. Update the minimum difference accordingly.

## Code

Below is the implementation of the strategy in JavaScript.

```javascript
function minimumDifference(price, k) {
    // If k is 1, the difference is always 0 because we are picking individual candy prices.
    if (k == 1) return 0;

    // Sort array to facilitate finding minimal differences easily.
    price.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDifference = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i <= price.length - k; i++) {
        // Difference between the maximum and minimum in the current window of size k
        let currentDifference = price[i + k - 1] - price[i];
        // Update the minimal difference
        minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, currentDifference);
    }

    return minDifference;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Sliding Window Calculation**: Going through the array with a sliding window of size \(k\) takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, which dominates the linear pass through the array.

This method ensures that we find the minimal difference possible between the most expensive and least expensive groups of `k` candies.
