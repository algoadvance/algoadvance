[Leetcode 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1566)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of positive integers `arr`, find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated at least `k` times consecutively.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What should be the return value?
   - If such a pattern exists, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
2. Are `m` and `k` guaranteed to be valid integers within specific ranges?
   - Yes, the constraints ensure that `m` and `k` are valid integers.
3. What should be the behavior if `m` is greater than the length of the array?
   - Pattern detection is not possible, so return `False`.
4. Can the integers in the array be repeated?
   - Yes, the integers in the array may be repeated.

### Strategy:

1. Iterate over the array and use a sliding window to examine possible patterns of length `m`.
2. For each starting point in the array, check if the pattern is repeated `k` times consecutively.
3. Utilize nested loops: the outer loop slides the window across the array, and the inner loop verifies the repetition of the pattern.
4. If a valid pattern is found, return `True`. Otherwise, after exhausting all options, return `False`.

### Code:

```javascript
function containsPattern(arr, m, k) {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= n - m * k; i++) {
        let patternMatch = true;
        
        for (let j = 0; j < m * k; j++) {
            if (arr[i + j] !== arr[i + j % m + i]) {
                patternMatch = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (patternMatch) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(containsPattern([1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4], 1, 3)); // Should print true
console.log(containsPattern([1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3], 2, 2)); // Should print true
console.log(containsPattern([1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3], 2, 3)); // Should print false
console.log(containsPattern([1, 2, 3, 1, 2], 2, 2)); // Should print false
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is \(O(n \times m \times k)\), where `n` is the length of the array, `m` is the length of the pattern, and `k` is the number of times the pattern should be repeated. In the worst case, the code inspects every potential starting point and compares up to `m * k` elements for each starting point, resulting in the quadratic term.
