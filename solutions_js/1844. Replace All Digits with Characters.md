[Leetcode 1844. Replace All Digits with Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1844)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.

There is a function shift(c, x), where `c` is a character and `x` is a digit, that shifts `c` forward in the alphabet by `x` positions. If `x` has no effect, the character remains the same.

You need to replace all digits in `s` with the appropriate characters such that the resulting string only contains lowercase English letters.

For example, if the string `s` is "a1c1e1," then shifting `a` by `1` will result in `b`, shifting `c` by `1` will result in `d`, and shifting `e` by `1` will result in `f`. Thus the resulting string is "abcdef".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** 
   - Is the length of the string `s` always even?
   - Is the input string guaranteed to only contain valid characters (lowercase letters at even index and digits at odd index)?

2. **Output format:**
   - Should the function return the modified string or print it?

Assuming the input constraints are met as per the problem statement: the string always has lowercase letters in even indices and digits in odd indices.

### Strategy

1. Iterate over the input string `s`.
2. Use a loop to check each character in the string.
3. For even indices, keep the character as it is.
4. For odd indices, convert the digit to an integer and shift the preceding character by the digit's value in the alphabet.
5. Use the `String.fromCharCode` and `String.charCodeAt` functions to perform the shifting.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve this problem:

```javascript
function replaceDigits(s) {
    let result = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            result += s[i];
        } else {
            const prevChar = s[i - 1];
            const shiftAmount = parseInt(s[i], 10);
            const newChar = String.fromCharCode(prevChar.charCodeAt(0) + shiftAmount);
            result += newChar;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(replaceDigits("a1c1e1")); // Output: "abcdef"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once.

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty string `result`.
- **Iteration:** We iterate through the string `s`:
  - If the index `i` is even, the character is added directly to `result`.
  - If the index `i` is odd, we calculate the shifted character using the previous character and the digit at the current index, then append it to `result`.
- **Return:** Finally, we return the accumulated `result` string.
