[Leetcode 1599. Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1599)
### Problem Statement

The Centennial Wheel has four gondolas, and each gondola can carry up to 4 customers. You have `n` customers waiting, and `customers[i]` indicates the number of customers arriving at the `i-th` rotation of the wheel.

You are allowed to operate the wheel for at most `4 * n` rotations, or until there are no more customers left, whichever happens first. Each rotation costs `runningCost`, and you earn `boardingCost` for each customer who boards the wheel.

Your task is to return the smallest number of rotations such that the profit is maximized. If there is no way to achieve a positive profit, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What happens if customers keep arriving in numbers exceeding the carrying capacity of a single rotation?
   - The customers can be queued, and they can board in the subsequent rotations until there are no more customers or the maximum of `4 * n` rotations is reached.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```javascript
var minOperationsMaxProfit = function(customers, boardingCost, runningCost) {
    let maxProfit = 0;
    let currentProfit = 0;
    let waitingCustomers = 0;
    let totalBoarded = 0;
    let rotations = 0;
    let result = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < customers.length || waitingCustomers > 0; i++) {
        if (i < customers.length) {
            waitingCustomers += customers[i];
        }

        // Number of customers that can board in this rotation
        let boarding = Math.min(4, waitingCustomers);

        // Increment total customers who boarded
        totalBoarded += boarding;
        waitingCustomers -= boarding;

        // Increment rotations
        rotations++;

        // Calculate current profit
        currentProfit = totalBoarded * boardingCost - rotations * runningCost;

        // Update max profit and result rotation
        if (currentProfit > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = currentProfit;
            result = rotations;
        }
    }

    return maxProfit > 0 ? result : -1;
};
```

### Strategy

1. Initialize `maxProfit` to keep track of the highest profit encountered.
2. Initialize `currentProfit` to zero to track the profit incrementally.
3. Initialize `waitingCustomers` to zero to keep track of customers waiting to board.
4. Initialize `totalBoarded` and `rotations` to zero to keep track of total boarded customers and number of rotations.
5. Initialize `result` to `-1` to store the result rotation with maximum profit.

Iterate through each customer group arriving per rotation:
- Add arriving customers to `waitingCustomers`.
- Determine the number of customers that can board in this rotation (maximum 4 or less if customers are less).
- Update total boarded customers and decrement waiting customers accordingly.
- Calculate current profit considering boarding cost and running cost.
- Update maxProfit and set the result rotation if currentProfit exceeds maxProfit.

Return the result rotation if a positive profit was achieved, otherwise return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of customer groups arriving at different rotations. The while loop ensures we process up to `4 * n` rotations in the worst scenario.
