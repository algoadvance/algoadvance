[Leetcode 1496. Path Crossing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1496)
Sure, let's work through the problem together.

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `path`, where `path[i]` represents the direction ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') to move at the `i-th` step. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk according to the directions given in the path. Your task is to determine if your path crosses itself at any point.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `path`?**
   - There's no mention of specific constraints, but Leetcode problems typically manage reasonable string lengths ranging from 1 to 10,000 characters.

2. **Can we assume the input path only consists of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'?**
   - Yes, based on the problem statement, those are the only valid characters.

3. **What should be returned if there is no crossing?**
   - You should return `false` if there is no crossing and `true` if the path does cross itself.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure**: We'll use a Set to store visited coordinates.
2. **Tracking Movement**: Start at the origin `(0, 0)`.
3. **Processing the Path**:
   - Translate each character in the path to a coordinate movement:
     - 'N' -> move up (y + 1)
     - 'S' -> move down (y - 1)
     - 'E' -> move right (x + 1)
     - 'W' -> move left (x - 1)
4. **Check for Previously Visited Coordinates**:
   - For each new coordinate, check if it is already in the set.
   - If it is, return `true` (crossing found).
   - Otherwise, add it to the set and continue.
5. **Final Return**: If no crossing is found after processing the entire path, return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} path
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function isPathCrossing(path) {
    let x = 0, y = 0; // starting coordinates
    let visited = new Set();
    
    // Add starting point to the set
    visited.add(`${x},${y}`);
    
    for (const direction of path) {
        switch (direction) {
            case 'N':
                y += 1;
                break;
            case 'S':
                y -= 1;
                break;
            case 'E':
                x += 1;
                break;
            case 'W':
                x -= 1;
                break;
        }
        
        const coordinate = `${x},${y}`;
        if (visited.has(coordinate)) {
            return true; // path crosses
        }
        
        visited.add(coordinate);
    }
    
    return false; // no crossing found
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution operates in O(n) time complexity:
- `n` represents the length of the input string `path`.
- We're iterating over the string once, and each operation within the loop is O(1) due to Set operations (add/check).

Space complexity is also O(n):
- In the worst case, every position visited is unique, and we store `n` coordinates in the Set.

This should be efficient for typical input sizes found in Leetcode problems.
