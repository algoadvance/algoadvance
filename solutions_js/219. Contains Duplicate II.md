[Leetcode 219. Contains Duplicate II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l219)
### Problem Statement:

We are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to determine if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Range**:
   - What are the limits on the size of the array? (Typical constraint for such problems would be 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5)
   - What is the range of values within `nums`? (Typically, each element within a range, say -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9)

2. **Output**:
   - What should we return if such indices exist? (We return `true`).
   - What should we return if no such indices exist? (We return `false`).
  
3. **Special Cases**:
   - How should we handle empty arrays or small values of `k`? (Like an array with less than two elements, or k = 0).
     - If `k` = 0, we should return `false` as no two indices can satisfy the requirement.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash map (or JavaScript's `Map`) to track the last seen index of each number. Here's a step-by-step strategy:
1. Iterate over the array.
2. For each element:
   - Check if the element is already in the map.
   - If it is, compare the current index with the stored index. If their difference is at most `k`, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, update the map with the current index of the element.
3. If no such pairs are found during the iteration, return `false`.

### Code Implementation:

```javascript
function containsNearbyDuplicate(nums, k) {
    let map = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Check if the current element is in the map
        if (map.has(nums[i])) {
            // Check the difference in indices
            if (i - map.get(nums[i]) <= k) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // Update the map with the current index
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once, and each operation involving the hash map (check and update) is O(1) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, k)), as the space used by the hash map depends on the number of elements and their indices being tracked, but it will not require more than `k` elements stored simultaneously, since once the current index surpasses `k`, indices `i-k-1` are no longer relevant.

Feel free to run this implementation with some test cases to verify its correctness.
