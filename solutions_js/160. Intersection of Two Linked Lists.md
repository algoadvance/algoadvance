[Leetcode 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l160)
### Problem Statement

Write a program that finds the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins. 

**Example:**

```
Input: 
    List A:       4 -> 1
                         \
                          8 -> 4 -> 5
                         /
    List B: 5 -> 6 -> 1

Output: Intersection at node with value 8
```

**Notes:**
- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the linked lists be empty (i.e., the heads are `null`)?
2. Is it possible for the intersection to start at the head of either list?
3. Should the comparison of nodes be based on value or on reference?

Assuming the answers are:
1. Yes, the linked lists can be empty.
2. Yes, the intersection can start at the head.
3. The comparison should be based on reference, not value.

### Strategy

1. **Length Calculation**:
   - Calculate the lengths of both linked lists.

2. **Align Starting Points**:
   - Align the starting points of both linked lists by skipping nodes in the longer list.

3. **Intersection Check**:
   - Traverse both lists in tandem to find the intersection node.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} headA
 * @param {ListNode} headB
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    if (headA === null || headB === null) return null;

    // Helper function to calculate the length of a linked list
    const getLength = (head) => {
        let length = 0;
        while (head !== null) {
            length++;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return length;
    };

    let lenA = getLength(headA);
    let lenB = getLength(headB);

    // Adjust starting point of the longer list
    while (lenA > lenB) {
        headA = headA.next;
        lenA--;
    }

    while (lenB > lenA) {
        headB = headB.next;
        lenB--;
    }

    // Traverse both lists in tandem and find the intersection point
    while (headA !== headB) {
        headA = headA.next;
        headB = headB.next;
    }

    return headA;
};
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of linked list A and B respectively. This includes:
- O(n) for calculating the length of list A.
- O(m) for calculating the length of list B.
- O(max(n, m)) for aligning and traversing both lists to find the intersection.

**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the intersection node with optimal time and space complexity.
