[Leetcode 2734. Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2734)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are allowed to make one operation: choose a non-empty substring and remove it. Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after performing the operation exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters can the string contain?**
   - The string can contain lowercase English letters only.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - The maximum length of the string \( n \) can be reasonably large, e.g., \( 10^5 \).

3. **Is removing the entire string allowed?**
   - Since the result needs to be a string, removing the entire string isn't a valid operation.

4. **Are there any constraints on the substring length?**
   - The substring must be non-empty.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest string possible after removing one contiguous substring. The strategy involves finding which part of the string can be removed to achieve this.

1. **Iterate through possible removal positions**:
   - For each position in the string, consider removing every possible substring starting from that position to the end.
   - Keep track of the lexicographically smallest result found during these iterations.

2. **Compare resulting strings**:
   - As we consider removing each substring, we compare the remaining string with the current smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings with all identical characters, e.g., "aaaaa".
   - Removing characters that might create the earliest possible alphabet, e.g., if "a" is present, removing other characters might retain "a".

### Code Implementation
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var smallestStringAfterRemoval = function(s) {
    let smallest = s;
    let n = s.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            let newString = s.slice(0, i) + s.slice(j + 1);
            if (newString < smallest) {
                smallest = newString;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return smallest;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestStringAfterRemoval("abc")); // Expected output: "ab" (Remove "c")
console.log(smallestStringAfterRemoval("aab")); // Expected output: "aa" (Remove "b")
```
### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^3) \).
  - Two nested loops run from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \), generating \( O(n^2) \) substrings.
  - Each removal operation involves string concatenation and comparison, which could take \( O(n) \).

Given the potential input size (\( 10^5 \)), an \( O(n^3) \) approach would be too slow. Therefore, we need a more efficient solution.

### Improved Strategy

1. **Direct Character Removal**:
   - Identify the earliest leftmost character which, when removed, results in a lexicographically smaller string.
   - Essentially, we need to find the first character that is greater than the next character.

### Improved Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var smallestStringAfterRemoval = function(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] > s[i + 1]) {
            return s.slice(0, i) + s.slice(i + 1);
        }
    }
    // If no such character is found, remove the last character
    return s.slice(0, n - 1);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestStringAfterRemoval("abc")); // Expected output: "ab" (Remove "c")
console.log(smallestStringAfterRemoval("aab")); // Expected output: "aa" (Remove "b")
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
  - We only need to inspect each character once, resulting in a linear time complexity, which is efficient for large inputs.

This solution effectively reduces the time complexity to be suitable for large input sizes while ensuring we obtain the lexicographically smallest result.
