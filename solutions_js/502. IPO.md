[Leetcode 502. IPO](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l502)
## Problem Statement
You are given several projects. For each project, you know the amount of capital needed to start the project and the profit that you will earn upon completing it. You are initially given `W` capital. You can only start at most `k` distinct projects. Your goal is to maximize your total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

**Formally, you can choose a list of at most `k` different projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and you can start one project only if you have the capital equal to or greater than the required capital for that project.**

**Example:**
```
Input: k = 2, W = 0, Profits = [1,2,3], Capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4

Explanation:
1. Start the project that you can start with W = 0, so you get profit = 1. Your total capital becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
2. Start the project that you can start with W = 1, so you get profit = 2. Your total capital becomes 1 + 2 = 3.
3. Output the final total capital, which is 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can profits and capital values be negative?
    - Typically, profits and capital values are non-negative integers.
  
2. Is it guaranteed that `Profits` and `Capital` arrays are of the same length?
    - Yes, it's implied that every project has a corresponding profit and capital value.

3. Can we start a project that requires 0 capital?
    - Yes, if a project requires 0 capital, it can be started anytime.

4. What should we do if `k` exceeds the number of available projects?
    - Even if `k` exceeds the number of projects, we can only start the available number of projects.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. Use a max heap to always pick the project with the highest profit that we can afford at any given point in time.
2. Use a priority queue (implemented as a min-heap) to manage and retrieve projects based on the capital required to start them.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Pair up each profit with its corresponding capital requirement.
2. Use a min-heap to keep track of projects by the capital required.
3. Iterate up to `k` times:
   - Move all affordable projects (projects that need <= current capital) from the min-heap to the max-heap.
   - If no projects can be afforded and there are iterations left, break out early.
   - Extract the most profitable project from the max-heap and update the current capital.
4. Return the final capital after selecting at most `k` projects.

## Code

```javascript
class MaxHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }

  insert(value) {
    this.heap.push(value);
    this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
  }

  extractMax() {
    if (this.heap.length < 2) return this.heap.pop();
    const max = this.heap[0];
    this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
    this.bubbleDown(0);
    return max;
  }

  bubbleUp(index) {
    while (index > 0) {
      let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
      if (this.heap[parentIndex] >= this.heap[index]) break;
      [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]] = [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]];
      index = parentIndex;
    }
  }

  bubbleDown(index) {
    const length = this.heap.length;
    const element = this.heap[index];

    while (true) {
      let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
      let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
      let largest = index;

      if (leftChildIndex < length && this.heap[leftChildIndex] > element) {
        largest = leftChildIndex;
      }

      if (rightChildIndex < length && this.heap[rightChildIndex] > this.heap[largest]) {
        largest = rightChildIndex;
      }

      if (largest === index) break;
      [this.heap[index], this.heap[largest]] = [this.heap[largest], this.heap[index]];
      index = largest;
    }
  }
}

var findMaximizedCapital = function(k, W, Profits, Capital) {
  let projects = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Profits.length; i++) {
    projects.push([Capital[i], Profits[i]]);
  }
  
  projects.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  let minCapitalHeap = projects;
  let maxProfitHeap = new MaxHeap();
  let currentCapital = W;
  let i = 0;

  while (k > 0) {
    while (i < minCapitalHeap.length && minCapitalHeap[i][0] <= currentCapital) {
      maxProfitHeap.insert(minCapitalHeap[i][1]);
      i++;
    }

    if (maxProfitHeap.heap.length === 0) break;
    
    currentCapital += maxProfitHeap.extractMax();
    k--;
  }

  return currentCapital;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of projects.
- Each project can be pushed and popped from the heap in \(O(\log n)\) times.
- The overall complexity for up to `k` iterations is \(O(n \log n + k \log n)\).

Thus, the time complexity is primarily dominated by \(O(n \log n)\).

This should be efficient enough for most practical cases available in coding interviews.
