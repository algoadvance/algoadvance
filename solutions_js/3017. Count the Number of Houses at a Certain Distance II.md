[Leetcode 3017. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3017)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of house numbers `houses` and an integer `distance`. You need to write a function `countHousesAtDistance(houses, distance)` that returns the number of pairs of houses that are exactly `distance` apart.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values in the `houses` array?
   - Is the `houses` array sorted?
   - Can the values in `houses` be negative?
   - What is the range of `distance`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return a count or the actual pairs?

Assuming the constraints are:
- `houses` may not be sorted and can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The `distance` is a non-negative integer.
- The function should return the count of pairs.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Input Array**:
   - Although sorting will cost \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity, it will simplify finding pairs using a two-pointer technique.

2. **Two-pointer Technique**:
   - Maintain two pointers, starting both at the beginning of the sorted array.
   - Iterate through the array and compare the difference of the values at the two pointers with the given `distance`.
   - If the difference is less than `distance`, move the right pointer to the right.
   - If the difference is more than `distance`, move the left pointer to the right.
   - If the difference is exactly `distance`, count the pair and move both pointers.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where there are duplicate houses.
   - Handle cases where there are fewer than 2 houses.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Two-pointer pair counting: \(O(n)\)
Total Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)

### Code

```javascript
function countHousesAtDistance(houses, distance) {
    // Edge case: if there are fewer than 2 houses
    if (houses.length < 2) return 0;

    // Sort the array
    houses.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    while (right < houses.length) {
        let diff = houses[right] - houses[left];
        
        if (diff === distance) {
            count++;
            right++;
            left++;
        } else if (diff < distance) {
            right++;
        } else {
            left++;
        }
        
        // Prevent left and right pointers being the same
        if (left === right) {
            right++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
   - Initially, we sort the houses list to efficiently search for pairs.

2. **Two Pointers Initialization**:
   - Both `left` and `right` start at the beginning of the array.

3. **Loop through the Array**:
   - Calculate the difference between the right and left pointers.
   - Depending on the difference, adjust the pointers:
     - If the difference is less than the target distance, increment the right pointer.
     - If the difference is greater, increment the left pointer.
     - If the difference matches, count the pair, and increment both pointers to find new pairs.

This approach ensures that all pairs are counted without unnecessary comparisons, making it efficient with \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity due to sorting, followed by \(O(n)\) traversal using the two pointers.
