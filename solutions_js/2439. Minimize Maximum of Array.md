[Leetcode 2439. Minimize Maximum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2439)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer array `nums`. The value of the array is defined as the maximum element in the array. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose any two adjacent elements and replace the larger one with the integer division of its sum with the smaller one (i.e., floor((nums[i] + nums[i+1]) / 2)).

Your goal is to minimize the value of the array as much as possible.

Return the minimum possible value of the array.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [10, 20, 30]
Output: 15
Explanation: The output can be obtained by performing the following steps:
- Choose nums[1] and nums[2], update nums[2] = floor((20 + 30) / 2) = 25, resulting array is [10, 20, 25].
- Choose nums[0] and nums[1], update nums[1] = floor((10 + 20) / 2) = 15, resulting array is [10, 15, 25].
- Choose nums[0] and nums[1], update nums[1] = floor((10 + 15) / 2) = 12, resulting array is [10, 12, 25].
- Choose nums[1] and nums[2], update nums[2] = floor((12 + 25) / 2) = 18, resulting array is [10, 12, 18].
- Choose nums[0] and nums[1], update nums[1] = floor((10 + 12) / 2) = 11, resulting array is [10, 11, 18].
- Choose nums[1] and nums[2], update nums[2] = floor((11 + 18) / 2) = 14, resulting array is [10, 11, 14].
The maximum element in the final array is `14`, which is the smallest possible value.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is there a limit on the size of the array?
   - No specific limit is given, we'll assume it can be reasonably large.
2. Are all elements guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, all elements are guaranteed to be positive integers.
3. Do we need to minimize the maximum element in the array as efficiently as possible?
   - Yes, the goal is to perform this operation efficiently.

## Strategy

In this problem, we need to minimize the maximum element in the array using allowed operations. The key insight here involves leveraging binary search to determine the minimum possible maximum value.

* Here's the overall approach:
  1. **Determine boundaries**: Identify the initial range for our binary search. The minimum possible value is the average of all elements in the array (`sum(nums) / n`).
  2. **Binary Search**: Perform a binary search within the defined range, checking for each mid-value if it can be the maximum value by simulating the number of operations allowed to ensure all elements are less than or equal to mid.
  3. **Simulation**: Use a greedy approach during the simulation to ensure the maximum value of elements in the array does not exceed the mid-value.

## Code

```javascript
function minimizeArray(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    const isValid = (maxVal) => {
        let total = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            total += nums[i];
            if (total > (i + 1) * maxVal) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    let left = Math.floor(nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / n);
    let right = Math.max(...nums);

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (isValid(mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [10, 20, 30];
console.log(minimizeArray(nums));  // Output: 15
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(\text{max}(\text{nums})))\)
- **Validity Check in each step**: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log(\text{max}(\text{nums})))\).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a few extra variables.
