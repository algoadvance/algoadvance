[Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l206)
### Problem Statement
You are given the head of a singly linked list. You need to reverse the list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Constraints:**
1. The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
2. -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input list be empty?
   - Yes, the problem constraints mention that the number of nodes can be zero.
2. Are there any constraints on the type of values or structure of the nodes, other than those specified?
   - Each node contains an integer value, and the structure is a standard singly linked list.

### Strategy
To reverse a singly linked list, we will iterate through the list and reverse the pointers of each node. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize three pointers: `prev` as `null`, `current` as `head`, and `next` as `null`.
2. Iterate through the list until `current` becomes `null`.
3. For each node, perform the following:
   - Store the next node in `next`.
   - Reverse the current node's next pointer to point to `prev`.
   - Move the `prev` and `current` pointers one step forward.
4. After the loop, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed list.
5. Return `prev`.

### Code
```javascript
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
}

var reverseList = function(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let current = head;
    let next = null;
    
    while (current !== null) {
        next = current.next; // store next node
        current.next = prev; // reverse the link
        prev = current;      // move prev and current one step forward
        current = next;
    }
    
    return prev; // prev becomes the new head
};

// Helper function to create linked list from array
function createLinkedList(arr) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    let current = dummy;
    for (let val of arr) {
        current.next = new ListNode(val);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}

// Helper function to print linked list
function printLinkedList(head) {
    let current = head;
    let result = [];
    while (current !== null) {
        result.push(current.val);
        current = current.next;
    }
    console.log(result);
}

// Example usage:
let head = createLinkedList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
let reversedHead = reverseList(head);
printLinkedList(reversedHead);  // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we need to visit each node exactly once to reverse the pointers.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity for this solution is O(1). We are using a fixed amount of extra space (three pointers) regardless of the input size. Hence, the space complexity is constant.
