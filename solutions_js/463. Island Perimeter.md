[Leetcode 463. Island Perimeter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l463)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `rows x cols` binary matrix representing a map where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside the island is not connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with a side length of `1`. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: 
grid = [
  [0,1,0,0],
  [1,1,1,0],
  [0,1,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0]
]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 edges around the land cells.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that there is exactly one island?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees exactly one island.
   
2. Are the input dimensions always valid (rows and cols always greater than 0)?
   - Yes, input dimensions are valid and greater than 0.

3. Can the grid contain any other value except `1` and `0`?
   - No, the grid only contains `1` (land) and `0` (water).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, I'll iterate over each cell in the grid. When I find a land cell (`1`), I'll check its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right):

- If the neighboring cell is out of grid bounds or contains `0` (water), it contributes to the perimeter.
- I'll keep a running total of these contributions to calculate the overall perimeter of the island.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution will be `O(rows * cols)` because we need to look at each cell in the grid exactly once.

## Code

```javascript
function islandPerimeter(grid) {
    let perimeter = 0;
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    // Helper function to determine if a given cell contributes to the perimeter
    function isWaterOrBoundary(r, c) {
        return r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === 0;
    }

    // Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 1) { // Land cell
                // Check all four directions
                if (isWaterOrBoundary(r - 1, c)) perimeter++; // Up
                if (isWaterOrBoundary(r + 1, c)) perimeter++; // Down
                if (isWaterOrBoundary(r, c - 1)) perimeter++; // Left
                if (isWaterOrBoundary(r, c + 1)) perimeter++; // Right
            }
        }
    }

    return perimeter;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0]
];
console.log(islandPerimeter(grid)); // Output: 16
```

This code defines a function `islandPerimeter`, which calculates the perimeter of the island in the given binary matrix. It uses a helper function `isWaterOrBoundary` to check if a neighbor contributes to the perimeter, iterating through each cell to get the final result.
