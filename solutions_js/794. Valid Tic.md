[Leetcode 794. Valid Tic](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l794)
## Problem Statement

You are given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a list of strings `board` where `board[i]` is a string representing the `i-th` row of the board. The characters in the string are either `"X"`, `"O"`, or `" "`, representing empty cells. You need to determine if the board state is valid.

The board is valid if:
1. It is the result of a sequence of valid moves from an empty board.
2. The number of `X`s and `O`s on the board are such that `X` goes first, and players alternate turns.

More formally, the board is valid if:
- The number of `X`s is either equal to or one more than the number of `O`s.
- `O` must not have more turns than `X`.
- There must not be a winning line of `X` if `O`'s count is equal to `X`'s count.
- There must not be a winning line of `O` if `X`'s count is one more than `O`'s count.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Board Size**: Can I assume the board is always 3x3?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees a standard Tic-Tac-Toe board size of 3x3.
2. **Input format**: What is the format of the input?
   - The input is an array of three strings, each string representing one row of the board.
3. **Character Assumptions**: Can I assume only valid characters `"X"`, `"O"`, and `" "`?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees only these characters in the input strings.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the 'X' and 'O'**: Count the number of 'X' and 'O' characters on the board.
2. **Check Valid Number of Moves**: Ensure the count of 'X' is either equal to or one more than the count of 'O'.
3. **Check Winning Conditions**:
   - Define a helper function to check if there's a winning line for 'X' or 'O'.
   - Ensure no invalid winning combination scenarios:
       - 'X' winning while 'X' count is equal to 'O' count.
       - 'O' winning while 'X' count is one more than 'O' count.

## Code

```javascript
const validTicTacToe = (board) => {
    // Function to check if a player has won
    const checkWin = (player) => {
        // Check rows, columns and diagonals for a win
        for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] === player && board[i][1] === player && board[i][2] === player) return true;
            if (board[0][i] === player && board[1][i] === player && board[2][i] === player) return true;
        }
        if (board[0][0] === player && board[1][1] === player && board[2][2] === player) return true;
        if (board[0][2] === player && board[1][1] === player && board[2][0] === player) return true;
        return false;
    };
    
    let xCount = 0, oCount = 0;
    
    // Count number of 'X' and 'O'
    for (let row of board) {
        for (let char of row) {
            if (char === 'X') xCount++;
            if (char === 'O') oCount++;
        }
    }
    
    // Check the basic validity of counts
    if (oCount > xCount || xCount > oCount + 1) return false;
    
    // Check if 'X' or 'O' has won
    const xWin = checkWin('X');
    const oWin = checkWin('O');
    
    // If both 'X' and 'O' have winning lines, return false
    if (xWin && oWin) return false;

    // If 'X' wins, 'X' must have one more move than 'O'
    if (xWin && xCount !== oCount + 1) return false;

    // If 'O' wins, 'X' must have as many moves as 'O'
    if (oWin && xCount !== oCount) return false;
    
    return true;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(1)` because we are only iterating a constant number of cells (9 cells in a 3x3 grid) and performing constant-time checks for winning conditions.

By following the outlined strategy, we ensure that all criteria for a valid Tic-Tac-Toe board state are met.
