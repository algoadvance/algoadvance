[Leetcode 337. House Robber III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l337)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to decide the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. The houses are represented in a binary tree form. Each node's value represents the amount of money in each house. Adjacent nodes are houses next to each other, and if you rob a node, you cannot rob its immediate children.

**Leetcode description:**

You are given the `root` of a binary tree representing the houses and their respective monetary values. Return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, if the tree is empty, the function should return 0.
   
2. **Can the values in the nodes be negative?**
   - No, since the problem context is about robbing houses, the values should be non-negative integers.

3. **What is the maximum height of the tree?**
   - The height of the tree can vary but is typically bounded by the constraints in a competitive programming environment. Assume reasonable upper limits, as specified by the problem's constraints.

### Strategy

This is a dynamic programming (DP) problem where the state depends on whether you rob a particular house (node) or not. We can solve this efficiently using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization to store the results of subproblems.

#### Steps:
1. **Define a helper function** `robSubtree(node)` which will calculate the maximum money that can be robbed starting from `node`.
2. **Base Case:** If the node is `null`, return `0`.
3. For each node, calculate two scenarios:
   - **Robbing the current node**: This implies not robbing its immediate children.
   - **Not robbing the current node**: This allows robbing its children.
4. Use a dictionary to memoize the results of the subproblems to avoid re-computation.

### Code

Here's the complete JavaScript solution:

```javascript
function rob(root) {
    const memo = new Map();

    function robSubtree(node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        if (memo.has(node)) return memo.get(node);

        // Rob this node
        let robCurrent = node.val;
        if (node.left) {
            robCurrent += robSubtree(node.left.left) + robSubtree(node.left.right);
        }
        if (node.right) {
            robCurrent += robSubtree(node.right.left) + robSubtree(node.right.right);
        }

        // Don't rob this node
        let skipCurrent = robSubtree(node.left) + robSubtree(node.right);

        // Max of robbing or not robbing this node
        const result = Math.max(robCurrent, skipCurrent);
        memo.set(node, result);
        return result;
    }

    return robSubtree(root);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once due to memoization.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \), due to the memoization map storing results for each node and the recursion stack in the worst case of a skewed tree.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and handles large trees effectively.
