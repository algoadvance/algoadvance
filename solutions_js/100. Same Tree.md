[Leetcode 100. Same Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l100)
### Problem Statement

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the nodes?**
   - The values can be any valid integer values.

2. **Can the trees be empty?**
   - Yes, both trees can be empty. Two empty trees are considered the same.

3. **Is there any restriction on the depth or size of the trees?**
   - No specific restrictions are mentioned, so we should assume general binary trees without any constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach:** We can use a recursive function to compare each node. The base conditions are:
    - If both nodes are `null`, they are the same.
    - If one node is `null` and the other isn't, they are not the same.
    - If the values of the current nodes are different, they are not the same.

For the recursive step:
- Recursively check the left subtree.
- Recursively check the right subtree.
- If both the left and right subtrees are the same, the current trees rooted at the given nodes are the same.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSameTree = function(p, q) {
    // Base cases
    if (p === null && q === null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (p === null || q === null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (p.val !== q.val) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Recursive check for left and right subtrees
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the minimum number of nodes in the two trees. In the worst case, each node of both trees is compared exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H) where H is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, the space complexity would be O(N).

This function efficiently checks whether two binary trees are identical by recursively comparing each corresponding node.
