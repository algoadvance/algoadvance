[Leetcode 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2392)
### Problem Statement

Given the dimensions of a matrix along with two arrays of conditions, you need to construct a matrix that satisfies these conditions. Each condition specifies that a particular element should be placed before another element in either the row or column of the matrix.

Specifically:
- You have an `n x n` matrix.
- There will be two arrays of conditions, `rowConditions` and `colConditions`.
  - `rowConditions[i] = [a, b]` means that element `a` should be placed in a row before element `b`.
  - `colConditions[i] = [a, b]` means that element `a` should be placed in a column before element `b`.

Your task is to build the matrix that satisfies all given conditions if possible. Otherwise, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of values**: What are the valid ranges of values for the elements in the matrix?
2. **Input constraints**: Are there any constraints on the maximum size of the matrix \( n \) or the size of the conditions arrays?
3. **Duplication**: Are there any duplicated values in the conditions array or row?

### Strategy

1. **Topological Sort**: Given that we need to maintain a specific order for the rows and columns, this suggests we need to use topological sorting to determine the correct order.
   - We will use Kahn's algorithm or a Depth-First Search (DFS)-based approach to perform the topological sort.
   - We'll handle `rowConditions` to determine the order within rows.
   - We'll handle `colConditions` to determine the order within columns.

2. **Validation**: 
   - If it's not possible to satisfy the ordering conditions, the topological sort will fail, and we return an empty array.
   - If we successfully determine the order for rows and columns, we can then construct the matrix accordingly.

3. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Once we have the topological order for the rows and columns, we can place the elements in the matrix accordingly.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript implementation for the problem:

```javascript
function buildMatrix(n, rowConditions, colConditions) {
    // Helper function to perform topological sort
    function topologicalSort(n, conditions) {
        let inDegree = Array(n).fill(0);
        let graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);

        // Create the adjacency list and in-degree array
        for (const [u, v] of conditions) {
            graph[u - 1].push(v - 1);
            inDegree[v - 1]++;
        }

        let stack = [];
        
        // Add all nodes with in-degree 0 to the stack
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] === 0) stack.push(i);
        }

        let topologicalOrder = [];

        while (stack.length > 0) {
            let u = stack.pop();
            topologicalOrder.push(u);

            for (const v of graph[u]) {
                inDegree[v]--;
                if (inDegree[v] === 0) stack.push(v);
            }
        }

        // If we have not processed all nodes, return null (cycle detected)
        return topologicalOrder.length === n ? topologicalOrder : null;
    }

    // Find the topological order for rows and columns
    const rowOrder = topologicalSort(n, rowConditions);
    if (!rowOrder) return []; // No valid topological ordering for rows

    const colOrder = topologicalSort(n, colConditions);
    if (!colOrder) return []; // No valid topological ordering for columns

    // Map the topological orders to the actual positions
    const rowPosition = new Array(n);
    const colPosition = new Array(n);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        rowPosition[rowOrder[i]] = i;
        colPosition[colOrder[i]] = i;
    }

    // Construct the matrix
    const matrix = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        matrix[rowPosition[i]][colPosition[i]] = i + 1;
    }

    return matrix;
}
```

### Strategy and Time Complexity

1. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Build the adjacency list in \( O(E) \) time where \( E \) is the number of conditions.
   - Perform topological sorting in \( O(V + E) \) time where \( V \) is the number of elements (or nodes).

2. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Mapping the orders and constructing the matrix requires \( O(n) \) time as we process each element a constant number of times.

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of this approach is:
\[ O(n + k) \]
Where \( n \) is the number of elements in the matrix, and \( k \) is the number of conditions in rowConditions and colConditions. This efficiently handles creating the matrix per the given constraints and conditions.
