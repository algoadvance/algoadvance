[Leetcode 1360. Number of Days Between Two Dates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1360)
### Problem Statement
The problem requires calculating the number of days between two dates. Each date will be in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

**Example:**
- Input: date1 = "2019-06-29", date2 = "2019-06-30"
- Output: 1

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Validation:** Should we always assume the input dates are in the correct format `"YYYY-MM-DD"` and are valid calendar dates?
2. **Output Type:** Is the function supposed to return the absolute difference in days (i.e., it should not matter which date is earlier)?
3. **Edge Cases:** Should we consider the possibility of very long date ranges, including calculations across multiple years and centuries?

### Strategy
1. **Convert String to Date:** First, convert the date strings to JavaScript `Date` objects.
2. **Calculate Time Difference:** Use the `getTime()` method to get the difference in milliseconds between the two dates.
3. **Convert Milliseconds to Days:** Convert the millisecond difference to days by dividing by the number of milliseconds in one day.
4. **Return Absolute Difference:** Ensure the output is always a non-negative number since we're looking for the absolute number of days between the two dates.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} date1
 * @param {string} date2
 * @return {number}
 */
function daysBetweenDates(date1, date2) {
    // Convert the date strings to Date objects
    const d1 = new Date(date1);
    const d2 = new Date(date2);
    
    // Calculate the time difference in milliseconds
    const timeDifference = Math.abs(d2 - d1);
    
    // Calculate the number of days (milliseconds in a day: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
    const daysDifference = timeDifference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
    
    return daysDifference;
}

// Test cases
console.log(daysBetweenDates("2019-06-29", "2019-06-30")); // Output: 1
console.log(daysBetweenDates("2020-01-15", "2019-12-31")); // Output: 15
console.log(daysBetweenDates("2000-01-01", "2020-01-01")); // Output: 7305
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) - Converting string dates to `Date` objects and calculating the difference are constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

This solution ensures that we handle both dates correctly and calculate the absolute number of days between them efficiently.
