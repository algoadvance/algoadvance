[Leetcode 1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1156)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `text`. You can swap two characters from `text` to create a new string. Return the length of the longest possible substring consisting of one character that can be obtained by this process.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the swapped characters be non-adjacent?**
   - Yes, the two characters to swap can be at any position in the string.
  
2. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, we assume that the string will be non-empty based on the problem statement.
  
3. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string?**
   - No, the string can contain any characters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we should:
1. Identify the longest "blocks" (consecutive same characters) in the string.
2. Analyze the blocks and see if swapping characters can extend one of these blocks.
3. Keep track of the count of each character to determine potential swaps to extend the blocks.

Steps:
1. Traverse the string to count the occurrence of each character.
2. Create a list of blocks where each block is represented as `[char, length, start_index]`.
3. For each block:
   - Check the length of the block.
   - Look at adjacent blocks and consider merging them if they are separated by one different character, provided there are more characters of the same type that can be swapped.
4. Track the maximum length after possible swaps.

### Code

```javascript
function maxRepOpt1(text) {
    const n = text.length;
    const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const blocks = [];

    for (const char of text) {
        count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    let i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        let j = i;
        while (j < n && text[j] === text[i]) {
            j++;
        }
        blocks.push([text[i], j - i, i]);
        i = j;
    }

    let maxLen = 0;

    for (let k = 0; k < blocks.length; k++) {
        const [char, len, start] = blocks[k];

        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len);

        if (count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] > len) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, len + 1);
        }

        if (k > 0 && k < blocks.length - 1) {
            const [prevChar, prevLen] = blocks[k - 1];
            const [nextChar, nextLen] = blocks[k + 1];

            if (prevChar === nextChar && prevChar === char && blocks[k].length === 1) {
                if (count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)] > prevLen + nextLen) {
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, prevLen + nextLen + 1);
                } else {
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, prevLen + nextLen);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string:
- Counting the occurrences of each character takes \(O(n)\).
- Constructing the list of blocks takes \(O(n)\).
- Analyzing each block and determining the maximum possible length of the repeated substring involves iterating through the blocks list, which is also \(O(n)\).

Thus, the solution efficiently solves the problem within linear time complexity.
