[Leetcode 432. All O`one Data Structure](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l432)
### Problem Statement

Design a data structure to store a specific set of integers, write functions to:
- Increment the count of an integer key.
- Decrement the count of an integer key.
- Return the key with the highest count.
- Return the key with the lowest count.

This needs to be achieved in constant time for each function.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the data structure contain negative integers or only positive integers?**
   - It can contain both.

2. **What should happen if you decrement a count of an integer that is only present once?**
   - The integer should be removed from the data structure.

3. **In case of ties (multiple keys with the same highest or lowest count), can we return any one of them?**
   - Yes, any one of the highest or lowest keys is acceptable.

### Strategy

To meet the requirements of constant time complexity for each function, we can use a combination of:
- **HashMap (`keyCount`)**: To store the count of each key.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node will store keys with the same count.
- **HashMap (`countNodes`)**: To store references to nodes in the doubly linked list, indexed by count.

#### Core Idea:
1. **Increment**:
    - Update the count of the key in `keyCount`.
    - Move the key to the appropriate node in the doubly linked list.
    
2. **Decrement**:
    - Update the count of the key in `keyCount`.
    - Remove the key if its count becomes zero.
    - Move the key to the appropriate node in the doubly linked list.
    
3. **Get Max/Min**:
    - The head and tail of the doubly linked list will maintain the nodes with the minimum and maximum counts, enabling O(1) access.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(count) {
        this.count = count;
        this.keys = new Set();
        this.prev = this.next = null;
    }
}

class AllOne {
    constructor() {
        this.keyCount = new Map();
        this.countNodes = new Map();
        this.head = new Node(-Infinity);
        this.tail = new Node(Infinity);
        this.head.next = this.tail;
        this.tail.prev = this.head;
    }
    
    _addNode(prev, newNode) {
        newNode.next = prev.next;
        newNode.prev = prev;
        prev.next.prev = newNode;
        prev.next = newNode;
    }
    
    _removeNode(node) {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
        this.countNodes.delete(node.count);
    }
    
    _moveKey(key, count, fromNode, toNode) {
        if (fromNode) {
            fromNode.keys.delete(key);
            if (fromNode.keys.size === 0) this._removeNode(fromNode);
        }
        if (!toNode.keys.size) this._addNode(fromNode || this.head, toNode);
        toNode.keys.add(key);
    }
    
    inc(key) {
        let count = this.keyCount.get(key) || 0;
        this.keyCount.set(key, count + 1);
        let fromNode = this.countNodes.get(count);
        let toNode = this.countNodes.get(count + 1) || new Node(count + 1);
        this.countNodes.set(count + 1, toNode);
        this._moveKey(key, count, fromNode, toNode);
    }
    
    dec(key) {
        let count = this.keyCount.get(key);
        if (!count) return;
        if (count === 1) this.keyCount.delete(key);
        else this.keyCount.set(key, count - 1);
        let fromNode = this.countNodes.get(count);
        let toNode = count === 1 ? null : this.countNodes.get(count - 1) || new Node(count - 1);
        if (toNode) this.countNodes.set(count - 1, toNode);
        this._moveKey(key, count, fromNode, toNode);
    }
    
    getMaxKey() {
        if (this.tail.prev === this.head) return "";
        return [...this.tail.prev.keys][0];
    }
    
    getMinKey() {
        if (this.head.next === this.tail) return "";
        return [...this.head.next.keys][0];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Increment**: O(1)
- **Decrement**: O(1)
- **Get Max Key**: O(1)
- **Get Min Key**: O(1)

This ensures that all operations are performed in constant time, as required.
