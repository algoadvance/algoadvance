[Leetcode 799. Champagne Tower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l799)
### Problem Statement
We are given a stack of champagne glasses arranged in the shape of a pyramid. In this pyramid, the glass at the top is indexed at (0, 0), the two glasses below it are indexed at (1, 0) and (1, 1), and so on until the bottom row. When poured into the top glass, the champagne flows in such a way that after filling a glass, any excess champagne spills equally to the two glasses below.

Given an integer `poured`, denoting the number of cups of champagne poured into the top glass, return how full the glass at position `(query_row, query_glass)` is. Both `query_row` and `query_glass` are 0-indexed. A glass is said to be full if it has 1 cup of champagne in it. If the amount of champagne is greater than or equal to 1, it just remains full.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What happens if we pour an exceedingly large amount of champagne?** 
   - We need to calculate up to the row specified by the `query_row` and `query_glass` and ignore the rest.
2. **What is the maximum number of rows we might deal with?**
   - Typically, problems like these are bounded to around a few hundred rows, but we will ensure our solution works within practical constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Create a Data Structure:** Use a 2D array to simulate filling the glasses. Each element `(i, j)` of this array represents the amount of champagne in the glass at row `i` and column `j`.
2. **Simulate Pouring Champagne:** Start with pouring the champagne into the first glass. For each glass, if it overflows, split the excess champagne equally between the glass directly below to its left and right.
3. **Calculate the Result:** At the end of the pouring process, the answer for a glass at `(query_row, query_glass)` is simply the amount in that glass, capped at 1 since a glass cannot hold more than 1 cup of champagne.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation based on the strategy described:

```javascript
function champagneTower(poured, query_row, query_glass) {
    // Create a 2D array initialized to 0 of sufficient size to cover the required row
    const tower = Array.from({ length: query_row + 1 }, () => Array(query_row + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Start by pouring all champagne into the top glass
    tower[0][0] = poured;
    
    // Iterate over each row
    for (let row = 0; row < query_row; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col <= row; col++) {
            if (tower[row][col] > 1) {
                const overflow = (tower[row][col] - 1) / 2;
                tower[row][col] = 1;  // Cap current glass to hold max 1 cup
                tower[row + 1][col] += overflow;       // Spread overflow to the left-bottom glass
                tower[row + 1][col + 1] += overflow;   // Spread overflow to the right-bottom glass
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The glass at (query_row, query_glass) should be capped at 1
    return Math.min(1, tower[query_row][query_glass]);
}

// Example usage
const poured = 10;
const query_row = 3;
const query_glass = 2;
console.log(champagneTower(poured, query_row, query_glass)); // Output should be the fill level of the specified glass
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(r^2)\) where \(r\) is the `query_row`. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, we need to process each glass up to the row `r` and each glass in that row can receive contributions from the previous rows. The space complexity is also \(O(r^2)\) due to the storage used for the `tower` array. This should work efficiently within typical problem constraints.
