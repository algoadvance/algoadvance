[Leetcode 2309. Greatest English Letter in Upper and Lower Case](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2309)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of English letters (both upper and lower case), return the greatest English letter which exists in both lower and upper cases within the string. The returned letter should be in uppercase. If no such letter exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the input string `s` non-empty?
     - No. You might have an empty input string.
   - Can the string contain non-alphabetic characters?
     - No. The string contains only English letters.
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Always return the result in uppercase.
   - If no such letter exists, return an empty string.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Sets**: Create two sets, `upper_set` and `lower_set`, to store seen characters.
2. **Loop Through the String**: Iterate through each character in the string.
   - If the character is uppercase, add it to `upper_set`.
   - If the character is lowercase, add it to `lower_set`.
3. **Find the Greatest Letter**: Initialize a variable `greatest_letter` to keep track of the highest letter found.
   - Iterate over the possible uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'.
   - Check if both the uppercase and lowercase versions of the letter are in their respective sets.
   - If found, update `greatest_letter` accordingly.
4. **Return Result**: After iterating through all characters, return the greatest letter found or an empty string if no letter meets the criteria.

### Code

```javascript
function greatestLetter(s) {
    let upper_set = new Set();
    let lower_set = new Set();
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z') {
            upper_set.add(char);
        } else if (char >= 'a' && char <= 'z') {
            lower_set.add(char);
        }
    }
    
    let greatest_letter = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        let upper = String.fromCharCode(65 + i);
        let lower = String.fromCharCode(97 + i);
        if (upper_set.has(upper) && lower_set.has(lower)) {
            greatest_letter = upper;
        }
    }
    
    return greatest_letter;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n + 26)` where:
- `n` is the length of the input string `s` (for iterating through the string).
- `26` is a constant representing the fixed size of the English alphabet (for checking each letter).

Since 26 is a constant, the overall time complexity simplifies to `O(n)`, which is efficient for this problem. The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the sets regardless of the input size.
