[Leetcode 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1819)
## Problem Statement
Leetcode problem 1819: "Number of Different Subsequences GCDs"

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return the number of different GCDs that can be obtained of any non-empty subsequence of `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the numbers in `nums`?**
   - The numbers in `nums` are positive integers up to 2 * 10^5.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` is up to 2 * 10^5.
   
3. **What is a subsequence?**
   - A subsequence of an array is derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
   
4. **What is the GCD of a subsequence?**
   - The GCD of a subsequence is the Greatest Common Divisor of all the numbers in that subsequence.

## Strategy to Solve the Problem
1. **Key Insights:**
   - We need to find different GCD values for any subsequence.
   - Rather than generating all subsequences (which is computationally infeasible), we can count the number of unique GCD values using a different approach.

2. **Approach:**
   - Consider every integer from 1 to the maximum number in `nums` (denoted as `max_num`).
   - For each potential GCD value `x`, check whether there exists a subsequence whose GCD is `x`.
   - To find such a subsequence for a number `x`, check all multiples of `x` in `nums`.

3. **Steps:**
   - Iterate through each number `x` from 1 to `max_num`.
   - Use an array to keep track of the counts of all numbers in `nums`.
   - For each integer `x`, iterate through its multiples and check if there are elements in the array that can form the GCD `x`.

## Code

```javascript
function countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(nums) {
    const maxNum = 200000;
    const count = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(false);
    
    // Mark the counts for the occurrence of each number in nums
    for (const num of nums) {
        count[num] = true;
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    
    // Check every number from 1 to maxNum
    for (let x = 1; x <= maxNum; x++) {
        let gcd = 0;
        
        for (let multiple = x; multiple <= maxNum; multiple += x) {
            if (count[multiple]) {
                gcd = gcdHelper(gcd, multiple);
            }
            
            if (gcd === x) {
                result++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

function gcdHelper(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
}

// Example Usage
let nums = [6, 10, 3];
console.log(countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(nums)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
- **Pre-processing**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`, to mark the occurrence of each number in the `count` array.
- **Main computation**: O(max_num * log(max_num)), for iterating through each potential GCD value and its multiples and computing the GCD.
- **Overall**: The time complexity is O(n + max_num * log(max_num)), where `max_num` is 200,000 in the worst case. This is feasible given the constraints.
