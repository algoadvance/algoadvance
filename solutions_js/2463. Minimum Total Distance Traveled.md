[Leetcode 2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2463)
## Problem Statement

**2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled**

You are given an array of `robots` where `robots[i]` is the position of the `i-th` robot, and an array of `factories` where `factories[j]` is the position of the `j-th` factory. The goal is to assign each robot to a factory such that the total distance traveled by all robots is minimized. The distance traveled by a robot is the absolute difference between its position and its assigned factory's position. Each factory can be assigned to at most one robot.

Return the minimum total distance traveled by all robots.

### Example

**Input:**
```js
robots = [1, 3, 5]
factories = [2, 4, 8]
```

**Output:**
```js
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Assign robot 1 to factory 2, distance = abs(1 - 2) = 1
- Assign robot 3 to factory 4, distance = abs(3 - 4) = 1
- Assign robot 5 to factory 8, distance = abs(5 - 8) = 3
- Total distance = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we have duplicate positions in the `robots` or `factories` arrays?
2. Are `robots` and `factories` guaranteed to be non-empty?
3. Is each robot guaranteed to have at least one factory to be assigned to?
4. Are there any constraints on the length of the arrays?

## Strategy

Hereâ€™s a strategy to solve this:

1. **Sort the Arrays**: By sorting both `robots` and `factories`, we can easily assign robots to the nearest available factory.
2. **Greedy Assignment**: Since we want to minimize the total distance, a greedy approach ensures we always assign the current robot to the nearest unassigned factory.

Assuming:
- `robots` has a length of `n`
- `factories` has a length of `m`

1. Sort both arrays.
2. Initialize two pointers: one for `robots` and one for `factories`.
3. Iterate through the `robots` array and assign each robot to the nearest available factory, updating total distance accordingly.

## Code

```js
function minTotalDistance(robots, factories) {
    // Step 1: Sort both arrays
    robots.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    factories.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let totalDistance = 0;
    let factoryIndex = 0;

    // Step 2: Iterate through each robot
    for (let i = 0; i < robots.length; i++) {
        // Find the nearest unassigned factory
        while (factoryIndex < factories.length && factories[factoryIndex] < robots[i]) {
            factoryIndex++;
        }
        
        // Calculate the distance and add it to the total distance
        totalDistance += Math.abs(robots[i] - factories[factoryIndex]);

        // Move factoryIndex to the next factory for the next robot
        factoryIndex++;
    }
    
    return totalDistance;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. Sorting both `robots` and `factories` - `O(n log n + m log m)`.
2. Single pass over the `robots` array - `O(n)`.

The overall time complexity is `O(n log n + m log m)` where `n` is the length of `robots` and `m` is the length of `factories`.
