[Leetcode 228. Summary Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l228)
## Problem Statement

You are given a sorted unique integer array `nums`.

A range `[a,b]` is the smallest interval such that every number in the interval `a <= x <= b` is included in the array.

Find the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `a <= x <= b` is not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:
- `"a->b"` if `a != b`
- `"a"` if `a == b`

### Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What happens if the input array is empty?**
   - A: The output should be an empty list.

2. **Q: Are the elements in the input array guaranteed to be sorted and unique?**
   - A: Yes, the problem statement guarantees that the elements are sorted and unique.

3. **Q: What is the maximum length of the input array?**
   - A: According to the problem's usual constraints, it can go up to \(10^4\).

## Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list to store the ranges.
2. Use a variable to track the start of the current range.
3. Iterate over the array.
   - If the current element is not consecutive to the previous one, close the current range and start a new one.
   - If the current element is the last element in the array, make sure to close the final range.
4. Append ranges to the result list in the required format.
5. Return the result list.

## Code

```javascript
function summaryRanges(nums) {
    let ranges = [];
    let i = 0;
    
    while (i < nums.length) {
        let start = nums[i];
        
        while (i < nums.length - 1 && nums[i] + 1 === nums[i + 1]) {
            i++;
        }
        
        let end = nums[i];
        
        if (start === end) {
            ranges.push(`${start}`);
        } else {
            ranges.push(`${start}->${end}`);
        }
        
        i++;
    }
    
    return ranges;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. We iterate through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for the extra space used, excluding the space used to store the output.

This achieves an optimal and efficient solution for the problem.
