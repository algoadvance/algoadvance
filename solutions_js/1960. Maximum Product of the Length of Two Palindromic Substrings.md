[Leetcode 1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1960)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, you need to find the maximum possible product of the lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings of `s`. The two substrings must be palindromes and cannot overlap.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What defines non-overlapping substrings?**
   - They do not share any characters. If one substring ends at index `i`, the other must start after `i`.

2. **Can the palindromic substrings be adjacent?**
   - Yes, as long as they do not overlap.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `s` will always have at least two palindromic substrings?**
   - Yes, since any single character is a palindrome by itself, there is always at least one palindromic substring.

## Strategy
### Steps to Solve
1. **Identify Palindromes**
   - Determine all possible palindromic substrings in `s`.
   - Use dynamic programming to identify and store the maximum palindrome length ending and starting at each position.

2. **Compute Non-Overlapping Palindromes**
   - Use the information to compute two arrays: 
     - `leftP[i]` is the length of the longest palindromic substring ending at or before `i`.
     - `rightP[i]` is the length of the longest palindromic substring starting at or after `i`.

3. **Compute the Maximum Product**
   - Iterate through the string and find the maximum product of lengths of non-overlapping palindromic substrings using the `leftP` and `rightP` arrays.

### Code
```javascript
function maxProduct(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const leftP = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const rightP = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Helper function to find maximum palindromic lengths
    function maxPalindrome(s, leftP, rightP) {
        const n = s.length;
        // Dynamic programming table
        const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
        
        for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) dp[i][i] = true;

        for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (s[i] === s[i + 1]) {
                dp[i][i + 1] = true;
            }
        }

        for (let length = 3; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                const j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] === s[j] && dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Fill leftP array
        for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (let j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
                if (dp[j][i]) {
                    leftP[i] = Math.max(leftP[i], i - j + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Fill rightP array
        for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (let j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dp[i][j]) {
                    rightP[i] = Math.max(rightP[i], j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    maxPalindrome(s, leftP, rightP);

    // Calculate leftP and rightP's max values for comparison
    for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        leftP[i] = Math.max(leftP[i], leftP[i - 1]);
    }
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        rightP[i] = Math.max(rightP[i], rightP[i + 1])
    }

    // Calculate the maximum product of lengths
    let maxProduct = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, leftP[i] * rightP[i + 1]);
    }

    return maxProduct;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxProduct("acdapmpomp")); // Output: 15
console.log(maxProduct("ababbb")); // Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This accounts for the dynamic programming table creation and the subsequent array updates necessary to compute the `leftP` and `rightP` values.

By methodically building the solution, complexity is kept within efficient bounds for most practical input sizes typically found in coding interviews.
