[Leetcode 786. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l786)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of integers `arr` of length `n` where all elements are distinct and greater than 1. We need to find the `k`-th smallest prime fraction where a prime fraction is defined as `arr[i] / arr[j]` and `0 <= i < j < n`.

- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]`, `k = 3`
- Output: `[2, 5]`

In this example, the prime fractions in sorted order are:
- `1/5 = 0.2`
- `1/3 ≈ 0.3333`
- `2/5 = 0.4`
- `1/2 = 0.5`
- `3/5 = 0.6`
- `2/3 ≈ 0.6667`

So, the 3rd smallest fraction is `[2, 5]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the array guaranteed to contain distinct elements?
2. Can primes greater than 5 be assumed to exist in the provided array?
3. Should the output be given in the form of a 2-element array `[numerator, denominator]`?
4. What is the range of input size `n`? This will help us determine the appropriateness of different approaches.

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem efficiently can be divided into the following steps:

1. **Understanding Prime Fractions:** We need to find fractions such that `arr[i] / arr[j]` where `i < j`.
2. **Heap (or Priority Queue):** We can use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest fractions encountered. The heap will help keep the process of fetching the smallest element efficient.
3. **Binary Search:** Alternatively, binary search can efficiently narrow down to the `k`-th smallest fraction without generating all possible fractions.

### Solution using Binary Search and Two Pointers

We'll use binary search on the value of the fraction to find the `k`-th smallest fraction. The steps are as follows:

1. Use a binary search where the range of values is between `0` and `1`.
2. For each mid value (`mid`), count how many fractions are less than or equal to `mid` using two pointers technique.
3. Adjust the binary search range based on the count of fractions found.
4. Keep track of the exact fraction that we encountered during the process which corresponds to the `k`-th smallest fraction.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function kthSmallestPrimeFraction(arr, k) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let low = 0.0, high = 1.0;

    while (low < high) {
        let mid = (low + high) / 2;
        let count = 0;
        let maxFraction = [0, 1]; // Numerator and denominator
        let i = -1;

        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) { // Denominator index
            while (i + 1 < j && arr[i + 1] / arr[j] < mid) {
                i++;
            }

            count += (i + 1);
            if (i >= 0 && arr[i] / arr[j] > maxFraction[0] / maxFraction[1]) {
                maxFraction = [arr[i], arr[j]];
            }
        }

        if (count == k) {
            return maxFraction;
        } else if (count < k) {
            low = mid;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }

    // In case of no exact match (shouldn't happen according to problem constraints)
    return [];
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in `O(log (1/epsilon))`, where `epsilon` is the precision to which we compute the fractions.
2. **Counting Fractions:** Each counting process (two-pointer method) runs in `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log (1/epsilon))`.

This makes the solution efficient even for relatively large values of `n`.
