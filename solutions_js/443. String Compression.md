[Leetcode 443. String Compression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l443)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of characters `chars`, where each character represents a single character. Implement a function that performs run-length encoding on this list of characters. The compressed list should replace sequences of repeated characters with the character followed by the number of repetitions. The length of the compressed list should be the new length of the array.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]`
- Output: `6`, 
- Explanation: The array should be modified to `["a", "2", "b", "2", "c", "3"]`.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `chars = ["a"]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: The array should be modified to `["a"]`.

**Example 3:**
- Input: `chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: The array should be modified to `["a","b","1","2"]`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`
- `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **In-place modification?**: Do we modify the input array `chars` in place?
   - Yes, the problem specifies that the array should be modified in place.
   
2. **Return Value**: Should the function return anything specific?
   - Return the length of the modified array.

3. **Handling Single Characters**: How do we handle single characters with no repeats?
   - Single characters stay as is without any number following them.

### Strategy
1. **Two Pointer Technique**: Utilize two pointers:
   - One for traversing the original array (`i`).
   - One for building the compressed array (`write`).

2. **Counting Repetitions**: Count how many times each character repeats.
3. **Updating Compressed Array**:
   - Write the character to the `write` index.
   - If the count is more than one, convert the count to a string and write each digit to the array.

4. **Adjust Pointers**: Move the traverse pointer `i` past the current sequence of characters, and update the `write` pointer accordingly.

### Code
```javascript
var compress = function(chars) {
    let write = 0;
    let i = 0;
    
    while (i < chars.length) {
        let char = chars[i];
        let count = 0;
        
        // Count the repetitions of the current character
        while (i < chars.length && chars[i] === char) {
            i++;
            count++;
        }
        
        // Write the character
        chars[write] = char;
        write++;
        
        // If the character count is more than 1, write the count
        if (count > 1) {
            let countStr = count.toString();
            for (let j = 0; j < countStr.length; j++) {
                chars[write] = countStr[j];
                write++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return write;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - We traverse the array once to count characters, and write operations based on the count, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - We use a constant amount of additional space for variables such as indexes and count, making the space complexity O(1).
