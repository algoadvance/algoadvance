[Leetcode 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1967)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`. You need to return the number of strings in `patterns` that appear as substrings in `word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How large can the `patterns` array be?
   - What is the maximum length of any string within `patterns` and the `word`?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - What should be returned if no patterns match any substring in `word`?
   - Should the comparison be case-sensitive?

### Example

Example Input:
```javascript
patterns = ["a", "abc", "bc", "d"]
word = "abc"
```

Example Output:
```javascript
3
```

*Explanation:*
- The patterns `"a"`, `"abc"`, and `"bc"` are substrings of `word` `"abc"`. Hence, the result is `3`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in `patterns` and check if it is a substring of `word`. JavaScript has a built-in string method `.includes` that can be gracefully used for this purpose.

1. Initialize a counter to `0`.
2. Iterate over each pattern in `patterns`.
3. For each pattern, check if it is a substring of `word` using the `.includes` method.
4. If the pattern is a substring, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter after iterating through all patterns.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function numOfStrings(patterns, word) {
    let count = 0;

    for (let pattern of patterns) {
        if (word.includes(pattern)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const patterns = ["a", "abc", "bc", "d"];
const word = "abc";
console.log(numOfStrings(patterns, word));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * m)`, where:
- `n` is the number of strings in the `patterns` array.
- `m` is the average length of the strings within `patterns` and `word`.

`word.includes(pattern)` is `O(m)` where `m` is the length of `word` and `pattern`.

Thus the overall time complexity becomes `O(n * m)`.
