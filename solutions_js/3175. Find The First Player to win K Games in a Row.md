[Leetcode 3175. Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3175)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `players` where `players[i]` and `players[j]` represent two players of a game and `players[i]` has defeated `players[j]`. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to return the name of the first player to win `k` games in a row. If there is no player who wins `k` games in a row, return an empty string.

#### Example
```javascript

Input: players = [["Alan", "Smith"], ["Alan", "Robert"], ["Robert", "Alan"], ["Smith", "Robert"], ["Smith", "Alan"], ["Alan", "Smith"], ["Alan", "Robert"], ["Alan", "Smith"], ["Smith", "Robert"]]
k = 3
Output: "Alan"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the format of the `players` array?
   - The `players` array will consist of sub-arrays where the first element in each sub-array denotes the winner and the second element denotes the loser.

2. What should be done in cases where no player wins `k` games in a row?
   - Return an empty string `" "`.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the `players` array and maintain a counter for consecutive wins of the current leading player.
2. If the current player wins, increment the win counter. If the win counter hits `k`, return the player's name.
3. If a different player wins, reset the win counter and update the leading player.
4. If no player wins `k` consecutive games, return an empty string.

### Code
```javascript
function findFirstPlayerToWinKGames(players, k) {
    if (players.length === 0 || k <= 0) return "";

    let currentStreakPlayer = players[0][0];
    let currentStreakCount = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < players.length; i++) {
        let winner = players[i][0];

        if (winner === currentStreakPlayer) {
            currentStreakCount++;
            if (currentStreakCount === k) {
                return currentStreakPlayer;
            }
        } else {
            currentStreakPlayer = winner;
            currentStreakCount = 1;
        }
    }

    return "";
}

// Example Usage:
const players = [["Alan", "Smith"], ["Alan", "Robert"], ["Robert", "Alan"], 
                 ["Smith", "Robert"], ["Smith", "Alan"], ["Alan", "Smith"], 
                 ["Alan", "Robert"], ["Alan", "Smith"], ["Smith", "Robert"]];
const k = 3;
console.log(findFirstPlayerToWinKGames(players, k)); // Output: "Alan"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of games (length of the `players` array). This is because we are iterating through the `players` array exactly once.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the input is valid (i.e., non-empty and `k` is a positive integer).
- Handle edge cases where the size of the `players` array is less than `k`. Such cases should directly return `""`.
