[Leetcode 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1482)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`. You need to find the minimum number of days for you to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. The garden consists of `n` flowers, where the `i`-th flower will bloom on the `bloomDay[i]`.

In order to make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers (from the left to the right, without skipping any flowers). You can only pick an adjacent group of `k` flowers if all the flowers in the group have bloomed.

Return *the minimum number of days* you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if it's impossible to make `m` bouquets?**
   - Return `-1`.
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of `bloomDay`, `m`, and `k`?**
   - Yes, typically `n`, `m`, and `k` are within reasonable constraints (`1 <= bloomDay.length <= 1e5`), and each value in `bloomDay` is within range `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 1e9`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach to minimize the number of days:

1. **Objective:** Minimize the number of days, `D`.
2. **Lower Bound:** The minimum possible number of days is the smallest value in `bloomDay` (`min(bloomDay)`).
3. **Upper Bound:** The maximum possible number of days is the largest value in `bloomDay` (`max(bloomDay)`).

### Steps:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - Set `low` to `min(bloomDay)`.
   - Set `high` to `max(bloomDay)`.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - While `low <= high`:
     - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
     - Check if it is possible to make `m` bouquets within `mid` days.
     - If possible, move `high` to `mid - 1` to find fewer days.
     - Otherwise, move `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Validation Function:**
   - Check if we can make `m` bouquets in `mid` days:
     - Initialize a counter for bouquets and adjacent flowers.
     - Simulate the days and count consecutive flowers that have bloomed within the `bloomDay`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:** 
   - If `m * k > n`, it is immediately impossible to make the bouquets.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of binary search would be `O(log(max(bloomDay)) * n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
var minDays = function(bloomDay, m, k) {
    const n = bloomDay.length;
    
    // Edge case: Not enough flowers to make bouquets
    if (m * k > n) return -1;

    let low = Math.min(...bloomDay);
    let high = Math.max(...bloomDay);

    const canMakeBouquets = (days) => {
        let bouquets = 0;
        let flowers = 0;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (bloomDay[i] <= days) {
                flowers++;
                if (flowers === k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return bouquets >= m;
    };

    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        
        if (canMakeBouquets(mid)) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return low;
};
```

This code efficiently determines the minimum number of days required to make the desired bouquets by iterating through possible days using binary search and checking feasibility with the `canMakeBouquets` function.
