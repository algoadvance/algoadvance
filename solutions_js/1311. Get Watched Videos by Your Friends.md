[Leetcode 1311. Get Watched Videos by Your Friends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1311)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends`, along with two integers `id` and `level`. 

- `watchedVideos[i]` is a list of all videos watched by the i-th user.
- `friends[i]` is a list of all friends for the i-th user.

You are supposed to find all the videos watched by the friends at the specified friendship level from the given user `id`. The friendship level means the number of friends away from the user. If a friend is 2 steps away, that means the friend's friend.

Return the videos in order of their frequency in increasing order. If there are multiple videos with the same frequency, sort them lexicographically.

### Example
```plaintext
Input:
watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]],
friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]],
id = 0,
level = 1

Output:
["B","C"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size for the `watchedVideos` and `friends` arrays?**
   This affects our choice of algorithm in terms of time complexity.
   
2. **Can a user be friends with themselves?**
   Typically, this should not be the case.

3. **Is it possible to have repeated video entries within watched videos of a user?**
   This affects how we count the frequencies.

4. **Do the input conditions guarantee well-formed input?**
   Assuming so, but the algorithm should still handle unexpected cases gracefully.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for finding friends at the given `level`.
   - Start from the initial user and explore their friends, level by level.
   
2. **Count the frequency of watched videos** from friends found at the specified level.
   - Use a dictionary to track the frequency of each video.

3. **Sort videos first by frequency, then lexicographically**:
   - Convert the frequency dictionary to a list and sort according to the rules.

### Time Complexity

- **BFS Traversal**: O(N + E), where N is the number of users and E is the number of friendships.
- **Video Counting**: O(F) where F is the total length of watched videos by interested friends.
- **Sorting**: O(V log V) where V is the number of distinct videos.

### Code

```javascript
function watchedVideosByFriends(watchedVideos, friends, id, level) {
    let queue = [id];
    let visited = new Set([id]);
    
    // Perform BFS to determine friends at the given level
    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {
        let nextQueue = [];
        for (let friend of queue) {
            for (let nextFriend of friends[friend]) {
                if (!visited.has(nextFriend)) {
                    visited.add(nextFriend);
                    nextQueue.push(nextFriend);
                }
            }
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }
    
    // Count the frequency of each video watched by friends at the given level
    let videoCount = {};
    for (let friend of queue) {
        for (let video of watchedVideos[friend]) {
            if (videoCount[video] === undefined) {
                videoCount[video] = 0;
            }
            videoCount[video]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Convert the video frequency dict to an array and sort it by frequency, then lexicographically
    let sortedVideos = Object.keys(videoCount).sort((a, b) => {
        if (videoCount[a] === videoCount[b]) {
            return a.localeCompare(b);
        }
        return videoCount[a] - videoCount[b];
    });
    
    return sortedVideos;
}
```

This code should solve the problem efficiently and clearly, adhering to the specified constraints and sorting requirements.
