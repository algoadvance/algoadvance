[Leetcode 3080. Mark Elements on Array by Performing Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3080)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`.

For each query `i`, mark every element of `arr` between `left_i` and `right_i` (inclusive). If a previously unmarked element is marked by this query, increment the result by 1.

Return the total number of elements that were marked at least once by the end of all queries.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,0,0,0,0], queries = [[1,3], [0,1], [2,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The array after performing each query is:
- After queries[0] = [1,3]: arr = [0,1,1,1,0]
- After queries[1] = [0,1]: arr = [1,1,1,1,0]
- After queries[2] = [2,4]: arr = [1,1,1,1,1]
Every element was marked by at least one query at the end and the answer is 5.
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an array `marked` of the same length as `arr` to keep track of marked elements.
   - Initialize a variable `countMarked` to 0 to keep track of the number of unique elements marked.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, get the range `[left_i, right_i]`.
   - Traverse the subarray from `left_i` to `right_i`.
   - If an element at index `j` in `arr` was not previously marked (i.e., `marked[j] === false`), mark it and increment the count of marked elements.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all queries, return the total count of marked elements.

## Code

```javascript
function markElements(arr, queries) {
    // Length of the array.
    const n = arr.length;
    
    // Result to count marked elements.
    let countMarked = 0;
    
    // Array to check if an element is marked.
    const marked = new Array(n).fill(false);
    
    // Process each query.
    for (const [left, right] of queries) {
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (!marked[i]) {
                marked[i] = true;
                countMarked++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return countMarked;
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
const queries = [[1, 3], [0, 1], [2, 4]];
console.log(markElements(arr, queries)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
  - Initializing the `marked` array takes \(O(n)\).

- **Processing each query**:
  - For each query, marking elements takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of elements in the specified range.
  - In the worst case, if all queries span the entire array, it results in \(O(n \cdot q)\) where \(q\) is the number of queries.

- **Overall Time Complexity**:
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n + n \cdot q)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \cdot q)\) as \(n\) is a lower order term compared to \(n \cdot q\).

The solution is efficient for moderate values of \(n\) and \(q\). For very large input sizes, this complexity might need optimization.
