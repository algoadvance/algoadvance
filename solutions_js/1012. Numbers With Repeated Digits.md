[Leetcode 1012. Numbers With Repeated Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1012)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `N`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `N` that have at least one repeated digit.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is `N` guaranteed to be a positive integer? Yes.
   - What is the maximum value for `N`? This is not specified in the problem statement but typically we consider values suitable within the language's handling of integers.

2. **Output:**
   - Are we to return only the count of numbers with repeated digits, or do we need to return the actual numbers? We need to return only the count of such numbers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, one efficient strategy is to use combinatorial methods to count the numbers without repeated digits and subtract that from the total count up to `N`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Digit Restriction:**
   - Calculate the total number of integers up to `N`.
   - Calculate the number of integers without repeated digits up to `N`.

2. **Counting Non-Repeated Digit Numbers:**
   - Use combinatorics to count numbers with non-repeated digits.
   - Subtract these from the total count to get the count of numbers with repeated digits.

### Code

Let's write the code to achieve this:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} N
 * @return {number}
 */
const numDupDigitsAtMostN = (N) => {
    const countNonRepeatedDigitNumbers = (n) => {
        let digits = [];
        while (n > 0) {
            digits.push(n % 10);
            n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        }
        const length = digits.length;
        let count = 0;

        // Calculate numbers with less digits
        for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            count += 9 * permutations(9, i - 1);
        }

        // Calculate numbers with the same length
        let seen = new Set();
        for (let i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (let x = (i === length - 1 ? 1 : 0); x < digits[i]; x++) {
                if (!seen.has(x)) {
                    count += permutations(9 - i, i);
                }
            }
            if (seen.has(digits[i])) {
                break;
            }
            seen.add(digits[i]);
            if (i === 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    };

    const permutations = (m, n) => {
        if (n === 0) return 1;
        let result = 1;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result *= (m - i);
        }
        return result;
    };

    return N - countNonRepeatedDigitNumbers(N);
};
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Break down `N` into digits:** This helps us analyze and compare numbers at the digit level.
2. **Permutations Calculation:** This helps in counting numbers without repeated digits by using combinatorics:
    - First, we count numbers with fewer digits.
    - Then, for numbers with the same number of digits as `N`, we ensure the digits do not repeat by using the `seen` set.
3. **Subtract Non-repeated count from `N`** to get the desired count of numbers with repeated digits.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution mainly involves the combinatorial computations and the traversal of the digits:
- Breakdown into digits: `O(log(N))`
- Permutation calculations are limited by the number of digits (which is logarithmic to `N`).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log(N)^2)`

This should be efficient for typical values of `N` up to a very large integer within JavaScript integer limits.
