[Leetcode 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2359)
## Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, `edges[i] == -1`.

You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the maximum distance from the node to either `node1` or `node2` is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no such node exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph contain cycles?** 
   - Yes, the graph can potentially contain cycles, but since each node only has one outgoing edge, there cannot be any cycles involving more than one node.

2. **What is the maximum number of nodes (`n`) that we need to consider?**
   - This is generally constrained by typical competitive programming limits, like `10^4` or `10^5`.

3. **Can `node1` and `node2` be the same?**
   - Yes, the problem statement does not specify any restrictions on `node1` and `node2` being different.

4. **What if both nodes do not have any path to any node?**
   - We return `-1` if no such node exists.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for shortest path:**
    - Perform BFS/DFS starting from `node1` and `node2` to record the shortest distance from each of these nodes to all other nodes.
    
2. **Combine results:**
    - Using the results from BFS/DFS traversals, find the node where the maximum distance to either `node1` or `node2` is minimized.
    
3. **Edge cases handling:**
    - If no nodes are reachable from either `node1` or `node2`, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
function findClosestNode(edges, node1, node2) {
    const n = edges.length;
    
    const bfs = (startNode) => {
        const distances = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
        const queue = [startNode];
        distances[startNode] = 0;
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const node = queue.shift();
            const nextNode = edges[node];
            if (nextNode !== -1 && distances[nextNode] === Infinity) {
                distances[nextNode] = distances[node] + 1;
                queue.push(nextNode);
            }
        }
        
        return distances;
    };
    
    const distFromNode1 = bfs(node1);
    const distFromNode2 = bfs(node2);
    
    let resultNode = -1;
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    
    for (let node = 0; node < n; node++) {
        const maxDist = Math.max(distFromNode1[node], distFromNode2[node]);
        if (maxDist < minDistance) {
            minDistance = maxDist;
            resultNode = node;
        }
    }
    
    return resultNode;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The BFS function runs in O(n) because each node will be processed once.
- Therefore, since we're running BFS twice, the total time complexity is O(2n) which simplifies to O(n).
- Space complexity is O(n) for the distances array.

This completes the problem-solving strategy and implementation for finding the closest node to given two nodes in a directed graph.
