[Leetcode 57. Insert Interval](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l57)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the ith interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of a new interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

### Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

### Constraints:

- 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5
- intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
- newInterval.length == 2
- 0 <= start <= end <= 10^5

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the new interval doesn't overlap with any existing intervals?**
   - We simply insert the new interval into the sorted list of intervals.

2. **What should be done when intervals don't exist (intervals is empty)?**
   - Just return `[newInterval]`.

3. **Are there any specific edge cases to be aware of?**
   - Cases where the new interval is entirely before or after the existing intervals.
   - All intervals are disjoint with the new interval, requiring no merges.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty list to store the merged intervals.
   
2. **Iterate through the given intervals**:
   - For each interval, we compare it with the new interval:
     - If the current interval ends before the new interval starts, add the current interval to the result list.
     - If the current interval starts after the new interval ends, add the new interval to the result list, then add the remaining intervals (since they have no overlap at this point), and return the result.
     - If the current interval overlaps with the new interval, merge them by updating the new interval's start to the minimum start value and the end to the maximum end value.
   
3. **Post-loop addition**: After traversing all intervals, if the new interval has not been added yet, add it to the result list.

4. **Return the result**.

## Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var insert = function(intervals, newInterval) {
    let result = [];
    let i = 0;
    
    // Add all intervals completely before the new interval
    while (i < intervals.length && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
        result.push(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    
    // Merge all overlapping intervals into the new interval
    while (i < intervals.length && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
        newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
        newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
        i++;
    }
    
    // Add the new merged interval
    result.push(newInterval);
    
    // Add all intervals completely after the new interval
    while (i < intervals.length) {
        result.push(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example usages:
// console.log(insert([[1,3],[6,9]], [2,5]));   // Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
// console.log(insert([[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], [4,8])); // Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of intervals in the input array. This is because we are processing each interval in the list once. This solution also requires **O(n)** space to store the resulting intervals.
