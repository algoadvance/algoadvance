[Leetcode 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l235)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
"The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that both nodes p and q are present in the BST?**
   - Yes, you can assume that both nodes are present in the tree.

2. **What kind of values can the nodes contain?**
   - The nodes will contain integer values.

3. **What is the structure of the tree's nodes?**
   - Each node in the tree has the following structure:
     ```javascript
     function TreeNode(val) {
         this.val = val;
         this.left = this.right = null;
     }
     ```

## Strategy

Given the properties of a BST (left subtree values are less than the root, and right subtree values are greater than the root), we can leverage these properties to find the LCA efficiently.

1. Start from the root node.
2. If both `p` and `q` are smaller than the root, then LCA lies in the left subtree.
3. If both `p` and `q` are greater than the root, then LCA lies in the right subtree.
4. If one of `p` or `q` is smaller than the root and the other is greater, then the root itself is the LCA.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    // Start from the root node of the BST
    let currentNode = root;

    // Traverse the tree
    while (currentNode !== null) {
        // If both nodes are lesser than currentNode, move to the left subtree
        if (p.val < currentNode.val && q.val < currentNode.val) {
            currentNode = currentNode.left;
        }
        // If both nodes are greater than currentNode, move to the right subtree
        else if (p.val > currentNode.val && q.val > currentNode.val) {
            currentNode = currentNode.right;
        }
        // If we are here, it means we've found the split point i.e. the LCA node
        else {
            return currentNode;
        }
    }
    
    return null; // This line should never be reached as we assume p and q are in the tree
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this can be O(n) for a skewed tree (like a linked list). However, for a balanced BST, the average time complexity would be O(log n).
