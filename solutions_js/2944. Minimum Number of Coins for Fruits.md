[Leetcode 2944. Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2944)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `coins` representing different coin denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. You need to return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount. If it is not possible to make the amount with the given coin denominations, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the coin denomination array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, coin denominations in the array can be repeated.
   
2. **Can the `amount` be zero or negative?**
   - No, `amount` will be a positive integer as per the problem constraints.

3. **Is there a limit on the size of the `coins` array?**
   - Not explicitly stated, but we can expect it to be reasonably sized for typical programming problems.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 1-dimensional DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of coins needed for the amount `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` because zero coins are needed to make up zero amount.
   - Initialize all other elements of `dp` to `Infinity` (indicating initially that those amounts cannot be made up with any combination of coins).
   - Iterate over each coin and for each coin, iterate over possible amounts from the coin value to the given amount.
   - Update the `dp` array such that for each amount `i`, `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)`.
   - Finally, check the value at `dp[amount]`:
     - If it is `Infinity`, return `-1` (impossible to form the amount).
     - Otherwise, return `dp[amount]` (the minimal number of coins needed to form the amount).

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    let dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;  // base case

    for (let coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }

    return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m)`
  - `n` is the number of coins.
  - `m` is the `amount`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)`
  - As we are using a 1D array of size `amount + 1`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum number of coins required while keeping the algorithm both time and space efficient.
