[Leetcode 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1292)
## Problem Statement

You are given a matrix `mat` of size `m x n` and an integer `threshold`. Return the maximum side length of a square with a sum less than or equal to `threshold` or return 0 if there is no such square.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],
              [1,1,3,2,4,3,2],
              [1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], 
       threshold = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],
              [2,2,2,2,2],
              [2,2,2,2,2],
              [2,2,2,2,2]], 
       threshold = 1
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the matrix `mat`? 
   - The number of rows and columns can be quite large, up to 300 in each dimension.
2. Are all elements in the matrix non-negative integers?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Array:** Use a 2D prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any submatrix.
2. **Binary Search on Side Length:** Use binary search to determine the maximum possible side length of the square whose sum is within the threshold.
3. **Check Sum for a Given Side Length:** For each length determined by the binary search, use the prefix sum array to verify if there exists any sub-square with that side length that satisfies the sum constraint.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Create a prefix sum array where `prefix[i][j]` represents the sum of elements from `mat[0][0]` to `mat[i-1][j-1]`.
2. **Binary Search:**
   - Perform binary search on the side length of the square, ranging from 1 to the smaller dimension of the matrix.
3. **Validate Using the Prefix Sum:**
   - For each candidate side length, check all submatrices using the prefix sum array to verify if their sum is within the threshold.

## Code

```javascript
function maxSideLength(mat, threshold) {
    const m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;
    const prefixSum = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Step 1: Calculate Prefix Sum Array
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            prefixSum[i][j] = mat[i-1][j-1] + prefixSum[i-1][j] + prefixSum[i][j-1] - prefixSum[i-1][j-1];
        }
    }
    
    // Helper function to get the sum of submatrix (r1, c1) to (r2, c2)
    const getSum = (r1, c1, r2, c2) => {
        return prefixSum[r2+1][c2+1] - prefixSum[r1][c2+1] - prefixSum[r2+1][c1] + prefixSum[r1][c1];
    };
    
    // Step 2: Binary Search on the side length
    let left = 0, right = Math.min(m, n), maxLen = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let found = false;
        
        // Check if there exists a square of side length `mid` <= threshold
        for (let i = 0; i + mid - 1 < m; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j + mid - 1 < n; j++) {
                if (getSum(i, j, i + mid - 1, j + mid - 1) <= threshold) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found) break;
        }
        
        if (found) {
            maxLen = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLen;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. Calculating the prefix sum array takes O(m * n) time.
2. Binary search involves O(log(min(m, n))) steps.
3. Each check for a side length involves O(m * n) operations in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is O(m * n * log(min(m, n))).
