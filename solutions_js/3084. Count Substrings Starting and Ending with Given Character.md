[Leetcode 3084. Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3084)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and a character `c`. Write a function to count the number of substrings that start and end with the character `c`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can the character `c` be any character including special characters?
   - Is the string `s` case-sensitive (i.e., does `c` match both uppercase and lowercase)?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return the count as an integer?
  
Let me assume the answers to the questions:
- The maximum length of the string `s` is 10^5.
- The character `c` can be any character.
- The string `s` is case-sensitive.
- Yes, the function should return the count as an integer.

### Strategy

1. **Identify positions of `c`:**
   - Traverse the string to store indexes of character `c`.

2. **Count valid substrings:**
   - For each pair of indexes `(i, j)` where `i <= j`, count the number of substrings that start and end with `c`.
   
### Code

```javascript
function countSubstrings(s, c) {
    let positions = [];
    
    // Step 1: Store index positions of character c in the string s
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === c) {
            positions.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Using the positions list, calculate number of valid substrings
    let count = 0;
    let n = positions.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let s = "abcabc";
let c = "a";
console.log(countSubstrings(s, c));  // Output: 3 ("a", "abcabca", "a")
```

### Time Complexity

- **Storing Positions:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Counting Valid Substrings:** O(p^2) where `p` is the number of positions of `c` found in `s`.

The overall time complexity is O(n + p^2). This should be efficient given the constraints, as the number of occurrences of `c` (represented by `p`) is usually much smaller than `n`.

This approach ensures that we identify the substrings appropriately and count them efficiently.
