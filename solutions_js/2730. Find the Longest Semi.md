[Leetcode 2730. Find the Longest Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2730)
## Problem Statement
Given a string s, find the longest semi-repetitive substring. A semi-repetitive substring is defined as a substring in which no two consecutive characters are the same except at most once. Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - Should we consider only lowercase/uppercase alphabets or any characters?

2. **Output**:
   - Confirm the output should be just the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned when the input string is empty?
   - Are single character strings considered semi-repetitive? If so, their length would be 1.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to find the longest semi-repetitive substring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We maintain two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window of the substring.
   - Initialize a counter (`count`) to keep track of the number of consecutive character repetitions in the current window.
   - Keep a variable `maxLength` to store the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Iterate through the string with the `end` pointer.
   - For each character, check if it is the same as the previous character.
   - If it is the same, increment the counter for consecutive repetitions.
   - If the counter exceeds 1 (i.e., more than one consecutive repetition), move the `start` pointer forward to shrink the window until the counter is at most 1.
   - Update the `maxLength` accordingly.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Directly return 0 for an empty string.
   - If the string has all unique characters, the length of the string itself is the solution.
   
## Code

```javascript
function findLongestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(s) {
    if (s.length === 0) return 0;

    let start = 0;
    let maxLength = 1;
    let repeatCount = 0;

    for (let end = 1; end < s.length; end++) {
        if (s[end] === s[end - 1]) {
            repeatCount++;
        }
        
        while (repeatCount > 1) {
            if (s[start] === s[start + 1]) {
                repeatCount--;
            }
            start++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window with `end` pointer and once when contracting the window with `start` pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a few extra variables and not any data structures that grow with input size.
