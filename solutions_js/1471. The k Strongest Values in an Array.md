[Leetcode 1471. The k Strongest Values in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1471)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - median| > |arr[j] - median|` where `median` is the median of the array. If `|arr[i] - median| == |arr[j] - median|`, then the stronger value is the one that is greater.

Return a list of the `k` strongest values in the array. Return the answer in any arbitrary order.

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is `n`, the median is the `((n - 1) / 2)`-th element, if `n` is odd, or the average of the `((n - 2) / 2)`-th and `((n) / 2)`-th elements if `n` is even.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3, the strength of elements are computed as:
- |1 - 3| = 2
- |2 - 3| = 1
- |3 - 3| = 0
- |4 - 3| = 1
- |5 - 3| = 2
The strongest values are [5, 1]. [5, 2] and [1, 2] are also accepted answers.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: Median is 3, the strength of elements are computed as:
- |1 - 3| = 2
- |1 - 3| = 2
- |3 - 3| = 0
- |5 - 3| = 2
- |5 - 3| = 2
The strongest values are [5, 5]. [5, 1] and [1, 1] are also accepted answers.
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start coding, let's address a few clarifying questions:
1. **Input Range:** What is the range of values for `arr` and `k`?
   - **Answer:** The values of `arr` can be any integer, and `arr` can have a length of `1` to `10^5`. `k` is an integer where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.

2. **Output Order:** Is there a specific order for the output array?
   - **Answer:** No specific order is required for the output as any order is acceptable as long as it contains the `k` strongest values.

3. **Duplicates:** Can `arr` have duplicate values?
   - **Answer:** Yes, `arr` can have duplicate values.

With these clarifications in mind, let's move on to the strategy and coding sections.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Median:**
   - Sort the array.
   - Determine the median using the middle index (consider both cases: even-length and odd-length arrays).

2. **Compute Strengths:**
   - Calculate the strength of each element in the array as `|arr[i] - median|`.

3. **Sort by Strength:**
   - Sort the array by the computed strengths. If the strengths are equal, sort by the element value itself in descending order.

4. **Select Top `k`:**
   - Select the top `k` elements from the sorted list.

### Code

```javascript
function getStrongest(arr, k) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array to find the median
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let n = arr.length;
    let median = arr[Math.floor((n - 1) / 2)];

    // Step 2: Sort the array based on strength and value
    arr.sort((a, b) => {
        let strengthA = Math.abs(a - median);
        let strengthB = Math.abs(b - median);
        
        if (strengthA === strengthB) {
            return b - a; // If strengths are equal, sort by value descending
        }
        return strengthB - strengthA; // Otherwise sort by strength descending
    });

    // Step 3: Return the top k elements
    return arr.slice(0, k);
}

// Example usage
console.log(getStrongest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)); // [5, 1]
console.log(getStrongest([1, 1, 3, 5, 5], 2)); // [5, 5]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Re-sorting by strength:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Slicing the array:** \(O(k)\)

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting operations, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently finds the `k` strongest values in the array while ensuring the program runs within acceptable complexity limits.
