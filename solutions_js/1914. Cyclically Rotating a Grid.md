[Leetcode 1914. Cyclically Rotating a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1914)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. Perform `k` cyclic rotations of grid layers and return the resulting matrix. A cyclic rotation of a layer means that each element in the layer is moved one position clockwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Definition of Grid Layer:** 
   - How are the layers defined for this grid problem?
   - Answer: Layers are defined concentrically, with the outermost elements forming the first layer, the next innermost elements forming the second layer, and so on.

2. **Handling k Greater than Number of Elements in a Layer:**
   - What happens if `k` is larger than the number of elements in a layer?
   - Answer: If `k` exceeds the number of elements, it is implied that we should rotate `k % number_of_elements` times (since a complete cycle gets the layer back to its original state).

3. **Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on `m`, `n`, and `k`?
   - Answer: Typically, matrix dimensions (`m`, `n`) and `k` will be within a manageable range for computation within time limits.

### Strategy

1. **Extract Layers:**
   - Determine the number of layers.
   - Extract each layer into a list.

2. **Rotate Layers:**
   - For each layer, perform a cyclic rotation by k positions. Use modulo operation as necessary to handle larger `k`.

3. **Reconstruct the Grid:**
   - Place the rotated elements back into their appropriate positions in the matrix.

### Code

```javascript
function rotateGrid(grid, k) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const layers = Math.min(m, n) / 2;

    const extractLayer = (layer) => {
        const elements = [];
        // Top row, left to right
        for (let j = layer; j < n - layer; j++) {
            elements.push(grid[layer][j]);
        }
        // Right column, top to bottom
        for (let i = layer + 1; i < m - layer; i++) {
            elements.push(grid[i][n - layer - 1]);
        }
        // Bottom row, right to left
        for (let j = n - layer - 2; j >= layer; j--) {
            elements.push(grid[m - layer - 1][j]);
        }
        // Left column, bottom to top
        for (let i = m - layer - 2; i > layer; i--) {
            elements.push(grid[i][layer]);
        }
        return elements;
    };

    const insertLayer = (layer, elements) => {
        let index = 0;
        // Top row, left to right
        for (let j = layer; j < n - layer; j++) {
            grid[layer][j] = elements[index++];
        }
        // Right column, top to bottom
        for (let i = layer + 1; i < m - layer; i++) {
            grid[i][n - layer - 1] = elements[index++];
        }
        // Bottom row, right to left
        for (let j = n - layer - 2; j >= layer; j--) {
            grid[m - layer - 1][j] = elements[index++];
        }
        // Left column, bottom to top
        for (let i = m - layer - 2; i > layer; i--) {
            grid[i][layer] = elements[index++];
        }
    };

    for (let layer = 0; layer < layers; layer++) {
        const elements = extractLayer(layer);
        const length = elements.length;
        const rotated = elements.slice(k % length).concat(elements.slice(0, k % length));
        insertLayer(layer, rotated);
    }

    return grid;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Extracting Layers:** Each element in the grid is processed once, hence O(m * n).
- **Rotating Layers:** Each layer's rotation cost is linear relative to the layer size, which is bounded by O(m * n) overall.
- **Inserting Layers:** Similar to extraction, O(m * n).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(m * n)**.
