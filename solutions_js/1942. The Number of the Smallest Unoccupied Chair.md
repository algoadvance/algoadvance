[Leetcode 1942. The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1942)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `times` where `times[i] = [arrival_i, leaving_i]` indicates the arrival and leaving times of the `i`-th friend. All arrival times are distinct. A friend will occupy the unoccupied chair with the smallest number. Return the chair number that the k-th friend will sit on.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the arrival and leaving times guaranteed to be integers?
   - Yes.
2. Will the friends always leave the chairs in the same order they arrived?
   - No, friends can leave in any order.
3. Is it possible for arrival and leaving times to be negative?
   - No, all times are non-negative integers.
4. Do we need to handle friends arriving at the exact same time?
   - Given the constraint that all arrival times are distinct, no two friends will arrive at the same time.
5. Should the index `k` be within the bounds of the array length?
   - Yes, assume `0 <= k < times.length`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Events**: First, we need to process the arrival and leaving events in chronological order. We create an event list that includes both arrivals and departures.
2. **Min-Heap for Chairs**:
   - Use a min-heap to quickly find the smallest unoccupied chair.
   - Use another min-heap to keep track of currently occupied chairs and their respective leaving times.
3. **Processing Events**:
   - While processing arrival events, assign the smallest available chair from the min-heap.
   - When processing departure events, release the occupied chair and add it back to the available chairs heap.
4. **Return Result**: Keep track of the chair assigned to each friend so that we can return the chair for the k-th friend.

### Code

```javascript
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    insert(value) {
        this.heap.push(value);
        this.bubbleUp();
    }
    
    extractMin() {
        if (this.size() === 1) return this.heap.pop();
        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this.bubbleDown();
        return min;
    }
    
    bubbleUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index] >= this.heap[parentIndex]) break;
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]] = [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    bubbleDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[0];
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild < element) swap = leftChildIndex;
            }

            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
                if ((swap === null && rightChild < element) || (swap !== null && rightChild < leftChild)) {
                    swap = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (swap === null) break;
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[swap]] = [this.heap[swap], this.heap[index]];
            index = swap;
        }
    }
    
    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }
    
    peek() {
        return this.heap[0] || null;
    }
}

var smallestChair = function(times, k) {
    let events = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
        const [arrival, leaving] = times[i];
        events.push([arrival, i, 'arrive']);
        events.push([leaving, i, 'leave']);
    }

    events.sort(([time1], [time2]) => time1 - time2);

    const availableChairs = new MinHeap();
    for (let i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
        availableChairs.insert(i);
    }

    let chairMap = {};

    for (let [time, friendIndex, event] of events) {
        if (event === 'leave') {
            availableChairs.insert(chairMap[friendIndex]);
        } else {
            let chair = availableChairs.extractMin();
            chairMap[friendIndex] = chair;
            if (friendIndex == k) return chair;
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the events: \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of events (2 times the number of friends).
- Inserting and extracting from the min-heap: \(O(\log n)\) for each operation.
- Processing events: \(O(n \log n)\) as we are processing \(2 \times n\) events (`times.length` arrivals and `times.length` departures) with each insert/extract operation taking \(O(\log n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
