[Leetcode 3045. Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3045)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of strings `words1` and `words2`. A string `p1` from `words1` and a string `s1` from `words2` forms a *prefix-suffix pair* if `p1` is a prefix of `s1` and `s1` is a suffix of `p1`.

Return the total number of prefix-suffix pairs.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["a", "ab", "abc"], words2 = ["a", "bc", "abc"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The pairs are ("a", "a"), ("ab", "abc"), and ("abc", "abc").
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the strings in `words1` or `words2` be empty?
2. Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
3. Are the strings guaranteed to be lowercase?

Assuming the answers to be:
1. Yes, strings can be empty.
2. Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive.
3. Yes, strings in the arrays are all lowercase.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of prefix-suffix pairs.
2. Iterate through each string in `words1`:
   - For each string in `words1`, check every string in `words2`:
      - Check if the string from `words1` is a prefix of the string from `words2`.
      - Check if the string from `words2` is a suffix of the string from `words1`.
      - If both conditions are true, increment the counter.
3. Return the counter value.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words1
 * @param {string[]} words2
 * @return {number}
 */
const countPrefixSuffixPairs = (words1, words2) => {
    let count = 0;

    for (let p1 of words1) {
        for (let s1 of words2) {
            if (s1.startsWith(p1) && p1.endsWith(s1)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example
const words1 = ["a", "ab", "abc"];
const words2 = ["a", "bc", "abc"];
console.log(countPrefixSuffixPairs(words1, words2)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n * m * (k + l)), where:
- `n` is the length of `words1`.
- `m` is the length of `words2`.
- `k` is the average length of strings in `words1`.
- `l` is the average length of strings in `words2`.

The startsWith and endsWith methods both run in O(k + l), making the nested loops more costly.

However, for large inputs, the prefix and suffix checks can be optimized using advanced data structures like tries or suffix trees, but for now, a straightforward approach is implemented.
