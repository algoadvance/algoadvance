[Leetcode 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1790)
## Problem Statement:

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, return `true` if you can swap two characters in `s1` so that the result is equal to `s2`, otherwise, return `false`.

Example:
1. `s1 = "bank"`, `s2 = "kanb"` -> `true`
2. `s1 = "attack"`, `s2 = "defend"` -> `false`
3. `s1 = "kelb"`, `s2 = "kelb"` -> `true`

Note: You are only allowed to swap two characters exactly once.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Are the strings always the same length?
   - Yes, both strings are guaranteed to be of the same length.
   
2. Can the strings contain special characters or numbers?
   - Yes, strings can contain any printable characters.

3. Should we consider case sensitivity?
   - Yes, the problem is case-sensitive.

## Strategy:

1. **Initial Check for Length**:
   - Since the strings are guaranteed to be of equal length, we don't need to check for length equality.

2. **Identify Positions of Mismatch**:
   - Iterate through both strings and identify the positions where the characters differ. 
   - Store these positions in a list.

3. **Evaluate the Mismatches**:
   - If there are more than 2 mismatches, return `false` as more than one swap is needed.
   - If there are exactly 2 mismatches, check if swapping the characters at these indices in `s1` would make `s1` equal to `s2`.
   - If there are 0 mismatches, it means the strings are already equal, and return `true`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there's exactly 1 mismatch, return `false` because one swap wouldn't suffice to fix just one mismatch.

## Code:

```javascript
function areAlmostEqual(s1, s2) {
    if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
    
    let mismatches = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        if (s1[i] !== s2[i]) {
            mismatches.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    if (mismatches.length === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if (mismatches.length !== 2) {
        return false;
    }
    
    let [i, j] = mismatches;
    return s1[i] === s2[j] && s1[j] === s2[i];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(areAlmostEqual("bank", "kanb")); // true
console.log(areAlmostEqual("attack", "defend")); // false
console.log(areAlmostEqual("kelb", "kelb")); // true
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we iterate through the strings just once to find mismatches.
- Space complexity is **O(1)** (ignoring the space used to store the mismatches) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

This solution ensures that we can efficiently determine if a single swap can make the two strings equal by leveraging the properties of mismatches between the two strings.
