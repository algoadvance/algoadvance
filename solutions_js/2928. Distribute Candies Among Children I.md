[Leetcode 2928. Distribute Candies Among Children I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2928)
### Problem Statement

You are given a candy array `candies` where `candies[i]` is the number of candies of the `i-th` type you have. You have to distribute these candies among children, ensuring each child gets an equal number of candies of each type. Return the maximum number of children who can receive the candies.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints we need to consider about the number of candy types or the number of candies in each type?**
   - You may assume that the candy array will contain non-negative integers and possible size constraints as per typical problem settings in competitive programming, e.g., up to 10^4 types and 10^9 candies of each type.

2. **Do we need to worry about handling fragments of candies?**
   - No, we assume candies are indivisible units, so the distribution and results will be in whole numbers.

3. **Is there a minimum or maximum number of children that we need to consider?**
   - The minimum number of children is zero (which is trivial and not practically interesting), and for the maximum, it depends on the given candies array.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to focus on the following steps:
1. **Understand the per child distribution constraint**, i.e., each child must receive the same number of candies of each type.
2. **Compute the maximum number of children**, which is constrained by the type having the least supply of candies.

#### Steps:
1. Loop through each type of candies and determine how many children can receive these candies by finding the minimum value of `candies[i] // k` where `k` is a potential number of children.
2. The maximum number of children that can be satisfied is determined by the type with the smallest per child candies availability.

### Code

```javascript
function maxNumberOfChildren(candies) {
    if (candies.length === 0) return 0;

    // Find the minimum number of candies of any type
    let minCandies = candies[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < candies.length; i++) {
        if (candies[i] < minCandies) {
            minCandies = candies[i];
        }
    }

    // We can distribute candies equally among minCandies children
    return minCandies;
}

// Example usage:
let candies = [3, 9, 12];
console.log(maxNumberOfChildren(candies)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of different types of candies. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once to find the minimum value.

In essence, the algorithm efficiently determines the maximum number of children by leveraging straightforward iteration and mininum finding operations.
