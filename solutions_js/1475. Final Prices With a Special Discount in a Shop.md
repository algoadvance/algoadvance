[Leetcode 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1475)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `i-th` item in a shop. There is a special discount rule:
- For each item `i`, you will receive a discount equivalent to the price of the next item `j` (where `j > i`) which has a price less than or equal to the price of item `i`.

If there are no such items `j`, you won't receive any discount for item `i`.

Return an array where the `i-th` element is the final price you will pay for the `i-th` item after applying the above discount.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain duplicate prices?
   - Yes, it can.
2. What is the range of the elements in the prices array? 
   - Typically, they will range from low to fairly high values but will be within the constraints of standard integer ranges.
3. Is the array guaranteed to have at least one element?
   - Yes.

### Code

```javascript
function finalPrices(prices) {
    const final = [...prices]; // Make a copy of the prices array
    
    for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
            if (prices[j] <= prices[i]) {
                final[i] = prices[i] - prices[j]; 
                break; // Apply the first applicable discount and move to the next item
            }
        }
    }
    
    return final;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Final Prices Copy:** Create a copy of the `prices` array to keep track of the final adjusted prices.
  
2. **Iterate Through Each Item:** Loop through each item `i` of the `prices`.

3. **Check for the Discount:** For each item `i`, check the subsequent items `j` (where `j > i`) to find the first item with a price less than or equal to `prices[i]`.

4. **Apply Discount:** If such an item is found, apply the discount by subtracting `prices[j]` from `prices[i]`.

5. **Move to the Next Item:** Break out of the inner loop once the first qualifying item for the discount is found and processed.

6. **Return Final Prices:** After processing all items, return the array with final prices.

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the `prices` array. This is because for each item `i`, we potentially check each subsequent item `j`, leading to nested loops.
- Space complexity is `O(n)` due to the copied array to store the final prices.

To optimize further, we could consider using a stack to keep track of prices, but the above implementation sticks to a straightforward brute-force approach for simplicity in understanding and initial implementation.
