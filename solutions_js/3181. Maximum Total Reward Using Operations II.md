[Leetcode 3181. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3181)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer array `operations`, both arrays are of the same length. You can perform the following operation at most once: choose an index `i` and replace `nums[i]` with `operations[i]`. The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `nums` after applying the operation (if any).

Write a function `maximizeReward(nums, operations)` that returns the maximum possible sum of the array `nums` after applying the operation (if any).

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4], operations = [2, 4, 8]
Output: 13
Explanation: Replace nums[1] with operations[1], final array becomes [1, 4, 4] with sum 9.
             Replace nums[2] with operations[2], final array becomes [1, 2, 8] with sum 11.
             The optimal operation is nums[2] with operations[2].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the arrays `nums` and `operations` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, both arrays can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **What should be done if `nums` and `operations` have different lengths?**
   - The problem guarantees that `nums` and `operations` have the same length.
   
3. **Is it possible to have the arrays `nums` and `operations` be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible, and in this case, the function should return 0.

### Code

```javascript
function maximizeReward(nums, operations) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0; // Edge case if arrays are empty.

  let currentSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  let maxSum = currentSum;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let newSum = currentSum - nums[i] + operations[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, newSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximizeReward([1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 1])); // Should output 9.
console.log(maximizeReward([1, 2, 4], [2, 4, 8])); // Should output 13.
console.log(maximizeReward([], [])); // Should output 0.
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: First, calculate the initial sum of the `nums` array.
2. **Iterate Over Indices**: Loop through each index of the arrays `nums` and `operations`.
3. **Calculate New Sum**: For each index `i`, calculate the potential new sum if `nums[i]` is replaced with `operations[i]`.
4. **Track Maximum Sum**: Update the maximum sum with the largest value found.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The function loops through the arrays once to calculate the initial sum and once more to find the potential maximum sum, making the time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` (and `operations`) array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few extra variables and do not use any data structures that depend on the input size.

By following this strategy and implementation, we can efficiently determine the maximum possible sum of the `nums` array after applying at most one operation.
