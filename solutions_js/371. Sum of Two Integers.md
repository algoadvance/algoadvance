[Leetcode 371. Sum of Two Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l371)
### Problem Statement
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators `+` and `-`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the integers be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, the integers can be negative, zero, or positive.
2. **Q:** What is the range of the integers?
   - **A:** You can assume the integers are within the 32-bit signed integer range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.

### Strategy
To solve this problem without using the `+` and `-` operators, we can use bitwise operations. The key idea is to use the fact that addition can be performed using bitwise operations for carry and sum.

1. **Sum without carry:** Using XOR (^) operator. This gives the sum of bits where at least one of the bits is not set.
2. **Carry:** Using AND (&) operator followed by a left shift (<<) by one. This gives us the carry, which needs to be added to the sum.

We repeat the process until there is no carry left.

### Code

```javascript
function getSum(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        // Calculate the carry
        let carry = (a & b) << 1;
        
        // Calculate the sum without carry
        a = a ^ b;
        
        // Update b to the carry calculated
        b = carry;
    }
    return a;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(getSum(1, 2)); // Output: 3
console.log(getSum(-2, 3)); // Output: 1
console.log(getSum(-1, -1)); // Output: -2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because the number of bits in the integer is fixed (32 bits). Each iteration handles the next bit, and it takes a fixed number of operations per bit. Thus, the while loop runs a constant amount of time for any integer within the 32-bit range.
