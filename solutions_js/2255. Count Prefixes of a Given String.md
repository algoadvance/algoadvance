[Leetcode 2255. Count Prefixes of a Given String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2255)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`. A string is considered a prefix of `s` if it starts with the same characters as `s`. You need to determine how many strings in the list `words` are prefixes of the given string `s`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: words = ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
```

**Explanation:**
The strings in `words` that are prefixes of `s` are "a", "ab", and "abc".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if there are no prefixes in `words` that match the string `s`?**
   - The function should return `0`.
2. **Can the words list be empty?**
   - Yes, in which case the return value should be `0`.
3. **Will the input strings contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem constraints ensure that the input will contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with a counter set to `0`.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through each string in the `words` array.
3. **Checking Prefix**: For each word, check if it is a prefix of the string `s`. This can be efficiently done using the `String.prototype.startsWith()` method in JavaScript.
4. **Increment Counter**: If a word is a prefix, increment the counter.
5. **Return the Counter**: After the loop, return the total count of prefix matches.

This strategy ensures that each word is checked only once, resulting in an efficient solution.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function countPrefixes(words, s) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let word of words) {
        if (s.startsWith(word)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let words = ["a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc"];
let s = "abc";

console.log(countPrefixes(words, s)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * m)`, where:
- `n` is the number of words in the `words` array.
- `m` is the average length of the words.

In the worst case, each word may need to be compared character by character with the prefix of `s`, leading to this `O(n * m)` complexity. However, given that checking a prefix in JavaScript with `startsWith` is generally efficient due to internal optimizations, this approach is quite performant for average use cases.
