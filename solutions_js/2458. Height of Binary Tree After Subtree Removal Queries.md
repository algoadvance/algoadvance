[Leetcode 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2458)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node in the tree has a unique value in the range `[1, n]`.

You are also given an array `queries` where each `queries[i]` represents a node value. For each query, you are supposed to remove the subtree rooted at that node, and then determine the height of the resulting tree (the longest path from the root to a leaf node).

Return an array where `result[i]` is the height of the tree after the `i`-th query has been executed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically in competitive programming, constraints will be given, but if not specified, we should expect large inputs (up to 10^4 or more).
   
2. **Can we assume all values in `queries` are unique and present in the tree?**
   - Yes, we can assume that all the node values in `queries` are unique and present in the tree.
   
3. **Do we have guaranteed connectivity (i.e., after removing a subtree, is the remaining part always a connected tree)?**
   - Yes, the remaining part will always still be a connected tree with the root being part of it.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal and Height Calculation:**
   - We need to calculate the height of the tree, which can be done using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach.
   
2. **Subtree Removal Impact:**
   - When a subtree is removed, only the ancestor nodes (up to the ancestor of the removed subtree) might have their heights affected.

3. **Preprocessing Heights:**
   - Precompute the height of each node in the initial tree so that subtree removal operations can be more efficient.
   
4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, update the height of the affected nodes and avoid redundant re-calculations by keeping track of the remaining structure dynamically.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function computeHeights(root, nodeHeights, depths) {
    const dfs = (node, depth) => {
        if (!node) return -1;
        depths[node.val] = depth;
        const leftHeight = dfs(node.left, depth + 1);
        const rightHeight = dfs(node.right, depth + 1);
        nodeHeights[node.val] = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
        return nodeHeights[node.val];
    };
    dfs(root, 0);
}

function heightAfterSubtreeRemovalQueries(root, queries) {
    const nodeHeights = Array(100005).fill(0);
    const depths = Array(100005).fill(0);
    
    computeHeights(root, nodeHeights, depths);
    
    let currentMaxHeight = Math.max(...nodeHeights);
    const result = [];

    for (const query of queries) {
        if (query === root.val) {
            result.push(0); // If root is removed, tree does not exist
        } else {
            // Initial subtree height.
            const subtreeHeight = nodeHeights[query];

            // Depth of the removed node
            const depth = depths[query];

            // Compute the maximum height after this node is removed.
            const newMaxHeight = Math.max(currentMaxHeight - subtreeHeight - 1 + depth);

            result.push(newMaxHeight);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(6);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);

const queries = [3, 4, 1];
console.log(heightAfterSubtreeRemovalQueries(root, queries)); // Output should reflect the height after removing subtrees rooted at these nodes
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing Heights and Depths:**
   - The DFS ensures we calculate heights and depths in O(n) time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - Each query involves a few constant-time lookups and arithmetic operations, making it O(1) per query.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n + q), where `q` is the number of queries given. This ensures efficient handling in practice for large trees and multiple queries.
