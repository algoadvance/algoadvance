[Leetcode 2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2435)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are tasked with finding the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix such that the sum of the values along the path is divisible by `k`.

A path is defined as a sequence of cells starting from the top-left corner (0,0) and ending at the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1) where you can only move right or down.

Return the number of such paths. As the number of paths could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example

```javascript
Input: grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths with a sum divisible by 3: 
1.) 5 -> 3 -> 0 -> 7
2.) 5 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid contain negative numbers?**
   - Typically not, but let's assume the grid contains non-negative integers unless specified otherwise.
   
2. **What is the maximum size of the grid?**
   - It could be helpful to know the constraints on `m` and `n` to optimize our solution properly.

3. **Can we reuse the same cell more than once on the same path?**
   - No, we can only move right or down and cannot revisit cells.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). We will maintain a DP table `dp[r][c][mod]` where `dp[r][c][mod]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(r, c)` with a sum that leaves a remainder `mod` when divided by `k`.

### Steps:

1. Initialize a 3D DP array where `dp[r][c][mod]` initially is 0 for all entries.
2. As we traverse the grid, update the DP table based on the values of cells and the possible paths (right or down).
3. The transition will be based on the previously computed values:
   - Coming from the top: `dp[r][c][(mod + grid[r][c]) % k] += dp[r-1][c][mod]`
   - Coming from the left: `dp[r][c][(mod + grid[r][c]) % k] += dp[r][c-1][mod]`
4. Our answer will be found in `dp[m-1][n-1][0]`, which gives the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell with a sum divisible by `k`.

### Code

```javascript
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

function numberOfPaths(grid, k) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    
    // Create a 3D dp array and initialize it
    const dp = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => 
        Array.from({ length: cols }, () => 
            Array(k).fill(0)
        )
    );
    
    // Initial position
    dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1;
    
    // Populate the dp table
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            for (let mod = 0; mod < k; mod++) {
                if (r > 0) {
                    const newMod = (mod + grid[r][c]) % k;
                    dp[r][c][newMod] = (dp[r][c][newMod] + dp[r-1][c][mod]) % MOD;
                }
                if (c > 0) {
                    const newMod = (mod + grid[r][c]) % k;
                    dp[r][c][newMod] = (dp[r][c][newMod] + dp[r][c-1][mod]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[rows-1][cols-1][0];
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n * k)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each cell and for each cell, we iterate through each possible remainder modulo `k`. 

The space complexity is also **O(m * n * k)** due to the 3D DP array used to store the number of paths for each cell and each remainder.

This solution should be efficient enough for typical constraints you might encounter in a LeetCode problem.
