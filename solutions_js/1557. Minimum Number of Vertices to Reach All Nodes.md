[Leetcode 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1557)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** with `n` vertices labeled from `0 to n-1` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Self-loops and multiple edges:** Are there any self-loop edges or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   - **Answer:** No, the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), meaning there are no cycles, and we assume no multiple edges or self-loops.

2. **Edge cases:** Should we consider cases where there are no edges or only one node?
   - **Answer:** Yes, handle these cases appropriately. If there are no edges, all nodes are isolated and should be included in the result.

### Strategy

The key insight is that in order to reach all nodes, starting from nodes with no incoming edges (indegree of zero) is sufficient. Nodes with no incoming edges have to be part of the set because there's no other way to reach them.

#### Steps:

1. Compute the indegree of each node.
2. Identify nodes with an indegree of zero.
3. Return these nodes as they form the smallest set of vertices that can reach all other nodes in the DAG.

### Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation to solve the problem:

```javascript
var findSmallestSetOfVertices = function(n, edges) {
    const indegree = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Calculate indegree for each node
    edges.forEach(([from, to]) => {
        indegree[to]++;
    });

    // Find nodes with an indegree of zero
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] === 0) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(m\) is the number of edges. This is because:
- We initialize the `indegree` array in \(O(n)\) time.
- We iterate over each edge to compute the indegree in \(O(m)\) time.
- We then iterate over the nodes to collect those with zero indegree, which takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n + m)\). This is efficient and suitable for typical graph problems.
