[Leetcode 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1717)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and two non-overlapping substrings `x` and `y` with respective scores `x_score` and `y_score`, you need to remove `x` or `y` from `s` with the maximum score possible.

You can remove one substring at a time, each removal operation gives you a score depending on the substring being removed. Repeat this operation until no more substrings can be removed. The task is to compute the highest possible score you can get.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `x` and `y` overlap in the string `s`?
   - The problem states non-overlapping substrings, but an explicit confirmation from the interviewer would be good.
2. Does the order of removal matter?
   - Yes, it can affect the maximum score.
3. How large can the string `s` be?
   - Clarifying string length ensures we consider edge cases like performance with long strings.

## Strategy

1. **Greedy Approach**: Aim to remove the higher-scoring substring first to maximize the score at the earliest stage.
2. **Order Matters**: Since removing different substrings first can lead to different remaining substrings, we should simulate both scenarios and return the max score:
   - First, remove as many occurrences of `x` as possible, then remove `y`.
   - Alternatively, remove as many occurrences of `y` as possible, then remove `x`.

## Code

Here is the JavaScript solution implementing the described strategy:

```javascript
var maximumScore = function(s, x, y, x_score, y_score) {
    function computeScore(main, alt, mainScore, altScore) {
        let score = 0;
        let stack = [];
        let n = s.length;
    
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            stack.push(s[i]);
            if (stack.length >= main.length && stack.slice(-main.length).join('') === main) {
                for(let j = 0; j < main.length; j++) stack.pop();
                score += mainScore;
            }
        }
        
        const remainingString = stack.join('');
        stack = [];
    
        for (let i = 0; i < remainingString.length; i++) {
            stack.push(remainingString[i]);
            if (stack.length >= alt.length && stack.slice(-alt.length).join('') === alt) {
                for(let j = 0; j < alt.length; j++) stack.pop();
                score += altScore;
            }
        }
        
        return score;
    }
    
    // Greedy approach to maximize score by considering both orders
    const score1 = computeScore(x, y, x_score, y_score);
    const score2 = computeScore(y, x, y_score, x_score);
    
    return Math.max(score1, score2);
};
```

## Explanation

1. **computeScore Function**: This helper function does the heavy lifting:
   - Removes all non-overlapping occurrences of a given substring `main`.
   - Then processes the remaining string to remove all non-overlapping occurrences of `alt`.
   - It maintains a running score.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Compute the score by first removing `x` and then `y`.
   - Compute the score by reversing the removal order.
   - Return the maximum score from both attempts.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s` because:
- Each character is processed in a single pass for both scenarios.

This ensures the solution is efficient even for relatively large strings.
