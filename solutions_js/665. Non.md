### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. 

A non-decreasing array is an array where `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for every `i` (0-based) such that `0 <= i <= n-2`.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array size `n`?**
   The array size `n` can be large, potentially up to \(10^4\).
   
2. **What is the range of the array elements?**
   Elements of the array can be positive or negative integers within the range of 32-bit signed integers.

3. **Can we assume the input is always valid?**
   Yes, the input will always be a valid array of integers.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Violations:** As we traverse the array, we count the violations where `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.
2. **Handle Violations:**
    - If there's more than one violation, return `false`.
    - If there's exactly one violation at `i`:
        * We need to decide whether to modify `nums[i]` or `nums[i+1]` to fix the violation.
        * Modify `nums[i]` to match `nums[i-1]` if it doesn't create another violation.
        * Modify `nums[i+1]` to match `nums[i]` if modifying `nums[i]` isnâ€™t viable.

This solution ensures that we only modify up to one element to fix the array.

### Code

```javascript
function checkPossibility(nums) {
    let count = 0;  // To count the violations
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            if (count > 1) {
                return false;
            }
            // Try to fix the violation
            if (i === 0 || nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = nums[i + 1];  // Modify nums[i] to fix the array
            } else {
                nums[i + 1] = nums[i];  // Modify nums[i+1] as last resort
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(checkPossibility([4, 2, 3]));  // Output: true
console.log(checkPossibility([4, 2, 1]));  // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once, performing a constant amount of work for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This efficient approach ensures that we can determine the viability of modifying the array to a non-decreasing sequence by examining it in a linear pass.
