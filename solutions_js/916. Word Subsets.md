[Leetcode 916. Word Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l916)
### Problem Statement

You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.

A string `b` is a subset of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.

- For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string `a` from `words1` is a universal string if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the universal strings in `words1`. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the strings and the maximum number of words in `words1` and `words2`?
2. **Character Set**: Are the strings all lowercase English letters?
3. **Output Order**: Does the order of the output array matter?

### Code

```javascript
var wordSubsets = function(words1, words2) {
    // Helper function to get the frequency count of characters in a word
    const getCharCount = (word) => {
        const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let char of word) {
            count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        return count;
    };
    
    // Get the maximum frequency requirement from words2
    const maxFreq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let word of words2) {
        const charCount = getCharCount(word);
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            maxFreq[i] = Math.max(maxFreq[i], charCount[i]);
        }
    }
    
    // Check each word in words1 to see if it matches the maximum frequency requirement
    const result = [];
    for (let word of words1) {
        const charCount = getCharCount(word);
        let universal = true;
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (charCount[i] < maxFreq[i]) {
                universal = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (universal) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Character Count Calculation**: A helper function `getCharCount` is created to determine the frequency of each character in a given word.
2. **Maximum Frequency Requirement**: We then iterate through `words2` to determine the maximum frequency of each character required among all words in `words2`.
3. **Validation**: For each word in `words1`, we compute its character counts and check if it meets the maximum frequency requirements determined from `words2`.

### Time Complexity

- **Character Count Calculation**:
  - Getting character counts for one word: \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the length of the word.
- **Processing words2**:
  - For each word in `words2`: \(O(K \times L)\), where \(K\) is the number of words in `words2` and \(L\) is the average length of words in `words2`.
- **Processing words1**:
  - For each word in `words1` and checking against the frequency array: \(O(N \times L + 26)\), where \(N\) is the number of words in `words1` and \(L\) is the average length of words in `words1`.

- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \times L + K \times L)\), dominated by the larger of the two factors with both depending on the typical word length \(L\).
