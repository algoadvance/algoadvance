[Leetcode 3011. Find if Array Can Be Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3011)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr`. Your task is to determine if you can sort the array by removing exactly one element from it. In other words, check if there exists an element in the array such that after removing it, the remaining array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return `true` if the array can be sorted-out by removing exactly one element, otherwise return `false`.

### Example
```javascript
Input: arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: true
Explanation: Removing element 3 would result in [1, 2, 4] which is sorted.

Input: arr = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: Removing element 3 or 2 would result in a sorted array.

Input: arr = [3, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be sorted by removing just one element.
```
## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - Likely to assume standard constraints such as 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4.
   
2. **What elements are contained in the array?**
   - The array can contain any integers, both negative and positive.

3. **What if the array is already sorted?**
   - If the array is already sorted, then removing any one element should still keep the array sorted. In this case, the answer should be `true`.

## Strategy

1. **Find Violation Points:** Traverse the array to find the points where the order is violated.
2. **Check Removal Effect:** For each violation point, check if removing the element at that index or the next index will result in a sorted array.
3. **Edge Cases:** Check for edge cases such as already sorted arrays.

## Code

```javascript
function canBeSortedByRemovingOneElement(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    // Helper function to check if an array is sorted
    const isSorted = (array) => {
        for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[i - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Traverse to find violations
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
            // Two cases to check
            // Remove arr[i]
            if (isSorted([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)])) {
                return true;
            }
            // Remove arr[i - 1]
            if (isSorted([...arr.slice(0, i - 1), ...arr.slice(i)])) {
                return true;
            }
            // If neither removal works, return false
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // If no violation found, the array is already sorted
    return true;
}

// Test cases
console.log(canBeSortedByRemovingOneElement([1, 3, 2, 4])); // true
console.log(canBeSortedByRemovingOneElement([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])); // true
console.log(canBeSortedByRemovingOneElement([3, 2, 1])); // false
console.log(canBeSortedByRemovingOneElement([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // true
```

## Time Complexity

- The main function iterates through the array once, checking for violations: **O(n)**.
- In the worst-case scenario, for each violation, it could also require validating a nearly full-length subarray for sortedness, which is **O(n)**.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)** in the worst case.

This should perform efficiently for typical problem constraints, but improvements or optimizations might be necessary for larger input sizes.
