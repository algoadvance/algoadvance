[Leetcode 2280. Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2280)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei]` indicates the price of the stock on the `dayi`-th day. A line chart is created by connecting adjacent points with a line segment using these points. Write an efficient algorithm that finds the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart accurately.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the values of `day`s and `price`s? (E.g., range, uniqueness)
2. **Sorting:** Can we assume the input is sorted based on `day`? If not, should we sort it?
3. **Output:** Should the answer be the minimum number of line segments?

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:** First, sort the array `stockPrices` based on the `day` to ensure the points are in chronological order.
2. **Slope Calculation:** Use the concept of slope between two points to determine if three consecutive points lie on the same line. For three points \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), and \((x3, y3)\), the slopes are:
   \[
   \text{slope1} = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
   \]
   \[
   \text{slope2} = \frac{y3 - y2}{x3 - x2}
   \]
   If `slope1` equals `slope2`, then the points lie on the same line.
3. **Counting Lines:** Initialize a counter for the number of lines, and iterate through the points checking for consecutive collinear points to decide if a new line is needed.

### Code

```javascript
function minLines(stockPrices) {
    if (stockPrices.length <= 1) return 0; // No lines needed for 0 or 1 point
  
    // Sort stockPrices based on day
    stockPrices.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
  
    let minLines = 1; // At least one line is needed if we have at least 2 points
  
    for (let i = 2; i < stockPrices.length; i++) {
        let [x1, y1] = stockPrices[i - 2];
        let [x2, y2] = stockPrices[i - 1];
        let [x3, y3] = stockPrices[i];
    
        // Calculate the slopes in a way that avoids floating point arithmetic
        let dx1 = x2 - x1;
        let dy1 = y2 - y1;
        let dx2 = x3 - x2;
        let dy2 = y3 - y2;
  
        // Check if (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) != (y3 - y2) / (x3 - x2)
        if (dy1 * dx2 !== dy2 * dx1) {
            minLines++;
        }
    }
  
    return minLines;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.
- **Checking Slopes:** We traverse the list once to check the slopes, which takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)\).
