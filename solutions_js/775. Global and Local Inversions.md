[Leetcode 775. Global and Local Inversions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l775)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `A` containing `n` distinct integers from `0` to `n - 1`. An inversion is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j < n` and `A[i] > A[j]`.

Global inversions are the number of inversions in the entire array. Local inversions are the number of inversions where `j = i + 1`.

Return `true` if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the array size n?**
   - The length of the array is at most 10^5.
2. **What values will the array elements contain?**
   - The array contains all integers from `0` to `n - 1` exactly once.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - If the number of global inversions equals the number of local inversions, it means that all the inversions are local. In other words, each inversion `(i, j)` where `A[i] > A[j]` must be adjacent (`j = i + 1`).

2. **Approach:**
   - Iterate through the array keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far until the second last element.
   - Compare the maximum value with the element at `i + 2`. If `A[i] > A[i + 2]` for any `i`, it's a global inversion that is not local, hence return `false`.

3. **Steps:**
   - Initialize `max_val` as the minimum possible integer.
   - Loop through the array up to the second last element and update `max_val`.
   - Check the condition for non-local inversions.
   - If no such condition is found, return `true`.

### Code
```javascript
var isIdealPermutation = function(A) {
    let max_val = -1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < A.length - 2; i++) {
        max_val = Math.max(max_val, A[i]);
        if (max_val > A[i + 2]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - This is because we are iterating over the array just once in a single loop.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space for the variable `max_val`.
