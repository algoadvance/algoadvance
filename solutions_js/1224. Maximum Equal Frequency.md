[Leetcode 1224. Maximum Equal Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1224)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return the maximum possible value of `maxEqualFreq`:
- `maxEqualFreq` is the largest index `i` such that the first `i` elements of `nums` can be rearranged to form exactly one of these configurations:
    1. Every integer occurs the same number of times.
    2. Every integer except one occurs the same number of times, and the only integer that has a different number of occurrences can only be incremented or decremented by one compared to the previous occurrence numbers.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the length of `nums` and the range of elements within `nums`?
   - **Answer**: The length of `nums` is between 1 and \(10^5\). Each element in `nums` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Output**: Can you confirm the output is the largest index `i` which meets the condition?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the output is the largest index `i`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of hash maps to keep track of the frequency of each integer and the frequency of those frequencies.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - `freq`: a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the `nums`.
   - `freqCount`: a dictionary to count how many numbers have a specific count of occurrences.
   - `maxFreq`: the current maximum frequency of any number.

2. **Iterate Through `nums`**:
   - For each element in `nums`, update `freq` and `freqCount`.
   - At each step, check if the current prefix of the array can validate one of the desired configurations:
     - All numbers have the same frequency.
     - All but one number have the same frequency, and the exception differs by one.

### Conditions to Check:
- There is only one number.
- All frequencies are the same.
- One number appears one more time than the others.
- One number appears exactly once and the outlier frequency is managed correctly.

### Code Implementation:

```javascript
var maxEqualFreq = function(nums) {
    const freq = new Map();
    const freqCount = new Map();
    let maxFreq = 0;
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let num = nums[i];
        
        // Update freq map for num
        if (freq.has(num)) {
            let f = freq.get(num);
            freq.set(num, f + 1);
            
            // Update freqCount
            if (freqCount.has(f)) freqCount.set(f, freqCount.get(f) - 1);
            if (freqCount.get(f) === 0) freqCount.delete(f);
            freqCount.set(f + 1, (freqCount.get(f + 1) || 0) + 1);
            
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, f + 1);
        } else {
            freq.set(num, 1);
            freqCount.set(1, (freqCount.get(1) || 0) + 1);
            
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, 1);
        }
        
        // Validate configurations
        if (
            // All frequencies the same
            freqCount.get(maxFreq) * maxFreq === i + 1 ||
            // All but one have frequency (maxFreq) and one has (maxFreq - 1)
            freqCount.get(maxFreq) * maxFreq + freqCount.get(maxFreq - 1) * (maxFreq - 1) === i + 1 ||
            // All but one have frequency 1
            freqCount.get(1) === i + 1
        ) {
            result = i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) since we are iterating through the list exactly once and dictionary operations are \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to storing frequencies in hash maps. 

This solution is efficient and leverages hash maps to maintain a manageable state for dynamic updates and condition checking.
