[Leetcode 793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l793)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `k`, return the number of non-negative integers `x` such that the number of trailing zeroes in `x!` (the factorial of `x`) is exactly `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `k`**: Are there any constraints on the value of `k` like upper or lower bounds?
   - Generally, `k` will be a non-negative integer, and for large values of `k`, we need to factor in large factorial calculations.
2. **Efficiency Requirements**: Should we consider optimal solutions in terms of time complexity, or are brute-force methods acceptable if we implement the solution correctly?
   - Ideally, we should aim for an optimal solution.

Assumptions:
- `k` is a non-negative integer.

### Strategy

To understand this problem, we need to understand how trailing zeroes in a factorial are produced:
- Trailing zeroes are produced by pairs of multiples of 2 and 5.
- Since multiples of 2 are more frequent than multiples of 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in numbers from 1 to `x`.

For a given `x`, the number of trailing zeroes in `x!` can be calculated using:
\[ \text{trailingZeroes}(x) = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{x}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{x}{125} \right\rfloor + \ldots \]

To solve this:
1. We need to count how many `x` have exactly `k` trailing zeroes.
2. We can determine if `x` has `k` trailing zeroes using the formula above.
3. We use binary search to efficiently find the range of `x` values that produce exactly `k` trailing zeroes.

### Code 

```javascript
function preimageSizeFZF(K) {
    const getTrailingZeroes = (n) => {
        let count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            n = Math.floor(n / 5);
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    };
    
    const findFirst = (K) => {
        let low = 0, high = 5 * (K + 1);
        while (low < high) {
            let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (getTrailingZeroes(mid) < K) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    };

    const start = findFirst(K);
    const end = findFirst(K + 1);
    
    return end - start;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(preimageSizeFZF(0));  // Expected output: 5
console.log(preimageSizeFZF(5));  // Expected output: 0
console.log(preimageSizeFZF(3));  // Expected output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- The function `getTrailingZeroes(n)` runs in \( O(\log n) \) because it repeatedly divides by 5.
- The binary search in `findFirst` runs in \( O(\log (K+1)) \), where each iteration calls `getTrailingZeroes(n)`.
- Consequently, `findFirst` will iterate up to \( O(\log (5*K)) \) times which makes the search efficient.

Overall, the complexity of finding the range and calculating the preimage size is approximately \( O(\log^2 K) \). This should be efficient enough for the input size constraints typically encountered in such problems.
