[Leetcode 2536. Increment Submatrices by One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2536)
### Problem Statement
You are given a matrix `mat` initially filled with zeros of size `m x n`. You will be given a 2D array `queries` where each query is represented as a subarray `[r1, c1, r2, c2]`. For each query, you need to increment all elements of the submatrix defined by its corners `(r1, c1)` (top-left) and `(r2, c2)` (bottom-right) by 1. Return the matrix `mat` after performing all queries.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the possible values for m and n?**
   - `m` and `n` can be assumed to be reasonably large, let's say up to 1000.

2. **How many queries can there be?**
   - The number of queries can also be up to a relatively large number, say up to 10^5.

3. **What is the range of `r1`, `r2`, `c1`, and `c2`?**
   - `0 <= r1 <= r2 < m` and `0 <= c1 <= c2 < n`.

4. **Is modifying the matrix incrementally for each query, i.e., element-wise, efficient enough?**
   - No, an efficient approach is needed to handle large matrices and numerous queries effectively.

### Strategy
To efficiently handle the problem, we can use the 2D difference array technique. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initialize a Difference Matrix**: Create a matrix `diff` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` initialized to 0. This matrix will help track the increments efficiently.
   
2. **Process Each Query Using Difference Matrix**:
   - For each query `[r1, c1, r2, c2]`, update the `diff` matrix:
     - Increment `diff[r1][c1]` by 1.
     - Decrement `diff[r1][c2+1]` by 1 if `c2 + 1` is within bounds.
     - Decrement `diff[r2+1][c1]` by 1 if `r2 + 1` is within bounds.
     - Increment `diff[r2+1][c2+1]` by 1 if both `r2 + 1` and `c2 + 1` are within bounds.

3. **Compute the Final Matrix from Difference Matrix**:
   - Convert the `diff` matrix into the final `mat` matrix using prefix sums to accumulate the changes.

### Code
Here is the full solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
var rangeAddQueries = function(m, n, queries) {
    // Initialize the difference matrix
    let diff = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Apply each query to the difference matrix
    for (let [r1, c1, r2, c2] of queries) {
        diff[r1][c1] += 1;
        if (c2 + 1 < n) diff[r1][c2 + 1] -= 1;
        if (r2 + 1 < m) diff[r2 + 1][c1] -= 1;
        if (r2 + 1 < m && c2 + 1 < n) diff[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] += 1;
    }
    
    // Create the resulting matrix `mat` from the difference matrix
    let mat = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i > 0) diff[i][j] += diff[i - 1][j];
            if (j > 0) diff[i][j] += diff[i][j - 1];
            if (i > 0 && j > 0) diff[i][j] -= diff[i - 1][j - 1];
            mat[i][j] = diff[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    return mat;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the Difference Matrix:** Each query modifies a constant number of elements, so applying all queries takes \( O(Q) \), where \( Q \) is the number of queries.
- **Computing the Final Matrix from the Difference Matrix:** It requires iteration over all elements of the matrix \( mat \), which takes \( O(m \times n) \).

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(m \times n + Q) \), which is efficient for large matrices and a large number of queries.
