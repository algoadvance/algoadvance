[Leetcode 1122. Relative Sort Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1122)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, write a function to return an array that bases its relative order on `arr2`. Elements that don't appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in ascending order.

- **Example 1:**
  ```
  Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
  Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
  ```

- **Constraints:**
  - `arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
  - `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
  - Each `arr2[i]` is distinct.
  - Each `arr2[i]` appears in `arr1` at least once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the elements that aren't in `arr2` also be unique?**
   No, elements that aren't in `arr2` can appear multiple times in `arr1`.

2. **Is it guaranteed that all elements in `arr2` are present in `arr1`?**
   Yes, the problem statement guarantees this.

3. **Can `arr1` contain duplicates of elements that are in `arr2`?**
   Yes, `arr1` can have multiple instances of the same element that's also in `arr2`.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Map:** Create a frequency map for all elements in `arr1`.
2. **Relative Order:** Traverse `arr2` and append elements to the result based on their frequency in `arr1`.
3. **Remaining Elements:** Append elements not in `arr2` to the result in ascending order.

### Code

```javascript
function relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2) {
    const freqMap = new Map();

    // Step 1: Create frequency map for arr1
    for (const num of arr1) {
        if (!freqMap.has(num)) {
            freqMap.set(num, 0);
        }
        freqMap.set(num, freqMap.get(num) + 1);
    }

    const result = [];

    // Step 2: Process elements based on arr2
    for (const num of arr2) {
        if (freqMap.has(num)) {
            const count = freqMap.get(num);
            for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                result.push(num);
            }
            freqMap.delete(num);  // Remove processed elements
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Process remaining elements not in arr2
    const remainingElements = [];
    for (const [num, count] of freqMap) {
        for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            remainingElements.push(num);
        }
    }
    // Sort the remaining elements and add to result
    remainingElements.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    result.push(...remainingElements);

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19];
const arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6];
console.log(relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2));  // [2, 2, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 9, 6, 7, 19]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Creating Frequency Map:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `arr1`.
- **Processing `arr2` Elements:** O(m), where `m` is the length of `arr2`.
- **Processing Remaining Elements:** O(n log n) for sorting.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n log n) because of the sorting step.
