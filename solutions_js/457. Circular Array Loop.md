[Leetcode 457. Circular Array Loop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l457)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 457: Circular Array Loop**

You are given a circular array `nums` of positive and negative integers. If a number `k` at an index is positive, move forward `k` steps. Conversely, if it's negative, move backward `k` steps. Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element brings you to the first element, and moving backward from the first element brings you to the last element.

A loop must contain at least two nodes and must be in a single direction.

Your task is to return `true` if there is a circular loop in the array, `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero?**
   - No, the array does not contain zero.
2. **Is the input strictly integers?**
   - Yes, the input array consists only of integers.
3. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The length of the array is between 1 and 5000.
4. **How should self-loops (single element pointing to itself) be handled?**
   - A valid loop must contain at least two different elements.

### Strategy

1. **Mark Visited Elements:** Use a visited marker to avoid revisiting elements. We can do this by marking elements with a special marker value distinct from valid array values.
  
2. **Slow and Fast Pointer:** Use two pointers, slow and fast, to detect cycles. We modify the classic Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm to handle circular array conditions and the direction.

3. **Directional Check:** Ensure that the loop only considers movements in the same direction (all positive or all negative). If directions change, the loop should be terminated early.

4. **Edge Case Handling:** Check if the array length is less than 2, where loops are impossible, and handle self-loops.

### Code

```javascript
function circularArrayLoop(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;

    const next = (idx) => {
        return ((idx + nums[idx]) % n + n) % n; // ensure wrapping around circularly
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 0) continue;

        let slow = i;
        let fast = i;
        let direction = nums[i] > 0;

        while (true) {
            slow = next(slow);
            if (nums[slow] === 0 || (nums[slow] > 0 !== direction)) break;

            fast = next(fast);
            if (nums[fast] === 0 || (nums[fast] > 0 !== direction)) break;

            fast = next(fast);
            if (nums[fast] === 0 || (nums[fast] > 0 !== direction)) break;

            if (slow === fast) {
                if (slow === next(slow)) break; // single element cycle is invalid
                return true;
            }
        }

        // mark all elements in the current path as 0 to indicate visited,
        // breaking the while loop in future iterations.
        let marker = i;
        while (nums[marker] !== 0 && (nums[marker] > 0 === direction)) {
            let nextMarker = next(marker);
            nums[marker] = 0;
            marker = nextMarker;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`. Each element is visited a constant number of times due to marking visited elements as 0.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. Only a constant amount of extra space is used.

This approach ensures that we efficiently detect cycles while managing constraints and edge cases effectively.
