[Leetcode 835. Image Overlap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l835)
### Problem Statement

Given two binary matrices `img1` and `img2`, represented as 2D arrays of integers (0s and 1s), you need to find the largest possible overlapping area. You can translate one of the images in four directions: up, down, left, right. (This means to move the image through some number of points in a chosen direction.) The overlapping area is calculated by counting the number of overlapping 1s.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: Are `img1` and `img2` always square matrices?  
   * Yes, the problem assumes `img1` and `img2` have the same dimensions and they are N x N matrices.

2. **Movement Constraints**: Is there any constraint on the amount by which we can shift the matrix?  
   * For each translation along the four directions (up, down, left, right), you can move `img2` by pixels between 0 and N-1 in each direction.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Generate All Translations**: For each possible translation, calculate the number of overlapping 1s.
2. **Count Overlap**: For each translation, count how many positions `img1` and `img2` both have 1s.
3. **Track Max Overlap**: Keep track of the maximum overlap found.

Given that `img1` and `img2` are N x N matrices, we consider all possible translations by shifting `img2` over `img1`.

The number of possible translations in both x and y direction ranges from -N+1 to N-1. For each translation, calculate the overlap and find the maximum overlap.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation for the described strategy:

```javascript
function largestOverlap(img1, img2) {
    const n = img1.length;
    
    // Function to count overlapping ones for a given translation
    function countOverlap(xShift, yShift) {
        let count = 0;
        for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (
                    r + xShift >= 0 && r + xShift < n &&
                    c + yShift >= 0 && c + yShift < n &&
                    img1[r + xShift][c + yShift] === 1 &&
                    img2[r][c] === 1
                ) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    let maxOverlap = 0;
    // Try all shifts (xShift, yShift) from -n+1 to n-1
    for (let xShift = -n + 1; xShift < n; xShift++) {
        for (let yShift = -n + 1; yShift < n; yShift++) {
            maxOverlap = Math.max(maxOverlap, countOverlap(xShift, yShift));
        }
    }
    
    return maxOverlap;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Shift Count**: We are considering `(2n-1) * (2n-1)` possible shifts.
2. **Overlap Calculation**: For each shift, we check the overlap, which takes `O(n^2)` time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O((2n-1)^2 * n^2) \approx O(n^4) \]

This brute force solution is feasible for smaller matrices (e.g., where `n <= 30`), but it may need optimization for larger matrices.
