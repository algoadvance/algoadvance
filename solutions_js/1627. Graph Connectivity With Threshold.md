[Leetcode 1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1627)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, indicating that you have `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `queries`, where each `queries[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you need to determine if cities `a_i` and `b_i` are connected.

Two cities `a` and `b` are connected if there is a path of adjacent cities using only edges with a common divisor greater than a certain threshold value `t`. More formally, there is an edge between cities `u` and `v` if and only if `gcd(u, v) > t`.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if cities `a_i` and `b_i` are connected for the `i-th` query, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on values of `n` and `t`?
2. Are there any constraints on the length and values within the `queries` array?

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
  constructor(size) {
    this.root = Array.from({length: size}, (_, index) => index);
    this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
  }

  find(x) {
    if (this.root[x] === x) {
      return x;
    }
    return this.root[x] = this.find(this.root[x]);
  }

  union(x, y) {
    let rootX = this.find(x);
    let rootY = this.find(y);

    if (rootX !== rootY) {
      if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.root[rootY] = rootX;
      } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
        this.root[rootX] = rootY;
      } else {
        this.root[rootY] = rootX;
        this.rank[rootX] += 1;
      }
    }
  }
}

const gcd = (a, b) => {
  while (b !== 0) {
    [a, b] = [b, a % b];
  }
  return a;
};

var areConnected = function(n, threshold, queries) {
  const uf = new UnionFind(n + 1);

  for (let i = threshold + 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i) {
      uf.union(i, j);
    }
  }

  const answer = [];
  for (const [a, b] of queries) {
    answer.push(uf.find(a) === uf.find(b));
  }

  return answer;
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Use Union-Find to handle connected components of the cities.
   - Connect cities with edges having a common divisor greater than `threshold`.

2. **Union-Find Initialization**:
   - Initialize a Union-Find data structure for cities from `1` to `n`.

3. **Union Cities by Common Divisor**:
   - For each city from `threshold + 1` to `n`, union it with its multiples within the range.

4. **Answer Queries**:
   - For each query, check if the two cities are in the same connected component.

## Time Complexity
- **Union-Find Initialization**: \( O(n) \)
- **Union Operations**: Typically \( O(\log n) \) per union operation, making it efficient for large `n`.
- **Query Operations**: \( O(1) \) per query due to path compression.
- Overall, the time complexity of processing all queries depends on the total number of union operations and query checks, but practically remains efficient.
