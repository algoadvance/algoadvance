[Leetcode 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1237)
## Problem Statement

You are given a function `f(x, y)` that gives a positive integer value between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and you are given an integer `z`. Your task is to find all pairs of positive integers `(x, y)` such that `f(x, y) == z`.

The function `f` is a secret function from a hidden API. You do not need to implement it but can call it to get the result for given values of `x` and `y`.

Return a list of all pairs of positive integers `(x, y)` such that `f(x, y) == z`.

The solution needs to be an array of arrays. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

### Example:

```
Input: z = 5
Output: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,1]]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= z <= 1000`
- `1 <= x, y <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `f(x, y)` take `x` and `y` values greater than 1000?
    - No, x and y will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
2. Can we assume that `f(x, y)` is well-defined and returns the same value for the same pair `(x, y)`?
    - Yes, `f(x, y)` is deterministic.
3. Do we need to handle any specific edge cases, such as when `z` is very small or very large?
    - The constraints ensure that `z` will be between 1 and 1000, so we don't need to handle extreme cases outside this range.

## Strategy:
1. **Brute Force Approach**:
    - Iterate over all possible values of `x` and `y` in the range [1, 1000].
    - Check if `f(x, y) == z`.
    - If true, add the pair `(x, y)` to the result list.
    - Return the list of pairs.

2. **Optimization Considerations**:
    - Given the constraints, up to 1,000,000 (1000 x 1000) checks will be performed, which should be manageable.

3. **Alternative Methods**:
    - Use two-pointer technique if the function has specific monotonic properties (such as sorted output).

Given the constraints, let's proceed with the brute force solution.

### Time Complexity:
- The brute force method will have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the range of possible values for `x` and `y` (1000 in this case). This results in at most 1,000,000 calls.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * This is the function you have to use, you cannot change its implementation.
 * 
 * This is a mock function for demonstration and won't be used in final implementation.
 * Assume this function is implemented in hidden API.
 */
var customfunction = {
    f: function(x, y) {
        // Example secret function implementation
        return x + y;
    }
};

/**
 * @param {CustomFunction} customfunction
 * @param {integer} z
 * @return {integer[][]}
 */
var findSolution = function(customfunction, z) {
    let result = [];

    for (let x = 1; x <= 1000; x++) {
        for (let y = 1; y <= 1000; y++) {
            if (customfunction.f(x, y) === z) {
                result.push([x, y]);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
// Assuming we have already defined the customfunction and z
let customfunctionAPI = customfunction;
let z = 5;

console.log(findSolution(customfunctionAPI, z));
// Example Output: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,2], [4,1]]
```

This code calls the secret function `f(x, y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` in the range [1, 1000] and checks if the result equals `z`. If it does, the pair is added to the result list.
