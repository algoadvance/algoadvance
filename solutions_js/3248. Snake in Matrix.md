[Leetcode 3248. Snake in Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3248)
## Problem Statement

You are given a matrix (2D array) `grid` of size `m x n`. A snake can start from any cell and move in two possible ways:
1. Horizontally to the right (from cell `(i, j)` to cell `(i, j+1)`)
2. Vertically downwards (from cell `(i, j)` to cell `(i+1, j)`)

The snake can collect the number written in each cell through which it passes. Additionally, the snake must always move either strictly right or strictly down, meaning it cannot revisit any cell.

Your task is to compute the maximum sum that can be obtained from a path starting from the top-left cell (cell `(0, 0)`) to the bottom-right cell (cell `(m-1, n-1)`).

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid contain negative numbers?
2. Are the dimensions of the grid always given?
3. Is there a possibility of an empty grid?
4. Can we assume the input is always valid?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Here's how:

1. Create a 2D array `dp` of the same size as `grid` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum sum that can be obtained to reach cell `(i, j)` from `(0, 0)`.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `grid[0][0]`.
3. Fill the first row by cumulative sum because the snake can only move right in this row.
4. Fill the first column by cumulative sum because the snake can only move down in this column.
5. For the rest of the cells, the value in `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum sum obtainable from the top or the left cell plus the current cell value.
6. The result will be stored in `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

## Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maxPathSum(grid) {
    if (grid.length === 0 || grid[0].length === 0) return 0;

    let m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;

    // Create 2D dp array and initialize it
    let dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

    // Fill the first row
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
    }

    // Fill the first column
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
    }

    // Fill the rest of the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j];
        }
    }

    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}

// Example Usage:
let grid = [
    [5, 3, 2, 1],
    [1, 2, 1, 3],
    [1, 8, 1, 1],
    [3, 1, 1, 1]
];
console.log(maxPathSum(grid));  // Outputs: 21
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(m * n)` because we need to fill each cell of the `dp` array by iterating through the `grid`. The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the storage needed for the `dp` array.
