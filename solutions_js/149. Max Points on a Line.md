[Leetcode 149. Max Points on a Line](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l149)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

**Example:**
```
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3

Input: [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the points be negative or zero?**
   - Yes, the coordinates of the points can be any integer, including positive, negative, and zero.

2. **Can multiple points overlap?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate points in the input list.

3. **What is the range of `n` (the number of points)?**
   - The number of points `n` is constrained by \( n \leq 300 \).

### Strategy

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the number of points `n` is less than or equal to 2, then all points are always on the same line. Hence, the result is simply `n`.

2. **Using Slopes:**
   - To find the maximum number of points on the same line, we can use the concept of slope between two points.
   - The slope between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) can be given by \(\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}\).
   - We need to be careful with precision and integer overflow, so representing slopes as a ratio of two integers (`delta_y` / `delta_x`) without simplifying them and considering their gcd can help.
   - Use a dictionary to count the number of points having the same slope with a reference point.

3. **Loop Through Points:**
   - For each point, use it as a reference and calculate slopes with all other points.
   - Keep updating the maximum number of collinear points found.

### Code

```javascript
function maxPoints(points) {
    if (points.length <= 2) return points.length;

    const gcd = (a, b) => b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);

    let maxPointsOnLine = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        let slopes = {};
        let duplicates = 0;
        let verticals = 0;

        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            let [x1, y1] = points[i];
            let [x2, y2] = points[j];

            if (x1 === x2 && y1 === y2) {
                duplicates++;
                continue;
            }

            let deltaX = x2 - x1;
            let deltaY = y2 - y1;

            if (deltaX === 0) {
                verticals++;
                continue;
            }

            let g = gcd(deltaY, deltaX);
            deltaX /= g;
            deltaY /= g;

            let slope = `${deltaY}/${deltaX}`;
            slopes[slope] = (slopes[slope] || 0) + 1;
        }

        let currentMax = verticals;
        for (let slope in slopes) {
            currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, slopes[slope]);
        }

        maxPointsOnLine = Math.max(maxPointsOnLine, currentMax + duplicates + 1);
    }

    return maxPointsOnLine;
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(maxPoints([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])); // Output: 3
console.log(maxPoints([[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]])); // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- We iterate through each pair of points, which leads to a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of points.
- Calculating the GCD and using the dictionary operations contribute to a constant factor time complexity.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).
