[Leetcode 640. Solve the Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l640)
## Problem Statement
Given a string which represents a mathematical equation of the form `ax + b = cx + d`, you need to solve for `x`. The coefficients `a, b, c, and d` are integers. If there are no solutions for `x`, return “No solution”. If there are infinite solutions for `x`, return “Infinite solutions”. If there is exactly one solution for `x`, return the solution as a string in the form `"x=val"` where `val` is the integer solution.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we return for invalid or malformed input?**
   - The problem guarantees well-formed input fitting the `ax + b = cx + d` pattern, so we don't need to handle malformed input cases.
   
2. **How do we handle potential zero coefficients for `x`?**
   - The solution needs to determine if the equation simplifies to a contradiction (e.g., `0 = nonzero number` which means "No solution") or an identity (e.g., `0 = 0` which means "Infinite solutions").
   
## Strategy
1. **Parse the Equation:**
   - Split the equation at the `=` to separate the left side and the right side.
   - Extract coefficients of `x` and constants from both sides.
   
2. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - Combine coefficients of `x` from both sides to form a simplified single-variable equation.
   - Combine constants from both sides.
   
3. **Solve for `x`:**
   - If the combined coefficients of `x` equal to 0 and the constants are equal, return "Infinite solutions".
   - If the combined coefficients of `x` equal to 0 and the constants are not equal, return "No solution".
   - Otherwise, solve for `x` using basic algebra.
   
## Code
```javascript
function solveEquation(equation) {
    let [left, right] = equation.split('=');

    let parseSide = (expr) => {
        let coefX = 0, constTerm = 0, sign = 1, n = expr.length, num = '', hasNum = false;
        
        for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i < n && expr[i] === ' ') continue;
            if (i < n && expr[i] >= '0' && expr[i] <= '9') {
                num += expr[i];
                hasNum = true;
            } else if (i < n && expr[i] === 'x') {
                coefX += sign * (num === '' ? 1 : parseInt(num));
                num = '';
                hasNum = false;
            } else {
                if (hasNum || expr[i] === '-') {
                    constTerm += sign * (num === '' ? 0 : parseInt(num));
                }
                sign = (i < n && expr[i] === '-') ? -1 : 1;
                num = '';
                hasNum = false;
            }
        }
        
        if (num !== '') constTerm += sign * parseInt(num);
        
        return [coefX, constTerm];
    };
    
    let [leftX, leftConst] = parseSide(left);
    let [rightX, rightConst] = parseSide(right);
    
    let totalX = leftX - rightX;
    let totalConst = rightConst - leftConst;
    
    if (totalX === 0) {
        if (totalConst === 0) {
            return "Infinite solutions";
        } else {
            return "No solution";
        }
    } else {
        return "x=" + (totalConst / totalX);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are parsing through the string twice — once for each side of the equation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.
