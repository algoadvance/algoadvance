[Leetcode 518. Coin Change II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l518)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= coins.length <= 300`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`
- All the values of `coins` are unique.
- `0 <= amount <= 5000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the amount be zero?**
   - Yes, if the amount is zero, the number of ways to create that amount is 1 (by choosing no coins).

2. **Are there any constraints on the maximum value of `amount`?**
   - Yes, the amount can be as large as 5000.

3. **Do the coins always have positive values?**
   - Yes, all coin denominations are positive integers.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to use a 1-dimensional DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make the amount `i` using the given coins.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `amount + 1` with all zeros.
   - Set `dp[0]` to 1 because there is one way to make amount zero (by using no coins).

2. **DP State Transition:**
   - For each coin in the `coins` array:
     - Iterate through the `dp` array from the current coin's value up to `amount`.
     - Update `dp[j]` by adding `dp[j - coin]` to it. This is because if you can make `j - coin` amount, you can make `j` amount by adding the current coin to it.

3. **Result:**
   - After processing all the coins, `dp[amount]` will hold the number of ways to make the target amount.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} amount
 * @param {number[]} coins
 * @return {number}
 */
var change = function(amount, coins) {
    let dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    for (let coin of coins) {
        for (let j = coin; j <= amount; j++) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - coin];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[amount];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(amount * n)`, where `n` is the number of coins. This is because we have a nested loop where the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs `amount` times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(amount)`, since we are using a 1-dimensional DP array of size `amount + 1`.

This solution efficiently computes the number of combinations to make up the target amount using dynamic programming.
