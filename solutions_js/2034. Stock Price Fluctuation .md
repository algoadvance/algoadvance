[Leetcode 2034. Stock Price Fluctuation ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2034)
## Problem Statement

You are given a series of timestamped stock prices, and you need to implement a class that supports the following operations:

1. **update(timestamp, price)**: Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp. If there is already a price for this timestamp, it should be overridden.
2. **current()**: Returns the latest price of the stock.
3. **maximum()**: Returns the highest price observed so far.
4. **minimum()**: Returns the lowest price observed so far.

Your task is to design and implement the `StockPrice` class to achieve this functionality.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Will the timestamps always be unique to start with?
   **A:** Yes, each timestamp is unique initially, but an update can override a price at an existing timestamp.

2. **Q:** What are the potential ranges for timestamp and price?
   **A:** Timestamps are integers that increase sequentially and prices are positive integers.

3. **Q:** What is the expected size of the input?
   **A:** We can assume timestamp and price operations are bound by memory constraints typical in an interview setting, i.e., up to 10^5 operations.

## Strategy

1. **update(timestamp, price)**:
   - Use a hash map to store the price for each timestamp.
   - Maintain the latest timestamp to know the current price.
   - Store all prices in a sorted data structure to retrieve max/min efficiently.

2. **current()**:
   - Simply return the price of the latest timestamp.

3. **maximum()**:
   - Retrieve the maximum price from the sorted data structure.

4. **minimum()**:
   - Retrieve the minimum price from the sorted data structure.

### Data Structures:
- `Map` (`timestampToPrice`) to map each timestamp to its price.
- Max-heap and Min-heap to maintain the maximum and minimum prices respectively.
- Inline updates on heaps for adjusted prices to ensure consistent max/min retrieval.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
class StockPrice {
    constructor() {
        this.timestampToPrice = new Map();
        this.maxHeap = new MaxPriorityQueue();  // To store all prices for maximum price retrieval
        this.minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue();  // To store all prices for minimum price retrieval
        this.latestTimestamp = -1;
    }
    
    update(timestamp, price) {
        if (timestamp >= this.latestTimestamp) {
            this.latestTimestamp = timestamp;
        }
        
        if (this.timestampToPrice.has(timestamp)) {
            // Remove old price
            const oldPrice = this.timestampToPrice.get(timestamp);
            this.maxHeap.enqueue({price: -oldPrice, timestamp});
            this.minHeap.enqueue({price: oldPrice, timestamp});
        }

        // Update the new price
        this.timestampToPrice.set(timestamp, price);
        this.maxHeap.enqueue({price: -price, timestamp});
        this.minHeap.enqueue({price, timestamp});
    }
    
    current() {
        return this.timestampToPrice.get(this.latestTimestamp);
    }
    
    maximum() {
        while (true) {
            const {priority, element} = this.maxHeap.front();
            const price = -priority;
            if (this.timestampToPrice.get(element.timestamp) === price) {
                return price;
            }
            this.maxHeap.dequeue();
        }
    }
    
    minimum() {
        while (true) {
            const {priority, element} = this.minHeap.front();
            const price = priority;
            if (this.timestampToPrice.get(element.timestamp) === price) {
                return price;
            }
            this.minHeap.dequeue();
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **update(timestamp, price)**: O(log n) for heap operations.
2. **current()**: O(1) for direct map access.
3. **maximum()**: O(log n) for heap operations until the valid maximum is found.
4. **minimum()**: O(log n) for heap operations until the valid minimum is found.

By using a combination of efficient data structures and lazy deletion (postponing deletions until necessary in max/min operations), we ensure optimal performance for the given constraints.
