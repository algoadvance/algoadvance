[Leetcode 91. Decode Ways](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l91)
## Problem Statement

A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

- "AAJF" (with the split (1 1 10 6))
- "KJF" (with the split (11 10 6))

Note that "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' because "6" is different from "06".

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the **number** of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the invalid leading zero ("06").
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length limit of the input string `s`?**
   - It's not explicitly mentioned but generally, LeetCode problems have reasonable length constraints, typically up to 10^5.

2. **Will the input string `s` only contain digits?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, `s` contains only digits.

3. **Are there any invalid strings (e.g. strings containing characters other than digits)?**
   - No, as per the problem statement, the input will contain only digits (0-9).

## Strategy

To address this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming. We'll define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0..i-1]`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - We can have `dp[0] = 1` because there is one way to decode an empty string.

2. **Recurrence**: 
   - At each position `i`, there are two possible contributions to `dp[i]`:
     - If `s[i-1]` is a valid single digit (i.e., not '0'), then `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.
     - If `s[i-2:i]` is a valid two-digit number (between "10" and "26"), then `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

## Code

```javascript
var numDecodings = function(s) {
    if (s == null || s.length === 0) return 0;

    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // There is one way to decode an empty string

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (s[i - 1] !== '0') {
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
        }
        if (i > 1 && s[i - 2] === '1') {
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
        }
        if (i > 1 && s[i - 2] === '2' && s[i - 1] >= '0' && s[i - 1] <= '6') {
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s` since we are processing each character once.
- **Space complexity**: `O(n)` due to the additional space used for the `dp` array. However, this can be further optimized to `O(1)` space by keeping track of only the last two values of the `dp` array at any time.
