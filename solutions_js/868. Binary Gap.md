[Leetcode 868. Binary Gap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l868)
## Problem Statement

The problem statement for LeetCode 868, Binary Gap, is as follows:

Given a positive integer `n`, find and return the longest distance between any two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of `n`. If there are not two consecutive 1's, return 0.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input**: 
   - Can `n` be any positive integer? 
   - Are there any upper bounds on the value of `n`?

2. **Output**: 
   - What should be returned if there is only one ‘1’ in the binary representation?
   
3. **Examples**:
   - For instance:
     ```
     Input: n = 22 (binary representation = 10110)
     Output: 2
     
     Input: n = 5 (binary representation = 101)
     Output: 2

     Input: n = 8 (binary representation = 1000)
     Output: 0
     ```
   
## Strategy

1. **Convert `n` to Binary**:
   - First, convert `n` into its binary form.
   
2. **Find Indices of '1's**:
   - Traverse through the binary representation and record the indices of all '1's.

3. **Calculate Maximum Gap**:
   - Calculate the gaps between consecutive indices of '1's and return the maximum gap.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the cases where there is less than two '1's in the binary representation by returning 0.

## Code

```javascript
function binaryGap(n) {
    let binary = n.toString(2);
    let maxGap = 0;
    let lastIndex = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < binary.length; i++) {
        if (binary[i] === '1') {
            if (lastIndex !== -1) {
                maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, i - lastIndex);
            }
            lastIndex = i;
        }
    }

    return maxGap;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(binaryGap(22)); // Output: 2
console.log(binaryGap(5));  // Output: 2
console.log(binaryGap(8));  // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Binary**: The conversion of an integer to its binary representation takes \(O(\log n)\) time because the number of bits needed is proportional to the logarithm of `n`.
- **Traversal and Gap Calculation**: We traverse the binary string once, which takes \(O(\log n)\) time as well.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log n)\).
