[Leetcode 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2799)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers. A subarray of an array is called a **complete subarray** if every integer between the minimum and maximum integer present in the array also exist in the subarray.

Given an integer array `nums`, your task is to count the number of complete subarrays within it.

### Example:

```javascript
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,4,3]
Output: 6
```

In this case, the complete subarrays are: `[1,3,2], [1,3,2,1], [3,2,1], [3,2,1,4], [2,1,4,3], [1,4,3]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values in the array? This will help us determine the constraints and edge cases.
2. Can the array contain duplicates? It seems like it should because it's not specified otherwise.
3. Is it guaranteed that the array will have at least one subarray that fulfills the condition?
4. What should be returned if no such subarray exists (edge cases like an empty array)?

## Strategy
The default approach to solving this problem involves iterating over all subarrays and checking if they are "complete."

### Steps:
1. Generate all possible subarrays.
2. For each subarray, check if it contains all integers between its minimum and maximum values.
3. Count the subarrays that meet the criteria and return the count.

### Detailed Plan:
1. Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of complete subarrays.
2. Use nested loops to generate all subarrays.
3. For each subarray determine the minimum and maximum elements.
4. Check if the subarray contains all integers between the found minimum and maximum elements.
5. If it does, increment the counter.
6. Return the count.

### Time Complexity:
- Generating all subarrays would take O(n^2) because there are n(n + 1)/2 subarrays in total.
- Checking each subarray will take O(n) in the worst case.
- The overall complexity is O(n^3) in the worst case, which might be acceptable for small arrays.

## Code
```javascript
function countCompleteSubarrays(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    
    // Helper function to determine if a subarray is complete
    function isCompleteSubarray(subarray) {
        let min = Math.min(...subarray);
        let max = Math.max(...subarray);
        
        for (let i = min; i <= max; i++) {
            if (!subarray.includes(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Generate all subarrays and check if they are complete
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
            let subarray = nums.slice(i, j + 1);
            if (isCompleteSubarray(subarray)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

## Discussion:
This code correctly follows the defined strategy. However, its O(n^3) complexity can be inefficient for large arrays. For larger inputs, we might consider optimization strategies like using sliding windows or pre-processing elements in some fashion. Additional clarifications with the interviewer would help decide if further optimizations are necessary.
