[Leetcode 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l81)
### Problem Statement

You're given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with possible duplicates) that has been rotated at an unknown pivot index. For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`. Given the array `nums` and an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `nums`, or `false` if it is not.

You must minimize the number of comparisons you make.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed with the solution, let's clarify some potential questions:

1. **What should be returned if the `nums` array is empty?**
   - Return `false` if `nums` is empty.
    
2. **Can the `nums` array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the `nums` array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Can the `target` also be a negative number or zero?**
   - Yes, the `target` can be any integer.

4. **Is it guaranteed that `nums` is rotated?**
   - No, it's possible `nums` might not be rotated at all.

### Strategy

We will use a modified binary search to solve this problem efficiently. The strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. **Binary Search with Adjustments for Rotations and Duplicates**: 
   - Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the beginning and end of the array.
   - Perform a binary search:
     - Find the middle element `mid`.
     - Check if `nums[mid]` equals `target`.
     - Handle the case where some elements are the same by skipping duplicates.
     - Determine the sorted half of the array and perform comparisons as appropriate.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function search(nums, target) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return false;

    let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] === target) return true;

        // If we have elements that are same, we need to skip duplicates
        if (nums[left] === nums[mid] && nums[right] === nums[mid]) {
            left++;
            right--;
        } else if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            // Left half is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        } else {
            // Right half is sorted
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is typically `O(log n)` due to the binary search. However, in the worst case when there are many duplicates, the time complexity can degrade to `O(n)`.

- **Best/Average Case**: `O(log n)`, due to the binary search methodology.
- **Worst Case**: `O(n)`, when there are many duplicates that require skipping.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with pointers `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the array.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Calculate `mid`.
   - Check if `target` is at `mid`. If yes, return `true`.
   - Handle duplicates by moving `left` and `right` inwards when they equal `mid`.
   - Determine which half of the array is sorted:
     - If the left half (`nums[left] <= nums[mid]`) is sorted:
       - Check if `target` falls within this range; adjust `left` and `right` accordingly.
     - Else, the right half is sorted:
       - Check if `target` falls within this range; adjust `left` and `right` accordingly.
3. **Conclusion**: If the loop exits without finding the `target`, return `false`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the search in a potentially rotated and duplicate-containing sorted array.
