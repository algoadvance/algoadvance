[Leetcode 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1503)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and two integer arrays `left` and `right`. `n` represents the length of a plank, and the arrays `left` and `right` represent the positions of ants moving to the left and right, respectively. Each position is an integer on the plank.

When two ants meet at some point, they will bounce off each other and continue moving in their original direction. Even though they bounce, we can consider this as two ants swapping their directions, and hence the result remains the same as if they passed through each other without bouncing.

Ants keep walking until they fall off the plank. Return the moment when the last ant(s) fall off the plank.

**Example**
```
Input: n = 4, left = [4,3], right = [0,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the worst case, the ant at position 4 will take 4 seconds to fall off the plank.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Does the plank number start from 0 to n or 1 to n?
   **A:** The plank number starts from 0 to n.
   
2. **Q:** Are left and right arrays disjoint?
   **A:** Yes, they are disjoint. No ant can be in both the `left` and `right` arrays.

3. **Q:** What is the minimum and maximum value for `n`?
   **A:** The minimum value for `n` is 1 and can be assumed to be within practical limits for computations.

### Strategy

1. **Ants on the Left:** For ants moving to the left, we need to find the maximum value in the `left` array since this ant will take the longest time to exit from the left end.
2. **Ants on the Right:** For ants moving to the right, we need to find the minimum value in the `right` array since this ant will take the longest time to exit from the right end (by travelling the entire length `n`).

The result will be the maximum of:
- The maximum time an ant from `left` array takes to fall off (which is just the value of the maximum element in `left` array).
- The maximum time an ant from `right` array takes to fall off (which is `n -` the value of the minimum element in `right` array).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[]} left
 * @param {number[]} right
 * @return {number}
 */
var getLastMoment = function(n, left, right) {
    // Calculate maximum time for ants on the left to fall off the plank
    let maxLeft = left.length > 0 ? Math.max(...left) : 0;
    
    // Calculate maximum time for ants on the right to fall off the plank
    let maxRight = right.length > 0 ? n - Math.min(...right) : 0;

    // The last moment before all ants fall out is the maximum of these two times.
    return Math.max(maxLeft, maxRight);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Finding the maximum in the `left` array takes O(L) where L is the number of elements in `left`.
- Finding the minimum in the `right` array takes O(R) where R is the number of elements in `right`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(L + R), which is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
