[Leetcode 831. Masking Personal Information](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l831)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to write a function that takes a string that contains either a name or an email address and returns a masked version of that input as follows:

1. **Name**:
    - You will mask all characters in the name except for the first letter and the last letter.
    - Case should be ignored when masking and outputting the name.
    - A name will only contain alphabetic characters and spaces and be at least 2 characters long.
    - Example: `LeetCode` -> `L*****e`

2. **Email**:
    - You will mask all characters of the local part of the email address except for the first and last character.
    - The domain part should remain as is, except that it should be all in lowercase.
    - The 'local' and 'domain' parts are separated by the '@' character.
    - Example: `example@domain.com` -> `e*****e@domain.com`

3. **Phone Number**:
    - You will mask all digits except for the last four.
    - Country code should be handled appropriately if there are more than 10 digits.
    - Only digits, spaces, dashes, plus signs, and parentheses are allowed in the phone number.
    - Remove any non-numeric characters before masking.
    - Examples:
        - `"1(234)567-890"` -> `***-***-7890`
        - `"86-(10)12345678"` -> `+**-***-***-5678`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. How to interpret spaces in names - should they be masked as well?
2. Are the input strings always valid, or do we need to handle invalid input?
3. For phone numbers, in what format should the output be if there are any country codes?

Let's assume we handle all necessary inputs based on given rules. The function will determine if the input is an email, name, or phone number based on the allowed characters in each type.

## Code:

```javascript
function maskPII(S) {
    if (S.includes("@")) {
        // Mask email
        return maskEmail(S);
    } else if (/\d/.test(S)) {
        // Mask phone
        return maskPhone(S);
    } else {
        // Mask name
        return maskName(S);
    }
}

function maskEmail(email) {
    let [local, domain] = email.toLowerCase().split('@');
    local = local[0] + "*****" + local[local.length - 1];
    return local + "@" + domain;
}

function maskPhone(phone) {
    let digits = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
    let masked = "***-***-" + digits.slice(-4);
    let countryLength = digits.length - 10;
    if (countryLength > 0) {
        masked = "+" + "*".repeat(countryLength) + "-" + masked;
    }
    return masked;
}

function maskName(name) {
    name = name.trim().toLowerCase();
    if (name.length <= 2) return name.toUpperCase();
    return name[0].toUpperCase() + "*".repeat(name.length - 2) + name[name.length - 1].toLowerCase();
}
```

## Strategy:

1. **Check for Email**:
    - If the string contains '@', consider it an email.
    - Convert all characters to lowercase.
    - Mask all characters in the local part, except the first and the last.
  
2. **Check for Phone Number**:
    - If the string contains a digit, consider it a phone number.
    - Remove all non-digit characters.
    - Mask all digits except the last 4.
    - Handle country code if there are more than 10 digits.

3. **Name Masking**:
    - Assume all strings otherwise are names.
    - Convert the name to lowercase.
    - Mask all characters except for the first and last and capitalize the first letter.

## Time Complexity:

- **maskPII(S)**: O(1) to switch between type check.
- **maskEmail(email)**: O(n) where n is the length of the local part.
- **maskPhone(phone)**: O(m) where m is the length of the phone number.
- **maskName(name)**: O(k) where k is the length of the name.

The overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of characters in the longest input string.
