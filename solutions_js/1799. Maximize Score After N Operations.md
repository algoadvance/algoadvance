[Leetcode 1799. Maximize Score After N Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1799)
## Problem Statement

You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations on this array.

In the `i-th` operation (1-indexed), you will:

1. Choose two elements, `x` and `y` from `nums`.
2. Receive a score of `i * gcd(x, y)`.
3. Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.

Your task is to maximize the total score after `n` operations.

Return the maximum score you can receive after performing `n` operations.

### Example:

```text
Input: nums = [1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The optimal choice is to use the pair (1, 2) in the first operation.

Input: nums = [3, 4, 6, 8]
Output: 11
Explanation: The optimal choice is to use (4, 6) in the first operation to get a score of 1 * gcd(4, 6) = 2. 
Then use (3, 8) in the second operation to get a score of 2 * gcd(3, 8) = 1. The total score is 2 + 9 = 11.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 14
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 7`
- `nums.length == 2 * n`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can elements be reused for multiple operations?
   - No, once used, elements are removed from the array.
2. What is the range of the values within `nums`?
   - From 1 to \(10^6\), as per the constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to use dynamic programming combined with bitwise operations to efficiently track subsets of the numbers and their scores:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - Use a memoization technique to store results of subproblems.
   - Use a bitmask to represent the state of the `nums` array (each bit corresponds to whether a number is used or not).
   
2. **State Representation**:
   - Use an integer where each bit indicates if a particular number in `nums` is used or not.
   
3. **Transition**:
   - For each state, try to select two different numbers that are still available (not used).
   - Calculate the score if we pair these two numbers and move to the next state.

4. **Bitmasking**:
   - Use a bitmask of length `2*n` (since there are `2*n` numbers).
   - Each bit in the bitmask indicates whether the corresponding number in `nums` has been used.

5. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - Define a DP function that computes the maximum score for a given bitmask state.
   - For each valid pair of indices, update the state by marking these indices as used and recursively get the score for the reduced problem.

This solution ensures we explore only feasible combinations of pairs efficiently using bitmasking and dynamic programming.

### Time Complexity
This approach ensures that we handle `O(2^(2*n))` states efficiently, and for each state, evaluate `O((2*n)^2)` pairs leading to an overall complexity of `O((2*n)^2 * 2^(2*n))`.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code to implement the above strategy:

```javascript
const gcd = (a, b) => b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);

const maxScore = (nums) => {
    const n = nums.length / 2;
    const dp = new Array(1 << (2 * n)).fill(0);
    
    const findMaxScore = (mask, operation) => {
        if (dp[mask] !== 0) return dp[mask];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) !== 0) continue;
            for (let j = i + 1; j < 2 * n; j++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) !== 0) continue;
                
                let newMask = mask | (1 << i) | (1 << j);
                let score = operation * gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) + findMaxScore(newMask, operation + 1);
                
                dp[mask] = Math.max(dp[mask], score);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[mask];
    };
    
    return findMaxScore(0, 1);
};

// Examples
console.log(maxScore([1, 2])); // Output: 1
console.log(maxScore([3, 4, 6, 8])); // Output: 11
console.log(maxScore([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); // Output: 14
```

In the above code:

- `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor.
- `dp` array is used to store maximum scores for different bitmask states.
- `findMaxScore` recursively finds the best score for a given state.

This efficient approach ensures maximum scores are computed correctly by exploring feasible pairs using dynamic programming with bitmasking.
