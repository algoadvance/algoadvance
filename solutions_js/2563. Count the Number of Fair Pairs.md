[Leetcode 2563. Count the Number of Fair Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2563)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`. A pair `(i, j)` is called fair if `i < j` and `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`.

Return the number of fair pairs.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input array sorted? 
   - No, the array can be in any order.
2. Can `nums` contain negative elements?
   - Yes, the array `nums` can contain negative, zero, and positive integers.
3. What are the constraints?
   - You can expect `nums.length` to be as large as 10^5.
   - The values of `nums[i]`, `lower`, and `upper` can be between -10^9 and 10^9.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array `nums`. This allows us to use a two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Use Two-Pointer Technique**: Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array. We will move these pointers to find pairs that satisfy the condition.
3. **Count Fair Pairs**: For every element at index `i`, count the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` using the sliding window (or two-pointer) approach.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Sorting**: Sort the array to simplify the two-pointer approach.
2. **Nested Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each element in the array.
   - The inner loop (using two pointers) will find and count valid fair pairs `(i, j)` for the current `i`.
   
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: For every `i`, use two pointers to find the range of indices `j` such that `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`.

## Code

```javascript
var countFairPairs = function(nums, lower, upper) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);  // Sort the array
    let n = nums.length;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        let start = i + 1;
        let end = n;
        
        // Find the left bound using binary search
        while (start < end) {
            let mid = start + Math.floor((end - start) / 2);
            if (nums[i] + nums[mid] < lower) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        let leftBound = start;  // Lower bound for `j`
        
        start = i + 1;
        end = n;
        
        // Find the right bound using binary search
        while (start < end) {
            let mid = start + Math.floor((end - start) / 2);
            if (nums[i] + nums[mid] <= upper) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        let rightBound = start;  // Upper bound for `j`
        
        count += rightBound - leftBound;
    }
    
    return count;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
2. **Counting Pairs**: Each pair is found and checked in `O(log n)` time using binary search for a total of `O(n log n)` for the nested loop.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` for sorting + `O(n log n)` for counting pairs = `O(n log n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` extra space, assuming the sorting algorithm is in-place.

With this strategy, the solution should efficiently handle the largest input sizes stipulated by the problem constraints.
