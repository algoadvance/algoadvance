[Leetcode 1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1953)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `milestones` where each element represents the number of units of work required for different projects. Your task is to maximize the number of weeks in which you work on these projects, subject to the following rules:
1. You can work on the projects over consecutive weeks.
2. In each week, you can choose to work on exactly one project for one full unit of work.
3. You cannot work on the same project two weeks in a row.

Return the maximum number of weeks that you can work, while adhering to these rules.

### Example
1. Input: `milestones = [1, 2, 3]`
   Output: `6`

2. Input: `milestones = [5, 2, 1]`
   Output: `7`

### Constraints
- `n == milestones.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= milestones[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the milestones array contain negative numbers? 
   - No, the milestones array contains only positive integers.
2. Can we work on multiple projects in the same week?
   - No, you can only work on one project per week.
3. Are we guaranteed to achieve at least one week of work?
   - Yes, since all milestones are positive.

## Strategy
The primary task is to determine how to maximize the number of weeks you can work on the projects without working on the same project in consecutive weeks.

### Approach
1. Calculate the total sum of all the milestones.
2. Find the maximum value in the milestones array.
3. To ensure that you don't work on the same project for consecutive weeks, the sum of the other milestones (excluding the maximum one) should be greater than or equal to the maximum milestone. If it's not, you will be limited by how many times you can switch between the max milestone and others.
4. The answer is min(sum of milestones, 2*(sum of other milestones) + 1).

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfWeeks(milestones) {
    let totalSum = milestones.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    let maxMilestone = Math.max(...milestones);

    if (2 * maxMilestone <= totalSum) {
        return totalSum;
    } else {
        return 2 * (totalSum - maxMilestone) + 1;
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(numberOfWeeks([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 6
console.log(numberOfWeeks([5, 2, 1])); // Output: 7
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of projects (elements in the milestones array):
1. Calculating the total sum of milestones: O(n).
2. Finding the maximum milestone: O(n).

Given these operations are performed consecutively, the overall time complexity remains O(n).
