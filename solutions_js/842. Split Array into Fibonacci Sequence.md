[Leetcode 842. Split Array into Fibonacci Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l842)
### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to split a given string into a Fibonacci-like sequence. A sequence is Fibonacci-like if it consists of at least three integers and each integer (starting from the third) is the sum of the two preceding ones. Moreover, the integers must not have leading zeros, except if the integer itself is `0`.

You need to return any valid Fibonacci-like sequence in the form of a list of integers. If no such sequence exists, return an empty list.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are some clarifications:
1. **Can the input string be empty?**
    - No, the problem guarantees a non-empty string.
2. **What is the maximum length for the input string?**
    - The length of the string is at most 200 characters.
3. **What should we return if there are multiple valid solutions?**
    - Any valid Fibonacci-like sequence will be accepted.
4. **What if the chosen numbers are very large?**
    - Each integer in the sequence must fit within a 32-bit signed integer, i.e., in the range from `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1` (though only positive values are relevant here).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through possible splits**: We'll use three nested loops to try different combinations of starting splits.
2. **Check for valid Fibonacci sequence**: For each split, we'll check if the remaining part of the string can be split further to form a valid Fibonacci sequence.
3. **Avoid leading zeros**: We must ensure numbers do not have leading zeros.
4. **Handle large numbers**: Ensure numbers conform to the 32-bit integer constraint.

We'll attempt to start the sequence by selecting the first two numbers in different possible ways and check if they can lead to a valid sequence.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation of the solution:

```javascript
var splitIntoFibonacci = function(S) {
    const MAX_INT = 2 ** 31 - 1;

    const isValidPart = (s) => {
        if (s.length > 1 && s[0] === '0') return false;
        return Number(s) <= MAX_INT;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(10, S.length - 2); i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= i + Math.min(10, S.length - i - 1); j++) {
            let num1 = S.substring(0, i);
            let num2 = S.substring(i, j);

            if (!isValidPart(num1) || !isValidPart(num2)) continue;

            let fibSeq = [parseInt(num1), parseInt(num2)];
            let k = j;

            while (k < S.length) {
                let nextNum = `${fibSeq[fibSeq.length - 1] + fibSeq[fibSeq.length - 2]}`;
                if (S.startsWith(nextNum, k)) {
                    k += nextNum.length;
                    fibSeq.push(parseInt(nextNum));
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (k === S.length && fibSeq.length >= 3) {
                return fibSeq;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return [];
};
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Outer Loops**: We use nested loops to determine starting points for the first and second numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
2. **Validation**: We check that the chosen parts (`num1`, `num2`) do not have leading zeros and are within 32-bit integer bounds.
3. **Sequence Formation**: We form the Fibonacci sequence by adding the last two numbers and checking if the resulting sum matches the next part of the string.
4. **Return Condition**: If a valid sequence spans the entire string and has at least three numbers, it's returned; otherwise, we continue searching.

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n) if a valid sequence is found early.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^3) due to three nested loops attempting different splits and checks. Here, `n` is the length of the input string.

This approach ensures we efficiently try possible splits while adhering to constraints, and it uses string operations to validate and form sequences appropriately.
