[Leetcode 1507. Reformat Date](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1507)
### Problem Statement

1507. Reformat Date

Given a date string in the form `Day Month Year`, where:
- Day is a numeric day with a suffix ("st", "nd", "rd", "th") (1 to 31)
- Month is a capitalized three-letter abbreviation of the month's name (e.g., "Jan", "Feb", etc.)
- Year is a four-digit number (e.g., "2020", "1998").

Your task is to reformat this date string into the ISO 8601 format, which is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Example:
```
Input: "20th Oct 2052"
Output: "2052-10-20"

Input: "6th Jun 1933"
Output: "1933-06-06"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size/Constraints:** What is the maximum length of the input string?
2. **Date Validity:** Can we assume all input strings will be valid dates within the specified format?
3. **Edge Cases:** Are there any specific edge cases we should be aware of (e.g., leap years, different input formatting)?

Assuming that the input strings are always correctly formatted as per the problem statement and within a valid date range in the Gregorian calendar.

### Strategy

1. **Extract Day, Month, and Year:** Use string manipulation to separate the components of the date.
2. **Map Month Abbreviation to Number:** Use a dictionary to map the month abbreviations to their respective numeric values.
3. **Format Components:** Ensure that the day and month are two digits by prefixing with a zero if necessary.
4. **Combine Components:** Construct the ISO 8601 date string using the extracted and formatted components.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function reformatDate(date) {
    const months = {
        "Jan": "01", "Feb": "02", "Mar": "03", "Apr": "04", "May": "05", "Jun": "06",
        "Jul": "07", "Aug": "08", "Sep": "09", "Oct": "10", "Nov": "11", "Dec": "12"
    };

    let [day, month, year] = date.split(" ");

    // Remove suffix from day
    day = day.slice(0, -2);
    if (day.length === 1) {
        day = '0' + day;
    }

    month = months[month];

    return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}

// Example usage
console.log(reformatDate("20th Oct 2052")); // "2052-10-20"
console.log(reformatDate("6th Jun 1933"));  // "1933-06-06"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) (constant time):
- The operations performed: splitting the input string, slicing and padding the day, and looking up the month in a predefined dictionary, all take constant time.

### Explanation

1. **Splitting the Input:** `date.split(" ")` splits the input string into an array containing day, month, and year.
2. **Processing the Day:** `day.slice(0, -2)` removes the last two characters (the suffix) from the day string.
   - If the day string's length is 1, it adds a leading zero to ensure it becomes two digits.
3. **Mapping Month to Number:** The `months` dictionary converts month abbreviations to their respective two-digit numbers.
4. **Formatting and Returning:** The function then constructs the ISO 8601 formatted date string and returns it.
