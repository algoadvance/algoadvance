[Leetcode 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2125)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix `bank` representing the layout of a bank, where each cell in the matrix contains either a '1' or a '0'. A '1' denotes the presence of a security device and a '0' denotes empty space. A laser beam can travel between two security devices if they are in the same row or the same column without encountering another device in between. Your task is to return the total number of laser beams in the bank.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Diagonal Laser Paths:** Are diagonal laser paths considered?
   - No, only horizontal and vertical paths are considered.

2. **Input Characteristics:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the matrix?
     - The matrix can have up to 1000 rows and 1000 columns.
   - Is there a minimum number of rows and columns?
     - No, but the matrix may be empty.

3. **Multiple Beams:** If multiple devices exist in a row/column, how are the beams counted?
   - For every adjacent pair of '1's in a row/column, one laser beam can be formed.

### Strategy

1. **Row-wise Beam Calculation:**
   - Count the number of devices (`1`) in each row.
   - For each pair of consecutive rows that have at least one device, the number of beams between them is the product of the count of devices in these rows.

2. **Column-wise Beam Calculation:**
   - We don't need to separately count beams column-wise if we account for all devices and beam possibilities while processing rows.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfBeams(bank) {
    let deviceCounts = [];
    
    // Loop through each row and find the number of devices
    for (let i = 0; i < bank.length; i++) {
        let count = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < bank[i].length; j++) {
            if (bank[i][j] === '1') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count > 0) {
            deviceCounts.push(count);
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the total number of beams
    let totalBeams = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < deviceCounts.length - 1; i++) {
        totalBeams += deviceCounts[i] * deviceCounts[i+1];
    }
    
    return totalBeams;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Row Processing:**
    - Traverse each row to count the number of devices (`1`).
    - Collect these counts into a list (`deviceCounts`).

2. **Beam Calculation:**
    - Calculate the beams by multiplying the device counts of consecutive non-empty rows.
    - Sum these products to get the total number of beams.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We scan each cell once to count devices.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of rows, for storing non-zero device counts.

This solution effectively computes the desired result while adhering to the constraints and limits given in the problem statement.
