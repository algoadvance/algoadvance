[Leetcode 2585. Number of Ways to Earn Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2585)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a list of integers representing different point values of coins, and an integer `target` representing the total points required. Calculate the number of distinct ways to earn exactly `target` points using any combination of the given coins. Given that there can be multiple ways to form the desired target using different combinations, return the total number of such combinations.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the point values and target guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   Yes, they are guaranteed to be non-negative.

2. **Is it possible to use each coin value more than once in forming combinations?**
   Yes, we can use each coin value any number of times.

3. **What should we return if no combination can form the target value?**
   If no combination can form the target value, we should return 0.

4. **Is there an upper limit on the number of coins or the size of the target?**
   For large `target` values and large lists of coin points, we need an efficient solution.

### Strategy:

This is a classic problem that can be solved using dynamic programming, specifically a variation of the Coin Change Problem (more akin to the "Change-making problem (unbounded)"). The idea is to use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to get exactly `i` points using the given coin values.

1. **Initialize DP Array:**
   - Create an array `dp` of size `target + 1`, initialized to 0.
   - Set `dp[0] = 1` because there's one way to make zero points, which is to use no coins.

2. **Fill DP Array:**
   - For each coin value, iterate through the `dp` array and update the number of ways to form each possible total up to `target`.

3. **Result:**
   - The number of ways to earn exactly `target` points will be found at `dp[target]`.

### Code:

```javascript
var waysToEarnPoints = function (points, target) {
    // Initialize dp array with size of target + 1, filled with 0's
    let dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(0);
    
    // There's one way to make a total of 0 points: use no coins at all
    dp[0] = 1;
    
    // Fill the dp array
    for (let coin of points) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= target; i++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
        }
    }
    
    // Answer is the number of ways to get exactly target points
    return dp[target];
};

// Example usage
let points = [1, 2, 3];
let target = 4;
console.log(waysToEarnPoints(points, target));  // Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times t)\), where \(n\) is the number of coins (length of `points` array) and \(t\) is the `target` value. This is because we iterate through each coin and for each coin, we iterate through the possible targets up to the given target value.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is \(O(t)\) for the dynamic programming array `dp` of size \(target + 1\).

This dynamic programming approach effectively and efficiently counts the number of ways to achieve the `target` using the given coins.
