[Leetcode 2719. Count of Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2719)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the number of integers in the range `[num1, num2]` inclusive.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `num1` and `num2` always non-negative integers?**
   - The problem doesn't specify any constraints on the nature of `num1` and `num2`. Let's assume they can be any integers, unless otherwise specified.

2. **Should we consider the range to be inclusive?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that the range is inclusive.

3. **How large can `num1` and `num2` be?**
   - This information isn't provided, so we'll assume typical constraints that `num1` and `num2` fit within standard integer limits in JavaScript.

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to count the total number of integers between `num1` and `num2`, inclusive.

2. **Formulate the Solution:**
   - If `num1` â‰¤ `num2`, the count of integers between them is straightforward: it's just `num2 - num1 + 1`.
   - If `num1` > `num2`, we need to return `0` since the range would be invalid.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that if `num1` is equal to `num2`, the result should be `1`.
   - Handle negative ranges correctly if applicable.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num1
 * @param {number} num2
 * @return {number}
 */
function countOfIntegers(num1, num2) {
    if (num1 > num2) {
        return 0; // If num1 is greater than num2, there are no integers in the range
    }
    return num2 - num1 + 1;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(countOfIntegers(1, 5)); // Output: 5
console.log(countOfIntegers(5, 5)); // Output: 1
console.log(countOfIntegers(10, 5)); // Output: 0
console.log(countOfIntegers(-2, 2)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is **O(1)** because it only involves basic arithmetic operations which are performed in constant time.
