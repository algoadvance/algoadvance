[Leetcode 2272. Substring With Largest Variance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2272)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the substring with the largest variance. The variance of a substring is defined as the difference between the number of occurrences of the maximum frequent character and the minimum frequent character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Characters in String:** Does the string consist of only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the string consists of only lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Empty String:** What should be the output if an empty string is provided?
   - The variance of an empty string should be `0`.

3. **Single Character String:** What should be the output if the string has only one unique character?
   - The variance should be `0` as there's no difference in frequency between different characters.

### Strategy

The main idea is to use a modified version of Kadane's Algorithm, which is used for finding the maximum sum subarray. We change the problem to find the maximum difference between two kinds of characters in the string.

1. **Iterate through all pairs of characters:** Given that the string has at most 26 unique characters, we can iterate through all pairs `(a, b)` of characters where `a` and `b` are different.
2. **Track Frequencies:** For each pair `(a, b)`, traverse the string and use a variant of Kadane's algorithm to track the difference in counts of `a` and `b`.
3. **Kadane's Algorithm Application:** We treat the problem as finding the maximum difference in counts where:
   - Increment count when `a` is encountered.
   - Decrement count when `b` is encountered.
   - Reset if the difference drops below zero and both `a` and `b` have been counted.
4. **Update Maximum Variance:** Track the maximum variance encountered during these traversals.

### Code

```javascript
function largestVariance(s) {
    const charSet = new Set(s);
    const chars = Array.from(charSet);

    let maxVariance = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
            if (i === j) continue;

            let char1 = chars[i];
            let char2 = chars[j];

            let count1 = 0;
            let count2 = 0;
            let hasChar1 = false;
            let hasChar2 = false;
            let currentMax = 0;

            for (let k = 0; k < s.length; k++) {
                if (s[k] === char1) {
                    count1++;
                    hasChar1 = true;
                } else if (s[k] === char2) {
                    count2++;
                    hasChar2 = true;
                }

                if (hasChar1 && hasChar2) {
                    currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, count1 - count2);
                }

                if (count1 < count2) {
                    count1 = 0;
                    count2 = 0;
                    hasChar1 = false;
                    hasChar2 = false;
                }
            }

            maxVariance = Math.max(maxVariance, currentMax);
        }
    }

    return maxVariance;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(largestVariance("aababbb"));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loops:** Both loops iterate through pairs of characters (26 * 26 = 676 pairs).
- **Inner Loop:** For each pair, we traverse the string `s` once.
- The overall time complexity is \(O(676 \cdot n) = O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the string.

Thus, this solution is efficient given the constraints.
