[Leetcode 836. Rectangle Overlap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l836)
### Problem Statement:

836. Rectangle Overlap

You are given two rectangles on a 2D plane. The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (x1, y1) and its top-right corner (x2, y2). The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (x3, y3) and its top-right corner (x4, y4).

Determine if the two rectangles overlap. Rectangles overlap when:
1. One rectangleâ€™s interior is fully or partially inside the other rectangle or
2. They are exactly the same.

Return `true` if the rectangles overlap, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Coordinates:** Are all coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4) integers?
   - Yes, all coordinates are integers.
2. **Axis Alignment:** Are the rectangles always axis-aligned?
   - Yes, the sides of the rectangles are always parallel to the x or y axis.
3. **Inclusive Boundaries:** Do the boundaries count as overlapping?
   - No, touching boundaries do not count as overlapping.

### Strategy:

- To determine if two rectangles overlap, we can consider the conditions under which they do not overlap.
- Specifically, two rectangles do not overlap if:
  - One rectangle is completely to the left of the other.
  - One rectangle is completely to the right of the other.
  - One rectangle is completely above the other.
  - One rectangle is completely below the other.
  
Using these conditions, we can derive that rectangles overlap in all other cases.

### Code:

```javascript
function isRectangleOverlap(rec1, rec2) {
    // Extract the coordinates from the rectangle arrays
    const [x1, y1, x2, y2] = rec1;
    const [x3, y3, x4, y4] = rec2;
    
    // Check for non-overlapping conditions
    const noOverlap = x2 <= x3 || x4 <= x1 || y2 <= y3 || y4 <= y1;
    
    // Rectangles overlap if none of the non-overlapping conditions are met
    return !noOverlap;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isRectangleOverlap([0,0,2,2], [1,1,3,3])); // true
console.log(isRectangleOverlap([0,0,1,1], [1,0,2,1])); // false
```

### Explanation:

- **Step 1:** Extract the coordinates for both rectangles.
- **Step 2:** Check if one rectangle is to the left, right, above, or below the other by comparing their coordinates.
- **Step 3:** If any of these conditions for non-overlap hold true, return `false`.
- **Step 4:** If none of the non-overlap conditions is satisfied, return `true` because the rectangles must overlap.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because it involves a constant number of arithmetic and logical operations regardless of the input size.

This approach efficiently determines rectangle overlap using comparisons, ensuring optimal performance.
