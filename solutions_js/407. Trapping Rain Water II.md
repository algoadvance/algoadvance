[Leetcode 407. Trapping Rain Water II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l407)
Sure, let's solve the "Trapping Rain Water II" problem on LeetCode. I'll guide you through the process step by step.

### Problem Statement
Given an m x n integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of rainwater it can trap after raining.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I assume the dimensions of the matrix (m and n) will be non-zero?**
   - Yes, we can assume the heightMap grid dimensions are non-zero.
   
2. **Can the heights of the terrain cells be negative?**
   - No, the heights in the `heightMap` will be non-negative integers.
   
3. **Is the boundary of the given grid considered in trapping water?**
   - No, the boundary cells cannot trap any water as they allow water to flow out.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) and a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to simulate how water is trapped between the cells. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize the Min-Heap**: Push all the boundary cells into the Min-Heap.
2. **Mark the boundary cells as visited**: Use a visited array to keep track of visited cells.
3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - While the heap is not empty, extract the minimum height cell.
   - Check all its 4-neighbouring cells (up, down, left, right).
   - For each neighboring cell, if it's not visited, calculate the water it can trap and update the water volume.
   - Push the neighboring cell into the heap with the updated height (maximum of current cell height and neighbor's height).
   - Mark the neighboring cell as visited.
   
### Code
Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function trapRainWater(heightMap) {
    if (!heightMap || heightMap.length === 0 || heightMap[0].length === 0) return 0;
    
    const m = heightMap.length;
    const n = heightMap[0].length;
    
    const dirs = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
    
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({ compare: (a, b) => a.height - b.height });

    // Add all boundary cells to the Min-Heap and mark them as visited
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i === 0 || j === 0 || i === m - 1 || j === n - 1) {
                minHeap.enqueue({ row: i, col: j, height: heightMap[i][j] });
                visited[i][j] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    let trappedWater = 0;
    
    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
        const cell = minHeap.dequeue();
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of dirs) {
            const newRow = cell.row + dx;
            const newCol = cell.col + dy;
            
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                
                trappedWater += Math.max(0, cell.height - heightMap[newRow][newCol]);
                
                minHeap.enqueue({ 
                    row: newRow, 
                    col: newCol, 
                    height: Math.max(cell.height, heightMap[newRow][newCol]) 
                });
            }
        }
    }

    return trappedWater;
}

// Utility class for Min Heap Priority Queue
class MinPriorityQueue {
    constructor({ compare }) {
        this.queue = [];
        this.compare = compare;
    }
    
    enqueue(element) {
        this.queue.push(element);
        this.queue.sort(this.compare);
    }
    
    dequeue() {
        return this.queue.shift();
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.queue.length === 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. The log factor comes from the operations in the priority queue (heap). The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the storage of the visited matrix and the priority queue elements.

This solution ensures that we efficiently calculate the trapped water using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
