[Leetcode 2103. Rings and Rods](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2103)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `rings` representing the rings placed onto rods. Each character in `rings` will be either 'R', 'G', or 'B' (representing Red, Green, and Blue rings respectively), or a digit from '0' to '9' representing the rod on which the ring is placed.

For example: "B0R0G0R9G9B9" means that a Blue ring was placed on rod 0, a Red ring was placed on rod 0, a Green ring was placed on rod 0, a Red ring was placed on rod 9, and so on.

Your task is to return the number of rods that have all three colors of rings on them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can each rod have multiple rings of the same color?
   - Yes, a rod can have multiple rings of the same color.
   
2. Are there any specific constraints on the input string, like its maximum length?
   - The constraints typically follow what is standard for LeetCode problems, but we'll assume a reasonable limit, such as the length of the string being up to 10^4.

### Strategy

1. Create an object to store the set of colors each rod has.
2. Iterate over the string `rings` in steps of 2 and update our object with the color for the respective rod.
3. Check the total number of unique rods that have all three rings ('R', 'G', and 'B').
4. Return this count.

### Code

```javascript
function countPoints(rings) {
    // Object to store the sets of colors for each rod
    const rods = {};

    // Iterate over the rings string
    for (let i = 0; i < rings.length; i += 2) {
        const color = rings[i];
        const rod = rings[i + 1];

        // If the rod isn't already in our map, initialize it with a new Set
        if (!rods[rod]) {
            rods[rod] = new Set();
        }
        
        // Add the color to the set of the corresponding rod
        rods[rod].add(color);
    }

    // Count the number of rods that have all three colors
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let rod in rods) {
        if (rods[rod].size === 3) {
            result += 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```
### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate over the string once.
   
2. **Space Complexity**: O(1), assuming the number of rods (0 through 9) is constant and limited. The space used by the colors sets can be considered constant since they are limited to three items per rod.

This solution efficiently keeps track of the different colors on each rod and counts the number of rods with all three colors in linear time.
