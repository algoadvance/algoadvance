[Leetcode 44. Wildcard Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l44)
## Problem Statement:

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

- `'?'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

### Example:

1. `Input: s = "aa", p = "a"`
   - Output: `false`
2. `Input: s = "aa", p = "*"`
   - Output: `true`
3. `Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"`
   - Output: `false`
4. `Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"`
   - Output: `true`
5. `Input: s = "acdcb", p = "a*c?b"`
   - Output: `false`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Is the input string and pattern limited in length?
2. Are there any constraints on the character set of `s` and `p`?

For the sake of this problem, let's assume:
- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `?`, and `*`.

## Strategy:

We'll use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. Let `dp[i][j]` be `true` if the first `i` characters in the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.

### Steps:

1. Initialize a DP table with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`. Set `dp[0][0]` to `true` since an empty pattern matches an empty string.
2. Fill the first row `dp[0][j]`, which represents matching an empty string `s` with the pattern `p`. It should be `true` if the pattern `p` up to `j` is made of only `'*'`.
3. Populate the DP table by iterating over each character in `s` and `p`:
   - If the characters match, or the pattern character is `'?'`, then follow the diagonal value `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If the pattern character is an `'*'`, it can match zero or more characters. Hence, `dp[i][j]` can be `dp[i-1][j]` (considering '*' matches current character and we move on s) or `dp[i][j-1]` (considering '*' matches zero characters and we move on p).

### Code:

```javascript
function isMatch(s, p) {
    const m = s.length;
    const n = p.length;
    const dp = Array(m + 1).fill(false).map(() => Array(n + 1).fill(false));

    dp[0][0] = true; // Empty pattern matches empty string

    // Fill first row for patterns like *, **, ***, etc.
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1];
        }
    }

    // Fill the DP table
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (p[j - 1] === '?' || p[j - 1] === s[i - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

// Sample test cases
console.log(isMatch("aa", "a")); // false
console.log(isMatch("aa", "*")); // true
console.log(isMatch("cb", "?a")); // false
console.log(isMatch("adceb", "*a*b")); // true
console.log(isMatch("acdcb", "a*c?b")); // false
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the length of the string `s` and `n` is the length of the pattern `p`. This is because we fill an \(m \times n\) table in a nested loop.

The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the DP table that we created.
