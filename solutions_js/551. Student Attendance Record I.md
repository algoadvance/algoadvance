### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem: **551. Student Attendance Record I**

You are given a string representing a student's attendance record for a semester. The record contains only the following three characters:
- 'A' : Absent
- 'L' : Late
- 'P' : Present

A student could be rewarded if their attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).

Return `true` if the student could be rewarded according to their attendance record, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the attendance string?**
   - There is no explicit maximum length mentioned. Assume a reasonably large length within typical string length constraints in JavaScript.

2. **Are there any invalid characters or is input always valid?**
   - You can assume the input is always valid, containing only 'A', 'L', and 'P'.

3. **Is the solution case-sensitive?**
   - No, since the problem specifies the characters are 'A', 'L', and 'P', we assume it's case-sensitive and the input will only be in uppercase.

### Strategy

1. **Count 'A' Characters**: Ensure there is no more than one 'A' in the string.
2. **Check Continuous 'L'**: Ensure that there are no more than two continuous 'L' characters anywhere in the string.

### Code

```javascript
function checkRecord(s) {
    let absents = 0;
    let continuousLate = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === 'A') {
            absents++;
            if (absents > 1) return false;
        }
        
        if (s[i] === 'L') {
            continuousLate++;
            if (continuousLate > 2) return false;
        } else {
            continuousLate = 0;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(checkRecord("PPALLP")); // Output: true
console.log(checkRecord("PPALLL")); // Output: false
console.log(checkRecord("PPAAPL")); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the attendance record string. This is because we scan through the string once, performing constant-time checks and updates.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only need a few extra variables to store counts and do not require any additional space that scales with the input size.
