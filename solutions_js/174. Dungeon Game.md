[Leetcode 174. Dungeon Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l174)
### Problem Statement
The problem 174. Dungeon Game from LeetCode is as follows:

The demons have captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight is initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), and others contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers). Other rooms are empty (represented by 0).

You need to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

- Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health.
- The knight can only move right or down.

```python
def calculateMinimumHP(dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

### Clarifying Questions
Before jumping to the solution, let's consider some clarifying questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are the dimensions of the dungeon grid constrained (e.g., size limits for M and N)?
   - Is the input dungeon guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return the minimal initial health as an integer?

In general competitive programming contexts, you can assume:
- The dungeon grid will be non-empty.
- The grid might have large dimensions, but an algorithm performing optimally in O(M * N) should be feasible.

### Strategy
To determine the minimum initial health required for the knight, we need to work backwards from the princess's position at the bottom-right corner of the grid. The key insight is to use dynamic programming to systematically compute the minimum health needed for each cell starting from the bottom-right and moving towards the top-left.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize DP Table**: Create a DP table of the same size as the dungeon grid.
2. **Start from the Bottom-Right**: Begin calculation from the bottom-right corner where the princess is found, then move left or up cell by cell.
3. **Compute Minimum Health for Each Cell**:
   - For each cell (i, j), the knight's minimum health needed in order to survive past that cell is computed based on the cell's value and the health needed in the cells to its right and below.
   - If the knight needs 5 health points to move right and the current cell subtracts 3 health points, the initial health needed to start must be 8 (since 8 - 3 = 5).

### Code
Hereâ€™s the code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
function calculateMinimumHP(dungeon) {
    const m = dungeon.length;
    const n = dungeon[0].length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity));

    dp[m][n - 1] = dp[m - 1][n] = 1;

    for (let i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            const minHealth = Math.min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]) - dungeon[i][j];
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(minHealth, 1);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][0];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the dungeon grid. This is because we are iterating through each cell exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M * N), due to the additional DP table of the same size as the dungeon grid.

This solution ensures that the knight has the minimum initial health required to survive through the dungeon and rescue the princess from the bottom-right corner.
