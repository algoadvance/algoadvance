[Leetcode 2337. Move Pieces to Obtain a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2337)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of length `n`. Each string consists only of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'` where:
- The characters `'L'` and `'R'` represent pieces that can move to the left or right, respectively.
- The character `'_'` represents an empty space.

You can move a piece in the `start` string under the following rules:
1. A piece 'L' can move to an adjacent empty space on its left.
2. A piece 'R' can move to an adjacent empty space on its right.

You need to determine if it is possible to transform the string `start` into the string `target` using zero or more moves.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can pieces skip over each other?**
   - No, pieces cannot skip over each other; they must move one position at a time to adjacent empty spaces.
2. **What happens if we encounter non-matching characters beyond `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`?**
   - All inputs will only contain 'L', 'R', and '_', so we don't have to handle other characters.

### Code

```javascript
const canTransform = (start, target) => {
    if (start.replace(/_/g, '') !== target.replace(/_/g, '')) {
        return false;
    }

    let startL = [], startR = [];
    let targetL = [], targetR = [];

    //Collecting the positions of 'L' and 'R' in start and target
    for (let i = 0; i < start.length; i++) {
        if (start[i] === 'L') startL.push(i);
        if (start[i] === 'R') startR.push(i);
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] === 'L') targetL.push(i);
        if (target[i] === 'R') targetR.push(i);
    }

    // Check if L positions are valid
    for (let i = 0; i < startL.length; i++) {
        if (startL[i] < targetL[i]) return false;
    }

    // Check if R positions are valid
    for (let i = 0; i < startR.length; i++) {
        if (startR[i] > targetR[i]) return false;
    }

    return true;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Check Character Consistency**: We first check if the `start` and `target` strings, excluding all '_', have the same characters in the same order. If not, it's immediately impossible to transform.
2. **Track Positions**: We track the positions of 'L' and 'R' in both `start` and `target`.
3. **Validation**:
   - For 'L': Every 'L' in `start` should not move to the right of its corresponding position in `target`.
   - For 'R': Every 'R' in `start` should not move to the left of its corresponding position in `target`.

### Time Complexity

- The complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the strings, because all comparisons and iterations over the strings are linear operations.
