[Leetcode 3255. Find the Power of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3255)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers and an integer `k`. A k-size subarray is a contiguous subarray of `nums` where its length is `k`. The power of this k-size subarray is defined as the product of all of the k elements within it. Return an array consisting of the power of each k-size subarray from left to right.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: [2, 6, 12]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty or have fewer elements than k?**
   - No, `n` (the length of `nums`) will always be greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?**
   - The value of `n` can be up to `10^5` and `k` can be up to `n`.

3. **Can there be any zero values in the array?**
   - No, the problem states that the array consists of positive integers only.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach to calculate the power of each k-size subarray. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty result array.
2. Compute the product of the first k elements.
3. Slide the window one element at a time:
   - For each new position, divide the product by the element that is sliding out of the window.
   - Multiply by the element that is entering the window.
4. Append the product to the result array for each step.

This strategy ensures that each element is processed a constant number of times, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Code
Here's how we can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function findPowerOfKSizeSubarrays(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n < k) return []; // In case the input does not meet the constraints.

    const result = [];
    let product = 1;
    
    // Initial product of first k elements
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        product *= nums[i];
    }
    result.push(product);
    
    // Sliding window
    for (let i = k; i < n; i++) {
        product = (product / nums[i - k]) * nums[i];
        result.push(product);
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(findPowerOfKSizeSubarrays([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)); // [2, 6, 12]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is visited a constant number of times to compute the product of the k-size subarrays.

The space complexity is **O(1)** additional space (excluding the space used to store the result), as we are only using a few extra variables to keep track of the current product.
