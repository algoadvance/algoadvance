[Leetcode 2546. Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2546)
### Problem Statement

Given two binary strings `s` and `t`, you need to perform a series of operations to make the strings equal. The operations allowed are:

1. Choose any substring of `s` and flip all bits (`0` to `1` and `1` to `0`). For example, flipping "110" will result in "001".
2. Choose two different positions `i` and `j` in `s` such that `s[i] == s[j]`, and swap the characters at these positions.

You need to determine if it is possible to make the string `s` equal to the string `t`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the two strings have different lengths?
   - No, the strings `s` and `t` are guaranteed to have the same length.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the strings?
   - No explicit constraints are provided in the problem statement, but typical constraints could range from very small to very large lengths up to a practical limit.
3. What should be the return type of the function?
   - The function should return a boolean value: `true` if it is possible to make `s` equal to `t` using the provided operations, and `false` otherwise.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in JavaScript.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function canMakeStringsEqual(s, t) {
    // If s is already equal to t, return true
    if (s === t) return true;

    // Check if both strings have the same characters
    let hasOne = false;
    let hasZero = false;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '1' || t[i] === '1') hasOne = true;
        if (s[i] === '0' || t[i] === '0') hasZero = true;
    }

    // If one of the strings requires a '0' but the other does not contain '0'
    // or requires a '1' but the other does not contain '1', return false
    if (!(hasOne && hasZero)) return false;
    
    return true;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Equality Check**: First, check if `s` is already equal to `t`. If so, return `true`.
2. **Check for One and Zero**: Iterate through both strings to check if both strings collectively contain at least one '1' and one '0'.
   - The rationale is that with the flip and swap operations, we can transform `s` into `t` only if it contains both characters. If one character is completely absent, the transformation is impossible.
3. **Final Decision**: Finally, if both '1' and '0' are present, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the strings, because we iterate through both strings a single time to check for the presence of '1' and '0'. Thus, the solution is efficient and should work well within typical input size constraints.
