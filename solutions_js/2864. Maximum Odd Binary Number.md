[Leetcode 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2864)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1'). You need to rearrange the digits of `s` to form the maximum possible binary number (in decimal form) that is also odd. A binary number is odd if its last digit is '1'. 

Return the maximum odd binary number you can obtain after rearranging the digits of `s`. If no odd binary number can be formed, return an empty string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "010"
Output: "100"
Explanation: One of the ways to get the maximum odd binary number is "100".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: "1110"
Explanation: The maximum odd binary number can be obtained as "1110".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input binary string be empty?**
   - No, the input binary string will always have at least one character.
2. **Does the input binary string always contain at least one '1'?**
   - Based on the problem statement, it seems that the input will contain at least one '1', since an odd binary number must end with '1'. We will handle both cases anyway.
3. **Is there any constraint on the length of the binary string?**
   - The problem statement does not specify constraints on the length, so we will assume the usual constraints of up to a few thousand characters for feasible computation.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Digits:** First, count the number of '0's and '1's in the string.
2. **Form the Largest Odd Binary Number:**
   - If there are no '1's, return an empty string as we cannot form an odd binary number.
   - Otherwise, place all '1's except one at the beginning to form the largest number.
   - Place all '0's in the middle.
   - Place the remaining one '1' at the end to ensure the number is odd.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumOddBinaryNumber(s) {
    let count1 = 0, count0 = 0;

    // Count the number of '0's and '1's
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '1') count1++;
        else count0++;
    }

    // If there are no '1's, return an empty string
    if (count1 === 0) return "";

    // Use all '1's except one at the beginning, then all '0's, finally one '1' at the end
    let result = '1'.repeat(count1 - 1) + '0'.repeat(count0) + '1';

    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(maximumOddBinaryNumber("010")); // Output: "100"
console.log(maximumOddBinaryNumber("1110")); // Output: "1110"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because counting the digits and then constructing the result both take O(n) time individually.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) since we are constructing the result string which will store a number of characters equal to the length of input string `s`.

This approach ensures we rearrange the digits optimally to achieve the maximum possible odd binary number.
