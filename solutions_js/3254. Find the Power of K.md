[Leetcode 3254. Find the Power of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3254)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`. The power of an array is defined as the product of its maximum element and its minimum element. Calculate the sum of the power of all consecutive `k`-size subarrays of `nums`.

Write a function `sumOfPower(nums, k)` that takes in the array `nums` and the integer `k`, and returns the sum of the power of all `k`-size subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array and the value of `k`?
2. Are there any constraints on the values inside the `nums` array (e.g., all positive integers, could include negative numbers)?
3. Should we consider arrays with length less than `k`?

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window**: We'll use a sliding window approach to iterate through all `k`-size subarrays.
2. **Maintain Deques for Min and Max**: To efficiently get the minimum and maximum element in the current window, we can maintain two deques:
    - One deque (`maxDeque`) to keep track of maximums in the current window.
    - Another deque (`minDeque`) to keep track of minimums in the current window.
3. **Initialize Window**: Initialize the first window and populate the deques.
4. **Slide and Calculate**: Slide the window across the array, updating the deques and calculating the power for each window.

### Code

```javascript
function sumOfPower(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length < k) return 0;

    let sumPower = 0;
    let maxDeque = [];
    let minDeque = [];

    // Initialize the first window
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        while (maxDeque.length && nums[maxDeque[maxDeque.length - 1]] <= nums[i]) {
            maxDeque.pop();
        }
        maxDeque.push(i);

        while (minDeque.length && nums[minDeque[minDeque.length - 1]] >= nums[i]) {
            minDeque.pop();
        }
        minDeque.push(i);
    }

    // Function to get the current max and min
    function getMax() {
        return nums[maxDeque[0]];
    }

    function getMin() {
        return nums[minDeque[0]];
    }

    sumPower += getMax() * getMin();

    // Slide the window
    for (let i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Remove elements out of the current window from deques
        if (maxDeque[0] <= i - k) maxDeque.shift();
        if (minDeque[0] <= i - k) minDeque.shift();

        // Push new element to the deques
        while (maxDeque.length && nums[maxDeque[maxDeque.length - 1]] <= nums[i]) {
            maxDeque.pop();
        }
        maxDeque.push(i);

        while (minDeque.length && nums[minDeque[minDeque.length - 1]] >= nums[i]) {
            minDeque.pop();
        }
        minDeque.push(i);

        // Calculate the power for the current window
        sumPower += getMax() * getMin();
    }
    
    return sumPower;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let k = 2;
console.log(sumOfPower(nums, k)); // Output depends on the example, typically should print the sum of powers.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (First Window)**: O(k) to process the first `k` elements.
- **Sliding Window Processing**: For each element from `k` to `nums.length - 1` (total elements `n - k`), each value can be added and removed from deques at most once, leading to O(1) amortized operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is efficient for the problem constraints.
