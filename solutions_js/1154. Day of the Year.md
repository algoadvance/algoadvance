[Leetcode 1154. Day of the Year](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1154)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `date` representing a date in the Gregorian calendar in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, return the day number of the year.

Example:
- Input: `date = "2019-01-09"`
- Output: `9`

Example:
- Input: `date = "2019-02-10"`
- Output: `41`

Note:
- The given `date` is a valid date between the years `1900` and `2019`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input String Format:** Do we need to validate the date format, or can we assume the input is always in `YYYY-MM-DD` format?
   - **Assumption:** The input format is always valid as specified.

2. **Leap Year Handling:** How should we handle leap years?
   - **Clarification:** We need to properly handle leap years, which occur every 4 years, except for years evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

### Strategy
1. **Parsing the Date:** Split the input string to get the year, month, and day.
2. **Leap Year Check:** Implement a helper function to check if a given year is a leap year.
3. **Days Calculation:**
    - Define an array with the number of days for each month considering both regular and leap years.
    - Sum the number of days in preceding months and add the days from the current month to get the day of the year.

### Code

```javascript
function dayOfYear(date) {
    const [year, month, day] = date.split('-').map(Number); 

    const isLeapYear = (year) => {
        if (year % 4 === 0) {
            if (year % 100 === 0) {
                if (year % 400 === 0) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    };
    
    const daysInMonths = [
        31, // January
        28, // February (29 if leap year)
        31, // March
        30, // April
        31, // May
        30, // June
        31, // July
        31, // August
        30, // September
        31, // October
        30, // November
        31  // December
    ];
    
    if (isLeapYear(year)) {
        daysInMonths[1] = 29; // Update February days in a leap year
    }
    
    let dayOfYear = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < month - 1; i++) {
        dayOfYear += daysInMonths[i];
    }
    
    dayOfYear += day;
    
    return dayOfYear;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(dayOfYear("2019-01-09")); // Output: 9
console.log(dayOfYear("2019-02-10")); // Output: 41
console.log(dayOfYear("2000-03-01")); // Output: 61 (Leap year)
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**:
- We perform a constant amount of work regardless of the input. Checking if a year is a leap year and summing the days takes a fixed number of operations.
