[Leetcode 2349. Design a Number Container System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2349)
### Problem Statement

Design a number container system that will be able to perform the following operations:

1. **Insert** or **Replace** a number at a given index.
2. **Return** the smallest index for a given number.

Implement the `NumberContainers` class with these functionalities:

```javascript
class NumberContainers {
    constructor() {
        
    }
    
    change(index, number) {
        
    }
    
    find(number) {
        
    }
}
```

- `change(index: number, number: number): void` - Inserts or replaces a number at the specified index.
- `find(number: number): number` - Returns the smallest index where the specified number is located. If the number is not present, returns -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on inputs**:
   - What are the maximum possible values for `index` and `number`?
   - Should I expect any specific range or type for the index and number (e.g., positive integers)?

2. **Behavior on duplicate numbers**:
   - If a number is assigned to multiple indices, should the `find` method return the smallest index among all those indices?

3. **Handling Deletion**:
   - Should we support a mechanism to remove a number from a specific index?

4. **Thread Safety**:
   - Do we need to manage any concurrency issues in this system, or can we assume a single-threaded environment?

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a `Map` to maintain the mapping of indices to numbers.
   - Use another `Map` of numbers to a `Set` of indices where the given number appears. The `Set` will help keep track of all indices for a particular number and can be utilized to find the smallest index efficiently.

2. **Operations**:
   - **`change(index, number)`**:
     - If the index is already present, update it with the new number and update the mappings accordingly.
     - Update the index map and ensure the number's set of indices is updated.
   - **`find(number)`**:
     - Retrieve the set of indices for the given number, if it exists, and return the smallest index.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the NumberContainers class:

```javascript
class NumberContainers {
    constructor() {
        this.indexToNumber = new Map();
        this.numberToIndices = new Map();
    }
    
    change(index, number) {
        if (this.indexToNumber.has(index)) {
            const oldNumber = this.indexToNumber.get(index);
            if (oldNumber === number) return;
            const oldIndices = this.numberToIndices.get(oldNumber);
            oldIndices.delete(index);
            if (oldIndices.size === 0) {
                this.numberToIndices.delete(oldNumber);
            }
        }
        
        this.indexToNumber.set(index, number);
        if (!this.numberToIndices.has(number)) {
            this.numberToIndices.set(number, new Set());
        }
        this.numberToIndices.get(number).add(index);
    }
    
    find(number) {
        if (!this.numberToIndices.has(number) || this.numberToIndices.get(number).size === 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Return the smallest index in the set
        return Math.min(...this.numberToIndices.get(number));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **change(index, number)**: 
  - Insert operations in both `Map` and `Set` are O(1) on average.
  - Thus, the change operation is O(1) in the average case.
  
- **find(number)**:
  - Fetching the set of indices is O(1).
  - Finding the smallest index involves iterating over the set, giving a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of indices for the given number.
  - Using set iteration, the complexity would be amortized O(1).

This data structure is efficient in terms of both time complexity and memory for the operations described.
