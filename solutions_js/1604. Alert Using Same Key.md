[Leetcode 1604. Alert Using Same Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1604)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1604: **Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period**

An employee uses a key card to access the office building. The building has a security device that records each use of the card. The records are sorted by the key card ID and the time of use. If an employee uses the card three or more times within one hour, you should notify the security team for further investigation.

**Input:**

- A list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a string (employee name) and a string (time in the format "HH:MM").

**Output:**

- A list of employee names who used the key card three or more times within any one-hour period, sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the records always sorted by the employee name and then by time?
   - Can the same time be recorded multiple times for the same employee?

2. **Time Format:**
   - Can we assume that the time strings will always be valid and in the "HH:MM" format?

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Input:** Create a dictionary where the keys are employee names and the values are lists of times (parsed into minutes for easier comparison).

2. **Sliding Window:** For each employee, check the list of times using a sliding window to see if there are three or more usages within a 60-minute window.

3. **Collect Results:** Create a list of employee names who meet the alert condition and sort this list before returning it.

### Code

```javascript
function alertNames(keyName, keyTime) {
    const nameToTimes = {};

    // Step 1: Organize times by employee name
    for (let i = 0; i < keyName.length; i++) {
        const name = keyName[i];
        const time = keyTime[i];
        if (!nameToTimes[name]) {
            nameToTimes[name] = [];
        }
        nameToTimes[name].push(time);
    }

    const alertList = [];

    const parseTime = (timeStr) => {
        const [hours, minutes] = timeStr.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    // Step 2: Check each employee's times
    for (const name in nameToTimes) {
        const times = nameToTimes[name].map(parseTime).sort((a, b) => a - b);

        for (let i = 0; i <= times.length - 3; i++) {
            if (times[i + 2] - times[i] <= 60) {
                alertList.push(name);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return alertList.sort();
}

// Sample Input
const keyName = ["daniel", "daniel", "daniel", "luis", "luis", "luis", "luis"];
const keyTime = ["10:00", "10:40", "11:00", "09:00", "09:30", "10:00", "11:00"];

// Sample Output
console.log(alertNames(keyName, keyTime)); // Output: ["daniel", "luis"]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Parsing Time Complexity:**
    - O(n) for iterating through the `keyName` and `keyTime` arrays, where `n` is the number of records.
    - O(m log m) for sorting the parsed times for each employee, where `m` is the number of time entries for a particular employee.
    - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity for the sorting would be O(n log n) if there is a large number of records for a single employee.

2. **Sliding Window:** 
   - O(m) for each employee to determine if there are three or more entries within a 60-minute window.

Overall, the dominant part is sorting the times, so the time complexity is O(n log n).
