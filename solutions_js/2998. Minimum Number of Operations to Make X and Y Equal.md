[Leetcode 2998. Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2998)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `X` and `Y`. In one operation, you can:

- Add 1 to the smaller number (`min(X, Y)`)
- Subtract 1 from the larger number (`max(X, Y)`)

Determine the minimum number of operations required to make `X` and `Y` equal.

### Example
1. Input: `X = 5`, `Y = 9`
   Output: `2`

2. Input: `X = 7`, `Y = 10`
   Output: `1`

### Constraints
- `0 <= X, Y <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `X` and `Y` be negative?  
   **A**: No, `X` and `Y` are guaranteed to be non-negative per the constraints.

2. **Q**: Can `X` or `Y` be zero?  
   **A**: Yes, they can be zero.

3. **Q**: What if `X` is already equal to `Y`?  
   **A**: If `X` is already equal to `Y`, the number of operations required is `0`.

## Strategy

The strategy here is to realize that in each valid operation, we either increment the smaller value by 1 or decrement the larger value by 1. To make X and Y equal, we need to effectively eliminate the difference between them. 

The minimum number of operations required will be half of the difference between `X` and `Y`, because each operation reduces the difference by 2 (one increment and one decrement).

## Code

```javascript
function minOperationsToMakeEqual(X, Y) {
    return Math.abs(X - Y) / 2;
}

// Example Tests
console.log(minOperationsToMakeEqual(5, 9)); // Expected Output: 2
console.log(minOperationsToMakeEqual(7, 10)); // Expected Output: 1
console.log(minOperationsToMakeEqual(6, 6)); // Expected Output: 0
console.log(minOperationsToMakeEqual(0, 10)); // Expected Output: 5
console.log(minOperationsToMakeEqual(20, 25)); // Expected Output: 2.5
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the code above is clearly `O(1)` because the calculation `Math.abs(X - Y) / 2` is done in constant time regardless of the input values of `X` and `Y`. This performance holds true within the problem's constraints.
