[Leetcode 1422. Maximum Score After Splitting a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1422)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of only '0's and '1's, we can split `s` into two non-empty substrings `left` and `right`. The score after splitting the string is defined as the number of '0's in `left` + the number of '1's in `right`. Return the maximum score possible after splitting the string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the length range of string `s`? (Typical constraint in problems similar to this one)
   
2. **Characters in the String:**
   - Can `s` contain characters other than '0' and '1'?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What is the minimum length of `s` we need to consider for a valid input?
   - Should we consider the scenarios where all characters in the string are the same, i.e., all '0's or all '1's?

## Code

Here is a JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxScore = function(s) {
    let maxScore = 0;
    let onesOnRight = s.split('1').length - 1;
    let zerosOnLeft = 0;

    // Iterate through the string and calculate the score for each split.
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            zerosOnLeft++;
        } else {
            onesOnRight--;
        }

        // Current score is zerosOnLeft + onesOnRight.
        let currentScore = zerosOnLeft + onesOnRight;
        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currentScore);
    }

    return maxScore;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxScore("011101")); // Output: 5
console.log(maxScore("00111"));  // Output: 5
console.log(maxScore("1111"));    // Output: 3
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Count all the '1's in the string to get the initial `onesOnRight`.
   - Initialize `zerosOnLeft` to 0 and `maxScore` to 0.

2. **Iterate through each possible split point:**
   - Iterate over each character in the string from start to the second last character (because we need non-empty substrings).
   - If the character is '0', increment `zerosOnLeft`.
   - If the character is '1', decrement `onesOnRight`.
   - Calculate the `currentScore` as the sum of `zerosOnLeft` and `onesOnRight`.
   - Update `maxScore` if `currentScore` is greater than `maxScore`.

3. **Return:**
   - Return the `maxScore` obtained after considering all possible splits.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because the implementation involves a single pass through the string to count '1's and another pass to calculate the score for each split, yielding linear complexity.
