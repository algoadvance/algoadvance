[Leetcode 1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1662)
## Problem Statement

Given two string arrays `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if the two arrays represent the same string, and `false` otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order form the string.

### Example 1:

- **Input:** word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** word1 represents string "abc" and word2 also represents string "abc".

### Example 2:

- **Input:** word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
- **Output:** false

### Example 3:

- **Input:** word1 = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
- **Output:** true

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - No, you can assume that `word1` and `word2` contain at least one string.

2. **What is the length range of strings in arrays?**
   - The length of each string could range from `1` to `100`.

3. **Could the solution consider case-sensitive comparisons?**
   - Yes, the comparison will be case-sensitive.

## Strategy

1. **Concatenate Strings:** Convert both arrays of strings into single strings by concatenating their elements.
2. **Compare Strings:** Return the result of comparing these concatenated strings.

## Code

```javascript
function arrayStringsAreEqual(word1, word2) {
    // Convert both word arrays to single strings by joining their elements
    const str1 = word1.join('');
    const str2 = word2.join('');

    // Compare the resulting strings
    return str1 === str2;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(arrayStringsAreEqual(["ab", "c"], ["a", "bc"])); // true
console.log(arrayStringsAreEqual(["a", "cb"], ["ab", "c"])); // false
console.log(arrayStringsAreEqual(["abc", "d", "defg"], ["abcddefg"])); // true
```

## Time Complexity

- **Concatenation:** Joining strings in each array is an O(n) operation, where n is the total number of characters.
- **Comparison:** Comparing two strings is also O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the total number of characters across both `word1` and `word2`.

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and ensures that we compare the concatenated results directly with minimum overhead.
