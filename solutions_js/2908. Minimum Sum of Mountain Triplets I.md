[Leetcode 2908. Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2908)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` representing the heights of various mountains arranged in a line. You need to find the minimum sum of any triplet (i, j, k) such that:

1. 0 <= i < j < k < nums.length
2. nums[i] < nums[j] > nums[k]

In other words, `nums[j]` should be the peak, while `nums[i]` and `nums[k]` should be the left and right valleys, respectively.

Return the minimum sum of such a triplet. If no such triplet exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input array length?**
    - This will help determine the feasibility of different strategies based on time complexity.

2. **Are all integers in the input array distinct?**
    - This can simplify the problem if they are distinct.

3. **Can we have negative integers in the input array?**
    - This will affect the calculation of the sum.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. Traverse the array to determine possible peaks.
2. For each peak, find the smallest possible left valley and right valley to minimize the triplet sum.
3. Keep track of the minimum sum encountered.

Here is a possible approach:
- Use two auxiliary arrays, `leftMin` and `rightMin`, where:
  - `leftMin[j]` stores the minimum value to the left of `j` (i.e., for all `i < j`).
  - `rightMin[j]` stores the minimum value to the right of `j` (i.e., for all `k > j`).
- For each possible peak `j`, calculate the sum using the values from `leftMin` and `rightMin`.

### Time Complexity

The solution needs to traverse the array a few times, so the time complexity will likely be O(n), where n is the length of the array. Maintaining the auxiliary arrays will also be O(n).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumSumOfMountainTriplets = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n < 3) return -1;

    // Initialize auxiliary arrays
    const leftMin = new Array(n).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
    const rightMin = new Array(n).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);

    // Fill leftMin
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        leftMin[i] = Math.min(leftMin[i - 1], nums[i - 1]);
    }

    // Fill rightMin
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        rightMin[i] = Math.min(rightMin[i + 1], nums[i + 1]);
    }

    let minSum = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    for (let j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
        if (nums[j] > leftMin[j] && nums[j] > rightMin[j]) {
            const currentSum = leftMin[j] + nums[j] + rightMin[j];
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
        }
    }

    return minSum === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? -1 : minSum;
};

// Example usage:
// nums = [2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 5]
// console.log(minimumSumOfMountainTriplets(nums)); // Output should be relevant to the triplet meeting the condition
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We create two arrays (`leftMin` and `rightMin`) to keep track of the minimum values to the left and right of each index, initialized to the largest possible integer initially.
2. **Left Min Array**: Traverse from left to right to fill the `leftMin` array where each position `j` contains the minimum value to the left of `j`.
3. **Right Min Array**: Traverse from right to left to fill the `rightMin` array where each position `j` contains the minimum value to the right of `j`.
4. **Checking Peaks**: Iterate over each possible peak position `j` (from `1` to `n-2`) and check if `nums[j]` is greater than both `leftMin[j]` and `rightMin[j]`. If valid, compute the sum and update the minimum sum.
5. **Return Result**: If a valid triplet was found, return the minimum sum; otherwise, return `-1`.

This approach ensures that we're efficiently finding the minimum sum of any valid mountain triplet while adhering to O(n) time complexity.
