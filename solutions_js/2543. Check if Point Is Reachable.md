[Leetcode 2543. Check if Point Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2543)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `x` and `y`, representing the coordinates of a point on a 2D plane, determine if you can reach the point `(x, y)` starting from `(0, 0)` by repeatedly performing the following steps any number of times:

1. Move from `(a, b)` to `(a + b, b)`
2. Move from `(a, b)` to `(a, a + b)`

Write a function `isReachable(x, y)` that takes two integers `x` and `y`, and returns a boolean indicating if the point `(x, y)` is reachable from `(0, 0)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validation**: Are `x` and `y` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - Assume `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.

2. **Output**: Should the output be a simple `true` or `false`?
   - Yes.

3. **Transformation Operations**: Can you only use the transformations provided, or can other methods be used?
   - Only the provided transformations can be used.

### Strategy

To determine if a point `(x, y)` is reachable, consider the reverse direction to understand if you can reduce `(x, y)` to `(0, 0)` using inverse operations:
1. From `(a, b)` to `(a + b, b)`, if working backward, you would go from `(a + b, b)` to `(a, b)` if `a + b > b`.
2. From `(a, b)` to `(a, a + b)`, if working backward, you would go from `(a, a + b)` to `(a, b)` if `a + b > a`.

An observation:
- The operations `(a + b, b)` and `(a, a + b)` resemble the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). Therefore, if the GCD of `x` and `y` is not 1, you might have a common factor that can help determine the reachability.

The idea is to keep reducing `x` and `y` by their GCD operations until you either reduce one of the coordinates to zero (impossible position if the other is non-zero), or you reach `(0, 0)`.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on the strategy:
```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        [a, b] = [b, a % b];
    }
    return a;
}

function isReachable(x, y) {
    // As long as both x and y are not zero, keep reducing them
    while (x !== 0 && y !== 0) {
        if (x > y) {
            x %= y;
        } else {
            y %= x;
        }
    }
    // We can reach (0, 0) only if one of the numbers is 1 at some stage
    return x === 1 || y === 1;
}

console.log(isReachable(5, 3)); // true
console.log(isReachable(2, 3)); // true
console.log(isReachable(8, 16)); // false
console.log(isReachable(10, 1)); // true
```

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation**: Each iteration in the while loop reduces the value of `x` or `y` by a significant fraction using Euclid's algorithm, which runs in `O(log(min(x, y)))` time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of the `isReachable` function is `O(log(min(x, y)))`.
