[Leetcode 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l516)
### Problem Statement
516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence:
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   
   *Typically, constraints like the maximum length of the string can help in deciding the optimal approach.*
   
   - **Answer:** Length of the string \( s \leq 1000 \).

2. **Characters in String**:
   - Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
   
   *Understanding the character set can help optimize certain operations.*
   
   - **Answer:** Yes, the string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - Should the function return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence, or the subsequence itself?
   
   - **Answer:** The function should return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i...j]`.
   - Initialize the DP array such that every single character is a palindrome of length 1 (`dp[i][i] = 1`).
   - Use a bottom-up approach to fill the DP table.
   - If `s[i]` == `s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`.
   - If `s[i]` != `s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
   - The result will be in `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty string: The longest palindromic subsequence is `0`.
   - String with one character: The longest palindromic subsequence is `1`.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
    }

    // Fill the dp array
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            if (s[i] === s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Filling the table requires iterating over all substrings, which takes \(O(n^2)\), and for each substring, we perform a constant amount of work.
- Thus, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) due to the DP table used to store the results of subproblems.
