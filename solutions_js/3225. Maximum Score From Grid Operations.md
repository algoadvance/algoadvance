[Leetcode 3225. Maximum Score From Grid Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3225)
## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers, you can perform the following operation on the matrix any number of times:
- Pick any element in the matrix, and increase it by 1.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of elements in the matrix that are divisible by 3. Return the maximum sum of elements that are divisible by 3 after performing the above operation any number of times.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[2,6,7],[1,0,4]]
Output: 27
Explanation: We can increment some elements so that the sum of elements divisible by 3 is 27. For example, increment the element at (0,2) by 2 to make it 9 (which is divisible by 3), and increment elements (1,0) and (1,2) by 1 to make them 3 and 6 (both divisible by 3). The final grid looks like [[2,6,9],[3,0,6]], and the sum of elements divisible by 3 is 27.
```

### Constraints:
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we modify the original grid, or do we need to preserve its initial state?
2. Are there any constraints on the maximum number of operations?
3. Are elements allowed to exceed 100 after being incremented?

## Strategy
1. **Identify Divisibility by 3:** For each element in the grid, determine how many increments are necessary to make it divisible by 3.
2. **Modification:** Increment each element the appropriate number of times to ensure it becomes divisible by 3.
3. **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum of all elements that are divisible by 3 after modifications.

## Code
```javascript
function maxSumDivisibleBy3(grid) {
    function toDivisibleBy3(num) {
        return num + (3 - (num % 3)) % 3;
    }

    let totalSum = 0;

    for (let row of grid) {
        for (let elem of row) {
            totalSum += toDivisibleBy3(elem);
        }
    }

    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage:
let grid = [[2, 6, 7],[1, 0, 4]];
console.log(maxSumDivisibleBy3(grid)); // Output: 27
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. We iterate through each element once to determine the necessary increments and add them.

This function ensures that we achieve the maximum possible sum of elements that are divisible by 3 in the grid.
