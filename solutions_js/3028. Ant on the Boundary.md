[Leetcode 3028. Ant on the Boundary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3028)
### Problem Statement

You are given a matrix, `grid`, of size `m x n` and an `ant`. The ant starts at the cell `(i, j)`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of moves required for the ant to move out of the grid boundary. The ant can only move up, down, left, or right.

Return the minimum number of moves required for the ant to move out of the grid boundaries, or -1 if it is not possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundaries for index positions**: Can the `i`, `j` be invalid initially (i.e., start outside the grid) or should they always be a valid starting position?
   - The starting position `(i, j)` will always be valid, i.e., within the grid boundaries.

2. **Grid Contents**: Does the grid contain any obstacles or special values that alter movements?
   - No, the grid does not contain any obstacles or special conditions; the cells are just placeholders.

3. **Grid Size Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the grid `m` and `n`?
   - Assume reasonable constraints where `m` and `n` are in the range of `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we will use a Breadth-first Search (BFS) algorithm because it is optimal for finding the shortest path in unweighted grids. We will perform the following steps:
1. Queue will store the positions (i, j) of the ant and the number of steps taken.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited positions to prevent re-visiting them.
3. For each cell, check all four possible directions the ant can move (up, down, left, right).
4. If a next position is out of the grid, return the number of steps it took to reach that position.
5. If the ant exhausts all possibilities without moving out of the grid, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumMovesToBoundary(grid, startRow, startCol) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [
        [-1, 0], // up
        [1, 0],  // down
        [0, -1], // left
        [0, 1]   // right
    ];

    // Initialize BFS queue and visited set
    const queue = [{ row: startRow, col: startCol, steps: 0 }];
    const visited = new Set([`${startRow},${startCol}`]);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const { row, col, steps } = queue.shift();

        // Check if the current position is at the boundary
        if (row === 0 || row === m - 1 || col === 0 || col === n - 1) {
            return steps;
        }

        for (const [dRow, dCol] of directions) {
            const newRow = row + dRow;
            const newCol = col + dCol;
            const posString = `${newRow},${newCol}`;

            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && !visited.has(posString)) {
                queue.push({ row: newRow, col: newCol, steps: steps + 1 });
                visited.add(posString);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The problem is modeled with a BFS, hence:
- **Time complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` and `n` represent the number of rows and columns of the grid. In the worst case, you may need to visit each cell once.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for the queue and the visited set.

This implementation ensures we find the minimum number of moves required for the ant to exit the grid or determine if it's not possible.
