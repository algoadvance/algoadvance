[Leetcode 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1389)
## Problem Statement
You are given two arrays of integers `nums` and `index`. Your task is to create a target array under the following rules:
- Initially, the target array is empty.
- For each element `nums[i]` at index `i`:
  - Insert the value `nums[i]` at index `index[i]` in the target array.

Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `nums` and `index` always of the same length?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that both arrays are of the same length.
2. **Can we assume the values in `index` will always be valid for insertion operations?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees valid insertion operations.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will:
1. Initialize an empty array called `target`.
2. Iterate over the array indices.
3. For each index `i`, insert `nums[i]` at position `index[i]` in the `target` array using the `splice` method.
   - `splice` allows inserting elements at specified positions, which is ideal for this problem.

## Code

```javascript
function createTargetArray(nums, index) {
    let target = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        target.splice(index[i], 0, nums[i]);
    }
    
    return target;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(createTargetArray([0,1,2,3,4], [0,1,2,2,1])); // Output: [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]
```

## Time Complexity
- The primary operations performed here are inserting elements using `splice`.
- In the worst case, where elements are predominantly inserted at the beginning of the array, each insertion can take up to O(n) time due to array elements needing to be shifted.
- As there are `n` elements to be inserted, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

Thus, the time complexity of this approach is **O(n^2)**.

Feel free to ask any further clarifications or provide more examples if needed!
