[Leetcode 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1663)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to construct the lexicographically smallest string with a given length `n` and numeric value `k`.

A string's numeric value is determined by the sum of its character values. Each character in the string is between 'a' (value 1) and 'z' (value 26).

**Constraints:**
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- \(n \leq k \leq 26n\)

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the string always be exactly `n` characters long?
2. Is there a specific format for the output, or should it just be the constructed string?

Given these clarifications:
- Yes, the string length should be exactly `n`.
- The output should be the smallest lexicographical string that meets the conditions.

### Strategy

To construct the lexicographically smallest string:
1. Start with a string of `n` 'a's, resulting in an initial value of `n * 1` (since 'a' has a value of 1).
2. Calculate the remaining value we need to add to reach `k`, which is `k - n`.
3. Starting from the end of the string, increment each character as much as possible (up to 'z') to minimize the number of increments required while maintaining the lexicographically smallest order.

The steps are as follows:
- Initialize a string of 'a's with length `n`.
- Iterate from the end to the start of this string and try to maximize the character value while minimizing the increments needed.

### Code

```javascript
function getSmallestString(n, k) {
    // Initialize the result array with 'a' which is equivalent of 1 in value.
    let result = Array(n).fill('a');
    
    // Remaining value that needs to be distributed.
    let remainingValue = k - n;
    
    // Traverse from the end of the result array.
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        // Maximum value that can be added to the current position is 25 ('z' - 'a').
        let increment = Math.min(25, remainingValue);
        
        // Update the character at the current position.
        result[i] = String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt(0) + increment);
        
        // Decrease the remaining value by the value added to the current character.
        remainingValue -= increment;
        
        if (remainingValue <= 0) break;  // No need to continue if there's no remaining value to distribute.
    }

    // Join the array to form the resultant string.
    return result.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(getSmallestString(5, 73));  // Output: "aaszz"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because the algorithm involves initializing the array and potentially iterating over it once from the end to the start. Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and effective.
