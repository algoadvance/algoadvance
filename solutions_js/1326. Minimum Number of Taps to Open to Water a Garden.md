[Leetcode 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1326)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` representing the length of a garden in units. There are `n+1` taps located at `points[0, 1, ..., n]` in the garden. You are given an integer array `ranges` of length `n+1` where `ranges[i]` represents the range of the `i-th` tap. That is, a tap at position `i` can water the interval from `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]`. 

Return the minimum number of taps that need to be open to water the whole garden, i.e., the interval `[0, n]`. If the garden cannot be watered by opening the given taps, return `-1`.

### Example
```
Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at position 0 can cover the interval [-3, 3] which means it covers the entire garden [0, 5].

Input: n = 7, ranges = [1,2,1,0,2,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The garden can be watered by opening taps at positions 1, 4, and 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the interval `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` for a tap be bounded within `[0, n]`?
   - Yes, any interval extending beyond `0` or `n` should be clipped to `[0, n]`.
2. Can the ranges be zero meaning a tap does not water any area?
   - Yes, ranges can be zero, which means those taps do not contribute to watering the garden.

### Strategy
A good approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm:
1. Convert the `ranges` array into an interval array where each interval `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` represents the watered area.
2. Sort those intervals by their starting points.
3. Use a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of intervals that can cover the entire garden from `[0, n]`. 
4. Iterate through the intervals, and at each step, extend the furthest end of coverage until the entire range `[0, n]` is covered.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function minTaps(n, ranges) {
    // Convert the ranges to intervals `[start, end]`
    const intervals = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        intervals.push([Math.max(0, i - ranges[i]), Math.min(n, i + ranges[i])]);
    }
    
    // Sort intervals by their starting points
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    let taps = 0;
    let end = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (end < n) {
        let farthest = end;
        
        // Iterate through all intervals that start before or at the current end
        while (i < intervals.length && intervals[i][0] <= end) {
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, intervals[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // If we cannot extend the coverage further, return -1
        if (farthest <= end) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Extend the coverage to the farthest reachable point
        taps++;
        end = farthest;
    }
    
    return taps;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minTaps(5, [3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0])); // Output: 1
console.log(minTaps(7, [1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1])); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** Sorting the intervals takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Greedy Selection:** Iterating through the intervals takes `O(n)`.

So the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
