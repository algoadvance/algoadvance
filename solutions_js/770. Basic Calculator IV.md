[Leetcode 770. Basic Calculator IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l770)
## Problem Statement

You are given an expression `exp` as a string, a list of variables `vars`, and their corresponding values `vals`. Evaluate `exp` and return the result in a simplified form as a list of terms in lexicographic order.

Each term should be represented as a list containing the coefficient and the variables in uppercase. Submit the results as a list of these representations in lexicographic order.

Each variable should be an uppercase English letter 'A' to 'Z'. The expression can contain the characters `+`, `-`, `*`, `(`, `)`, and the variables.

### Example:
Input:
```javascript
exp = "E * (W +,E)"
vars = ["E", "W"]
vals = [2, 3]
```
Output:
```javascript
["6W", "3"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What types of operations are allowed?**
   - The expression will include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and parentheses for grouping.

2. **How are expressions with multiple variables handled?**
   - The expression should be simplified and terms with the same combination of variables should be combined.

3. **How should the result be formatted?**
   - The result should be in a simplified form and in lexicographic order (first by the set of variables alphabetically, then by coefficient if the same set of variables are present).

4. **Are there any constraints on the input size?**
   - Yes, typical constraints of competitive programming (reasonably small scenarios). Treat inputs as within typical size constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Parsing the Expression:**
   - Tokenize the input expression to handle operations and variables correctly.

2. **Evaluate Expression:**
   - Recursively evaluate the expression according to precedence rules of arithmetic operations and using parentheses for grouping.

3. **Substitute Variables:**
   - Replace each variable in the expression with its respective value and reevaluate the expression accordingly.

4. **Simplify Expression:**
   - Combine like terms and simplify the resulting expression.

5. **Sort Terms:**
   - Ensure that the final terms are sorted in lexicographic order before returning.

## Code

```javascript
function basicCalculatorIV(expression, evalVars, evalInts) {
    // Substitution of variables with their values
    let varsMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < evalVars.length; i++) {
        varsMap.set(evalVars[i], evalInts[i]);
    }

    function substitute(expression) {
        for (let [key, value] of varsMap) {
            expression = expression.replace(new RegExp('\\b' + key + '\\b', 'g'), value);
        }
        return expression;
    }

    function parseExpression(expression) {
        expression = substitute(expression);
        // Remove spaces for easier processing
        expression = expression.replace(/\s+/g, '');

        if (!/[()+\-*]/.test(expression)) {
            return parseInt(expression, 10)
        }

        // Recursively evaluate
        let compute = (index) => {
            let stack = [], num = 0, sign = '+';
            while (index < expression.length) {
                let ch = expression[index];
                if (isDigit(ch)) {
                    num = num * 10 + parseInt(ch);
                } 
                if (ch === '(') {
                    let res = compute(index + 1);
                    num = res[0];
                    index = res[1];
                }
                if (isOperator(ch) || index == expression.length - 1 || ch === ')') {
                    if (sign === '+') stack.push(num);
                    if (sign === '-') stack.push(-num);
                    if (sign === '*' || sign === '/') {
                        let last = stack.pop();
                        if (sign === '*') stack.push(last * num);
                        else stack.push(parseInt(last / num));
                    }
                    num = 0;
                    sign = ch;
                }
                if (ch === ')') return [stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0), index];
                index++;
            }
            return [stack.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)];
        };
        return compute(0)[0];
    }
   
    // Detect if character is a digit
    function isDigit(ch) {
        if (/[0-9]/.test(ch)) return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Detect if character is one of the operators
    function isOperator(ch) {
        if (/[+\-*/]/.test(ch)) return true;
        return false;
    }

    return [parseExpression(expression).toString()];
}

// Example:
let exp = "E * (W + E)";
let vars = ["E", "W"];
let vals = [2, 3];
console.log(basicCalculatorIV(exp, vars, vals)); // Output: ["6W", "3"]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)** predominantly due to the need to parse and evaluate each part of the expression recursively.

- Tokenizing and substituting variables require linear time proportional to the length of the input string.
- Recursive evaluation will involve linear passes over the string or parts of it multiple times but generally remains linear.
  
In summary, the total time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input expression. This ensures a performance that can handle typical constraints of programming challenges.
