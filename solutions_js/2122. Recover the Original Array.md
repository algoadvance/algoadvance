[Leetcode 2122. Recover the Original Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2122)
## Problem Statement

A programmatic problem is presented where we are given an array of integers produced by interleaving the elements of an original array and its duplicates, with some modification. Your task is to recover the original array and print it.

Here is what the problem looks like in detail:
Given an array `changed`, you need to find the original array `original` such that:
- `original` is an integer array of length `n`.
- `changed` is an array of integers of length `2n`.
- `changed` is formed by taking each element from `original`, duplicating it, and then shuffling the duplicated array.

**Constraints:**
1. The elements in `original` are non-negative integers.
2. The length of `changed` is integer `2n`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What if there are duplicates in the original array?
   - The interleaving can handle duplicates, and each duplicated value in `original` will appear exactly twice in `changed`.
   
2. What if `changed` cannot be formed by interleaving an array and its duplicate?
   - In such a case, the answer should be an empty array.

3. What should we return or print?
   - Return the original array if possible, else return an empty array.

## Strategy

The strategy is as follows:
1. Firstly, check if the length of `changed` can be divided by 2, otherwise, return an empty array.
2. Use a frequency counter to count occurrences of each element in `changed`.
3. Iterate through the sorted keys of this frequency counter.
4. For each key, check if there are sufficient pairs of the number to fulfill `changed`. Remove/counterbalance the pairs accordingly.
5. Collect the corresponding elements for the output `original` array.
6. If at any point it is not possible to form pairs from the count, return an empty array.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step code to recover the original array:

## Code

```javascript
function findOriginalArray(changed) {
    if (changed.length % 2 !== 0) return [];
    
    const freqCounter = new Map();
    for (let num of changed) {
        freqCounter.set(num, (freqCounter.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const sortedKeys = [...freqCounter.keys()].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let original = [];

    for (let key of sortedKeys) {
        if (freqCounter.get(key) > (freqCounter.get(key * 2) || 0)) {
            return [];
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < freqCounter.get(key); i++) {
            original.push(key);
            freqCounter.set(key * 2, freqCounter.get(key * 2) - 1);
            if (freqCounter.get(key * 2) === 0) {
                freqCounter.delete(key * 2);
            }
        }
    }

    return original;
}
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **Check Length**: If the length of the `changed` array is odd, it can't be split into pairs, so we return an empty array.
2. **Frequency Counter**: Utilize a `Map` to count occurrences of each number in `changed`.
3. **Sorting**: Sorting the unique numbers helps to ensure we handle smaller numbers first (important when dealing with potential doubled values).
4. **Building `original`**: Iterate through the sorted keys, ensure there are enough doubled values to match each original number. Increment if valid, otherwise return an empty array.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the `changed` array.
- **Frequency Count and Iteration**: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
