[Leetcode 1078. Occurrences After Bigram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1078)
### Problem Statement

Given words `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third", where `second` comes immediately after `first`, and `third` comes immediately after `second`.

For each such occurrence, you want to collect the word `third`, i.e., the word immediately following the occurrence of the pair `first second`.

Return an array of all the words `third` collected in the order they appear.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Is the input a string and two words?
   - Yes, the input consists of a string `text` and two words `first` and `second`.

2. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the input lengths and characters?
   - The length of `text` is at most 1000 words, and all words in `text` consist of lower-case English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take the following approach:

1. Split the input `text` into an array of words.
2. Iterate through this array and look for occurrences where a word matches `first` and the next word matches `second`.
3. When we find such a pair, we collect the word immediately following `second` (if it exists) into a result array.
4. Return the result array.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve this problem:

```javascript
function findOcurrences(text, first, second) {
    const words = text.split(' ');
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 2; i++) {
        if (words[i] === first && words[i + 1] === second) {
            result.push(words[i + 2]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findOcurrences("alice is a good girl she is a good student", "a", "good")); // ["girl", "student"]
console.log(findOcurrences("we will we will rock you", "we", "will")); // ["we", "rock"]
console.log(findOcurrences("I love love toast", "love", "love")); // ["toast"]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The primary operation is iterating through the words in the text, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of words in the `text`.
  - Splitting the text into words is also O(n), so the overall time complexity remains O(n).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space used to store the words after splitting is O(n).
  - Additional space is used to store the result array, which could be at most O(n-2) in the worst case (if every third word after each pair matches).
  - Hence, the space complexity is O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find and store the third words following each specified bigram occurrence.
