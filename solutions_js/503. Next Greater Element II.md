[Leetcode 503. Next Greater Element II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l503)
### Problem Statement

You are given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

2. **What is the maximum length of the input array?**
   - Typically, constraints will be given in the problem statement, but for practical interview purposes, you can assume it fits within typical memory limits for a coding interview.

3. **Should the solution account for large performance trade-offs?**
   - Yes, the solution should ideally be efficient with respect to both time and space complexity.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a stack to keep track of indices of elements for which we are trying to find the next greater element. We will iterate through the array twice (this accounts for the circular nature of the array), and during the second iteration, any unresolved elements in the stack should be resolved.

1. Create an array `result` initialized to `-1` to store the next greater elements.
2. Use a stack to keep track of indices where the next greater element hasn't been found yet.
3. Iterate through the array twice using mod operation to simulate circular array behavior.
4. For each element, check if it resolves any indices in the stack by comparing it with the element at those indices.
5. Update the `result` for resolved indices and maintain the stack for unresolved indices.

### Code
```javascript
function nextGreaterElements(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let result = Array(n).fill(-1);
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        let num = nums[i % n];
        
        while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] < num) {
            let index = stack.pop();
            result[index] = num;
        }
        
        if (i < n) {
            stack.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(nextGreaterElements([1, 2, 1])); // Output: [2, -1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. We effectively iterate through the array twice, making the time complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack and the result array used for storing indices and next greater elements, respectively.
