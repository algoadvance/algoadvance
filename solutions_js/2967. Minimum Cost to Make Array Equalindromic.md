[Leetcode 2967. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equalindromic](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2967)
### Problem Statement
You are given two arrays `nums` and `cost` each of length `n`. You can apply the following operation any number of times:
1. Select an index `i` such that `1 <= i <= n-1`.
2. Set `nums[i] = nums[i-1]`.

The cost of each operation is `cost[i-1]`.

Your goal is to make `nums` a non-decreasing array while minimizing the total cost.

Return the minimum total cost to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
2. Can `cost` contain zero or negative numbers?
3. Will the array `nums` be empty or can it have a single element?
4. Are we guaranteed that the input sizes for `nums` and `cost` will always be the same?

### Strategy
The goal is to make `nums` non-decreasing. The operation allows us to copy the value of the previous element in the array at a certain cost. The optimal strategy would be to first identify positions where `nums[i] < nums[i-1]` and then decide whether to perform operations to make them equal.

However, since we're aiming for minimal cost to make the array non-decreasing, a common dynamic programming approach might work. Here, we need to figure out the smallest cost to make each element in `nums` equal to or greater than the previous elements.

### Code Implementation

Here's the step-by-step implementation of the solution:

```javascript
/*
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCostToMakeArrayNonDecreasing = function(nums, cost) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] <= nums[i]) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j]);
            } else {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + (nums[j] - nums[i]) * cost[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    return Math.min(...dp);
};
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Create a `dp` array to store the minimum cost to make the array non-decreasing up to each index. Initialize the first element of `dp` to 0 because there's no cost associated with the first element itself.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: Iterate through each element `i` in `nums` starting from the second element. For each element, look at all previous elements `j` and calculate whether it's cheaper to match element `i` with `j` using the given cost.

3. **Minimize Cost**: For each `nums[i]`, compute the cost to make all previous elements up to `i` equal or less than `nums[i]`. Store the minimum cost in `dp[i]`.

4. **Result**: The minimum value in the `dp` array will give the minimum cost to make the entire array non-decreasing.

### Time Complexity
- **Optimal Solution**: The provided solution works but is not the most efficient due to nested loops, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The inherent goal is to reduce this complexity to a more optimal approach.

Further optimization is possible by utilizing more advanced techniques such as binary search or segment trees to keep track of and update the dynamic programming costs more efficiently.
