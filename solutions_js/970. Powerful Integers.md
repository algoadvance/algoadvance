[Leetcode 970. Powerful Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l970)
## Problem Statement

The problem "970. Powerful Integers" from LeetCode is defined as follows:

Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, you need to return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

A powerful integer is defined as an integer that can be expressed as:

```
x^i + y^j
```

where `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer needs to be sparsely populated and contains no duplicates.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= x, y <= 100`
- `0 <= bound <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `x` and `y` be equal?
2. How should we handle cases where `x` or `y` is `1`?
3. Are there any specific constraints on the performance of the solution?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Iterate over possible values for `i` and `j` until `x^i` and `y^j` exceed `bound` respectively.
2. For each pair `(i, j)`, compute the number `x^i + y^j`.
3. Check if the computed number is less than or equal to `bound`.
4. Collect all valid numbers into a set to avoid duplicates.
5. Convert the set to a list and return it.

The key detail is setting the limit correctly for `i` and `j` to avoid unnecessary computations.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is tied to how many times we iterate to produce the results:
- For each value of `i`, we loop `O(log(bound)/log(x))`.
- For each value of `j`, we loop `O(log(bound)/log(y))`.
  
So, the overall complexity will be proportional to `O((log(bound)/log(x)) * (log(bound)/log(y)))`.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function powerfulIntegers(x, y, bound) {
    let result = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; Math.pow(x, i) <= bound && i < 20; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; Math.pow(y, j) <= bound && j < 20; j++) {
            let value = Math.pow(x, i) + Math.pow(y, j);
            if (value <= bound) {
                result.add(value);
            }
            if (y == 1) break; // to avoid infinite loop when y is 1
        }
        if (x == 1) break; // to avoid infinite loop when x is 1
    }

    return Array.from(result);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(powerfulIntegers(2, 3, 10));  // [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
console.log(powerfulIntegers(3, 5, 15));  // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14]
```

In this code:
1. We use two nested loops to calculate `x^i + y^j`.
2. The loops break early if `x` or `y` is `1` to prevent an infinite loop.
3. We limit the power exponent to a reasonably large number (like 20) to avoid unnecessary large powers.
4. We use a set to store the results and avoid duplicates.
5. Convert the set back to an array for the final result.
