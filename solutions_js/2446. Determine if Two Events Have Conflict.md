[Leetcode 2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2446)
### Problem Statement

You are given two events in the form of strings, `event1` and `event2`. Each event string follows the format `"HH:MM-HH:MM"`, representing the starting and ending time of the event in a 24-hour format. Your task is to determine if the two events have any overlapping time periods and thus have a conflict.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Are the input strings always guaranteed to be in the correct format?
   - A: Yes, we can assume the input strings are always formatted correctly as `"HH:MM-HH:MM"`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we consider the case where one event ends exactly when the other starts as a conflict?
   - A: It depends on the problem definition, but typically events that touch without overlapping are not considered conflicting.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Events:**
   - Split each event by the `'-'` character to get the start time and end time.

2. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - Convert the start and end times of each event into minutes from midnight to make comparison easier.

3. **Check for Overlap:**
   - Two events conflict if the start of one event is before the end of the other event and vice versa.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on the strategy:

```javascript
function haveConflict(event1, event2) {
    // Helper function to convert "HH:MM" to minutes since midnight
    function toMinutes(time) {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(':').map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }
  
    // Parse event times
    const [start1, end1] = event1.split('-').map(toMinutes);
    const [start2, end2] = event2.split('-').map(toMinutes);
  
    // Check for overlap
    return start1 < end2 && start2 < end1;
}

// Test the function with example inputs
console.log(haveConflict("01:15-02:00", "02:00-03:00")); // false
console.log(haveConflict("01:00-02:00", "01:20-03:00")); // true
console.log(haveConflict("10:00-11:00", "14:00-15:00")); // false
console.log(haveConflict("10:00-11:00", "10:30-12:00")); // true
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing Input:** Splitting each event string and converting times to minutes takes constant time since there are a fixed number of operations.
- **Overlap Check:** The comparison operation takes constant time.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the function is **O(1)**.
