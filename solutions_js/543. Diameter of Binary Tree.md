[Leetcode 543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l543)
## Problem Statement

**543. Diameter of Binary Tree**

Given the root of a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any duplicate values in the tree?
   **A:** The values in the tree can be duplicate, but this does not affect the calculation of diameter as it depends on structure.
   
2. **Q:** Can the tree be empty?
   **A:** No, according to the constraints, the tree will have at least one node.
   
3. **Q:** Should the diameter's path be calculated as number of nodes or edges?
   **A:** The diameter is usually measured as the number of edges on the path.

## Strategy

1. **Recursion and DFS Approach:**
   - We will use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the height of the subtree for each node.
   - While calculating the height, we will also determine the longest path passing through that node.
   - The diameter of the tree will be the maximum length found.

2. **Steps:**
   - Implement a helper function `height(node)` that calculates the height of a node.
   - Track the diameter as a variable `diameter` that updates during the height calculation.
   - For each node, calculate the height of the left and right subtree.
   - Update the diameter with the length of the path passing through the node which will be `left_height + right_height`.
   - Return the height of the subtree from the current node.

Below is an implementation in JavaScript:

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function(root) {
    let diameter = 0;

    function height(node) {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        let leftHeight = height(node.left);
        let rightHeight = height(node.right);
        
        // Update the diameter if the path through the current node is larger
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        
        // Return the height of the tree rooted at `node`
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }

    height(root);
    return diameter;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursive call stack. For a balanced tree, the height `h` is `O(log n)`, but for an unbalanced tree, the height could approach `n`.

By calculating both the height and the diameter simultaneously, we ensure the solution is efficient.
