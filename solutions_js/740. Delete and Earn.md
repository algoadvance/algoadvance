[Leetcode 740. Delete and Earn](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l740)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the sum of the numbers you pick by following these rules:
1. For every picked number `num`, you earn `num` points, and every instance of `num - 1` and `num + 1` in the array is deleted.
2. You can pick as many numbers as you want.
3. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by picking numbers based on these rules.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array include negative numbers?**
   No, `nums` will only contain positive integers.
   
2. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   The length of `nums` can vary from 1 to \(10^4\).

3. **Can we assume that the values within `nums` will always be within a certain range?**
   Yes, the values will typically be within the range of 1 to \(10^4\) since \(nums\) is an integer array of practical size for a problem of this nature.

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each number in the array to determine how many points you would get if you choose a particular number.
2. **Transform to House Robber Problem**: Given that you canâ€™t take two consecutive numbers, this problem transforms into a variation of the "House Robber" problem.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points you can earn at any number, considering the constraints of deleting `num - 1` and `num + 1` when you pick `num`.

The steps are as follows:
1. Calculate the frequency of each number.
2. Create a `points` array where `points[num]` is the total points you can earn by picking all occurrences of `num`.
3. Use dynamic programming to determine the maximum points.
   - Let `maxPointsAt[i]` represent the maximum points you can earn considering numbers from `1` to `i`.
   - If you pick `i`, you can't pick `i-1`, so you add `points[i]` to `maxPointsAt[i-2]`.
   - If you don't pick `i`, the max is the same as `maxPointsAt[i-1]`.

### Code
```javascript
var deleteAndEarn = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    
    // Step 1: Calculate the frequency and the total points for each number
    let maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    let points = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        points[num] += num;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Dynamic programming to find the maximum points
    let maxPointsAt = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);
    maxPointsAt[1] = points[1];
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= maxNum; i++) {
        maxPointsAt[i] = Math.max(maxPointsAt[i - 1], maxPointsAt[i - 2] + points[i]);
    }
    
    return maxPointsAt[maxNum];
};

// Example Usage:
console.log(deleteAndEarn([3, 4, 2])); // Output: 6
console.log(deleteAndEarn([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])); // Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n + k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array and \(k\) is the maximum value in `nums`. 
- Calculating the frequency and the total points for each number takes \(O(n)\) time.
- The dynamic programming step takes \(O(k)\) time where \(k\) is the range of the points array. 

This makes the overall efficiency manageable for large input sizes.
