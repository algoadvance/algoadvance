[Leetcode 445. Add Two Numbers II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l445)
### Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. 

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What are the possible ranges for node values?
   **A**: Each node contains a single digit (0-9).

2. **Q**: Are the linked list lengths always the same?
   **A**: No, they can be different.

3. **Q**: Should the result be returned in a linked list which also starts with the most significant digit?
   **A**: Yes, the result should maintain the same order.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. Reverse both linked lists to facilitate addition from the least significant digit.
2. Use a helper function to reverse linked lists.
3. Initialize a dummy node and use a carry variable to handle overflow during addition.
4. Traverse both reversed lists, add corresponding digits and handle the carry.
5. After traversal, check if there is any remaining carry and create a new node if necessary.
6. Reverse the result linked list to restore the correct order.

### Code Implementation
```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
  this.val = val;
  this.next = next;
}

function reverseList(head) {
  let prev = null;
  let current = head;
  while (current !== null) {
    let nextNode = current.next;
    current.next = prev;
    prev = current;
    current = nextNode;
  }
  return prev;
}

function addTwoNumbers(l1, l2) {
  l1 = reverseList(l1);
  l2 = reverseList(l2);

  let dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
  let current = dummyHead;
  let carry = 0;

  while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null || carry > 0) {
    let sum = carry;
    if (l1 !== null) {
      sum += l1.val;
      l1 = l1.next;
    }
    if (l2 !== null) {
      sum += l2.val;
      l2 = l2.next;
    }
    
    carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
    current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
    current = current.next;
  }

  return reverseList(dummyHead.next);
}

// Helper function to create linked list from array
function createLinkedList(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return null;
  let head = new ListNode(arr[0]);
  let current = head;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    current.next = new ListNode(arr[i]);
    current = current.next;
  }
  return head;
}

// Example input
let l1 = createLinkedList([7, 2, 4, 3]);
let l2 = createLinkedList([5, 6, 4]);

// Adding two numbers
let result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2);

// Function to print linked list
function printLinkedList(head) {
  let output = [];
  while (head !== null) {
    output.push(head.val);
    head = head.next;
  }
  console.log(output);
}

// Output the result
printLinkedList(result);  // Should output [7, 8, 0, 7]
```

### Time Complexity
- Reversing the linked lists takes O(n) time complexity.
- Traversing and adding the reversed linked lists takes O(n) time complexity.
- Reversing the resultant linked list takes O(n) time complexity.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the longer linked list.
