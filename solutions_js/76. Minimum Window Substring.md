[Leetcode 76. Minimum Window Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l76)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return an empty string `""`.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

### Constraints:
- `m` and `n` will be at most 10^5.
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity:** Are `s` and `t` case-sensitive?
   - Yes, they are case-sensitive.
2. **Character Validity:** Can `s` or `t` contain special characters or spaces?
   - No, they consist of only English letters.

## Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window and two pointers technique. Here is the proposed strategy:

1. **Frequency Count:** Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each character in `t`.
2. **Sliding Window:** Extend the window to the right character by character until it contains all characters of `t`.
3. **Contract Window:** Once the window contains all characters of `t`, shrink it from the left to find the minimum possible window that still satisfies the condition.
4. **Update Result:** Keep track of the smallest window that satisfies the condition.
5. **Return:** After processing, return the smallest window or an empty string if no such window exists.

## Code
Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function minWindow(s, t) {
    let need = {}, have = {}, formed = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity, res = "";
    
    for (let char of t) {
        need[char] = (need[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    let l = 0, r = 0;
    
    while (r < s.length) {
        let char = s[r];
        have[char] = (have[char] || 0) + 1;
        
        // If current char's count matches the required count in `t`
        if (need[char] && have[char] === need[char]) {
            formed++;
        }
        
        // While window contains all characters of `t`
        while (formed === Object.keys(need).length) {
            // Update result
            if (r - l + 1 < minLength) {
                minLength = r - l + 1;
                res = s.substring(l, r + 1);
            }
            
            // Try to shrink window from the left
            let leftChar = s[l];
            have[leftChar]--;
            if (need[leftChar] && have[leftChar] < need[leftChar]) {
                formed--;
            }
            l++;
        }
        
        r++;
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n)
  - Initializing the frequency maps takes O(n).
  - Each character in `s` is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window, once when contracting), giving O(m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n)
  - Space for the frequency counts of `t` and the sliding window's character counts.
