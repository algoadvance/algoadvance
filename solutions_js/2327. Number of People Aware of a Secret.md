[Leetcode 2327. Number of People Aware of a Secret](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2327)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, the number of days on which the people are aware of a secret. Initially, only one person knows the secret on day 1. You are also given an integer `delay`, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person `delay` days after they know the secret, and an integer `forget`, which means that each person forgets the secret `forget` days after they know it. A person cannot share the secret if they forget it before the `delay` day.

Return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day `n`. 

Since the answer could be massive, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a single person share the secret with multiple people?**
   - Yes, after `delay` days, they can share with someone else.

2. **What exactly happens on the `forget` day?**
   - On the `forget` day, the person forgets the secret and can no longer share it.

3. **Should the number of people aware of the secret include those who will forget it on the same day?**
   - Yes, they are still aware of the secret at the beginning of the `forget` day.

### Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of new people who know the secret on day `i`.

1. Initialize `dp` such that `dp[1] = 1` indicating the first person knows the secret on day 1.
2. Iterate from day 1 to `n`, and for each day, update the number of people learning the secret on subsequent days based on the `delay` and `forget` constraints.
3. We need to keep track of the total number of people aware of the secret and people who forget the secret using additional arrays or cumulative sums.
4. Sum up the number of people who still remember the secret on the nth day while making sure to take values modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} delay
 * @param {number} forget
 * @return {number}
 */
const peopleAwareOfSecret = function(n, delay, forget) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    // dp[i] represents the number of people who know the secret as of day i
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    let newShares = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i + delay <= n) {
            dp[i + delay] = (dp[i + delay] + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
    
        if (i + forget <= n) {
            dp[i + forget] = (dp[i + forget] - dp[i] + MOD) % MOD;
        }
        
        newShares = (newShares + dp[i]) % MOD;
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = n - forget + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(peopleAwareOfSecret(6, 2, 4));  // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate from 1 to n, performing constant time operations within the loop.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - We use an array of size `n+1` to keep track of the number of people.

This approach ensures an efficient calculation of the number of people aware of the secret on the nth day while respecting the memory constraints.
