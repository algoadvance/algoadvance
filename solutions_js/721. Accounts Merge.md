[Leetcode 721. Accounts Merge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l721)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of accounts, each account is a list of strings where the first element is the name of the account holder and the rest are emails. Merge the accounts so that each list of emails in the output represents the same person.

Two accounts should be merged if any email is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they should be merged only if they have at least one common email. The result should be sorted by account name, and within each account, the emails should be sorted lexicographically.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the input and output?**
   - **Input:** `accounts` is a list of lists, where `accounts[i]` is a list of strings. The first element of `accounts[i]` is the account name, and the subsequent elements are emails.
   - **Output:** The function should return a list of lists, each containing the account name followed by the merged and sorted list of emails.

2. **Is there any constraint on the number of accounts or emails?**
   - It is given in typical constraint limits for coding problems, usually about `1000` accounts with about `10` emails each.

3. **Are emails unique as strings?**
   - Yes, all emails are unique as strings and only need to be considered equal if the entire string matches.

## Strategy

We can use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to group emails that should be merged:

1. **Union-Find Creation:** Use Union-Find to connect emails from the same account and across different accounts if they share at least one common email.
2. **Mapping Emails to Accounts:** Use a dictionary to map each email to the corresponding account name.
3. **Merging Accounts:** Once we have connected emails, we can iterate through them to collect all emails that are in the same group and merge them into the final output.

## Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor() {
        this.parent = {};
    }
    
    find(x) {
        if (!(x in this.parent)) {
            this.parent[x] = x;
        }
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]); // path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }
    
    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);
        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        }
    }
}

var accountsMerge = function(accounts) {
    let uf = new UnionFind();
    let emailToName = {};
    
    for (let account of accounts) {
        let name = account[0];
        for (let i = 1; i < account.length; i++) {
            emailToName[account[i]] = name;
            if (i > 1) {
                // union the first email with each subsequent email in the list
                uf.union(account[1], account[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    let emailGroups = {};
    for (let email in emailToName) {
        let rootEmail = uf.find(email);
        if (!(rootEmail in emailGroups)) {
            emailGroups[rootEmail] = [];
        }
        emailGroups[rootEmail].push(email);
    }
    
    let mergedAccounts = [];
    for (let rootEmail in emailGroups) {
        let emails = emailGroups[rootEmail];
        emails.sort();
        mergedAccounts.push([emailToName[rootEmail]].concat(emails));
    }
    
    mergedAccounts.sort((a, b) => a[0].localeCompare(b[0]));
    
    return mergedAccounts;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** The `find` and `union` operations are nearly constant time, O(α(N)), where α is the Inverse Ackermann function. Given the constraints, we can assume these operations to be close to O(1).
- **Building Email Groups:** We traverse each email, essentially iterating over emails to build the groups, O(N * E) where N is the number of accounts and E is the number of emails.
- **Sorting Emails and Accounts:** After merging, we sort the emails and accounts, so the time complexity for sorting is O(E log E).

Overall, the time complexity can be summarized as O(N * E log E) due to the most significant operation being the sorting of emails within each account group.
