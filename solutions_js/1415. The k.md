[Leetcode 1415. The k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1415)
### Problem Statement
A happy string is a string that:
1. Consists only of the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. Does not have any two consecutive characters being the same (i.e., no substrings like "aa", "bb", or "cc").

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k-th` lexicographical happy string of length `n`. If there is no such string, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the ranges for `n` and `k`?
     - Typically, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 3^n - (3^n - 3^(n-1)), as the strings should be "happy".

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output always be a string, even if it's empty?
     - Yes, return an empty string if there is no such string.

3. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - Confirming, you mean lexicographical order similar to dictionary order, right?
     - Correct.

### Strategy
1. **Generate the Happy Strings:**
   - We can use Backtracking to produce all the happy strings of length `n`.
   - Only add characters 'a', 'b', or 'c', ensuring that no two adjacent characters are the same.

2. **Sort and Retrieve the k-th Happy String:**
   - As we generate the strings, store them in a list.
   - Sort the list and access the `k-th` element.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is more than the total number of happy strings of length `n`, return an empty string.

### Code

```javascript
function getHappyString(n, k) {
    const results = [];
    const chars = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

    const backtrack = (currentString) => {
        if (currentString.length === n) {
            results.push(currentString);
            return;
        }
        for (const char of chars) {
            if (currentString.length === 0 || currentString[currentString.length - 1] !== char) {
                backtrack(currentString + char);
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack("");

    if (results.length < k) {
        return "";
    }

    results.sort();
    return results[k - 1];
}

// Example Usage
console.log(getHappyString(1, 3)); // Output: "c"
console.log(getHappyString(3, 9)); // Output: "cab"
console.log(getHappyString(2, 7)); // Output: ""
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Backtracking Generation:**
   - There are at most \( 3^n \) combinations, but many are invalid.
   - Valid strings are fewer due to the "happy" constraint.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the valid happy strings would take \( O(m \log m) \) where \( m \) is the number of valid happy strings.
   
3. **Overall Complexity:**
   - Generating these strings is the most computationally intensive, but this solution ensures handling within limitations efficiently.

**In summary:**
   - Efficient for constraints typically within LeetCode's competitive programming constraints.

Use the backtracking approach to explore all valid combinations, collect, sort and return the `k-th` happy string or an empty string if not sufficient valid strings are found.
