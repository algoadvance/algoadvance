[Leetcode 929. Unique Email Addresses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l929)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of email addresses, we need to determine the number of unique email addresses. When an email address is sent to, it can be processed with slight modifications:

- In the local name (the part before the '@'), all the characters after a '+' should be ignored.
- Additionally, in the local name, all the periods ('.') should be ignored.
- The domain name (the part after the '@') remains unchanged.

For example: 
- Sending an email to "test.email+alex@leetcode.com" and "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com" will be considered as emails sent to "testemail@leetcode.com".

### Example
**Input:**
```text
["test.email+alex@leetcode.com", "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com", "testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
```
**Output:**
```text
2
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
   - Yes, email addresses comparison should follow case-insensitivity rules, especially the domain part.

2. Are there any constraints on the local name or domain length?
   - Typical email constraints apply, but we will assume inputs are valid per specified transformations unless stated otherwise.

## Strategy
1. For each email address in the list:
   - Split the email into the local name and the domain name using the '@' character.
   - For the local name:
     - Remove characters after the first '+'.
     - Remove all occurrences of '.'.
   - Append the transformed local name and the domain name back together.
   - Store the transformed email addresses in a Set to ensure uniqueness.
2. Finally, return the size of the Set, which gives the count of unique email addresses.

## Code
```javascript
function numUniqueEmails(emails) {
    const uniqueEmails = new Set();

    for (let email of emails) {
        let [local, domain] = email.split("@");
        local = local.split('+')[0].replace(/\./g, '');
        uniqueEmails.add(`${local}@${domain}`);
    }

    return uniqueEmails.size;
}

// Example usage:
const emails = ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com", "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com", "testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"];
console.log(numUniqueEmails(emails)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- Splitting each email by '@' and '+' takes O(N) time for each email.
- Replacing '.' in the local part is also O(N).
- Storing in a Set and checking for uniqueness takes average O(1) time per insertion.
- Thus, overall time complexity is O(M * N), where M is the number of emails and N is the average length of an email address.

By following this strategy, the solution efficiently processes each email and correctly computes the number of unique email addresses.
