[Leetcode 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1589)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents a request to increment each element of the subarray `nums[start_i]` through `nums[end_i]` by 1.

You should maximize the sum obtained by any permutation of the array `nums` after processing all requests.

Return the maximum sum obtained. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]
Output: 19

Explanation: 
Resulting permutation of nums may be [5,3,2,4,1]:
requests[0]: Increment the subarray [2,3,4] -> [5,4,3,5,1]
requests[1]: Increment the subarray [1,2] -> [5,5,4,5,1]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, per the problem specification, `nums` contains positive integers.
   
2. **Can the length of `nums` be zero?**
   - No, `nums` contains at least one element.

3. **Is there an upper limit on the number of requests?**
   - Yes, given constraints in the problem usually ensure a feasible solution approach.

## Strategy

1. **Count Contributions:**
   - Use a frequency array to track the number of times each element in `nums` needs to be incremented due to requests.
   
2. **Sort and Assign:**
   - Sort the `nums` array in descending order to maximize the sum.
   - Sort the frequency array in descending order as well, so that the highest numbers are assigned to the most frequently incremented positions to maximize the sum.

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Multiply corresponding elements from the sorted `nums` and frequency arrays, summing up the results.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Since the answer may be large, return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```javascript
const maxSumRangeQuery = function(nums, requests) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = nums.length;
    const freq = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Counting the number of times each index is hit by the requests
    for (const [start, end] of requests) {
        freq[start]++;
        if (end + 1 < n) freq[end + 1]--;
    }
    
    // Convert freq to prefix-sum to get actual frequencies.
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        freq[i] += freq[i - 1];
    }
    
    // Sort both nums and freq in descending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    freq.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Compute the maximum sum
    let maxSum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        maxSum = (maxSum + nums[i] * freq[i]) % MOD;
    }
    
    return maxSum;
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const requests = [[1, 3], [0, 1]];
console.log(maxSumRangeQuery(nums, requests)); // Output: 19
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing the requests:** O(m) where m is the number of requests.
- **Converting frequency array to prefix sums:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Sorting `nums` and `freq`:** O(n log n) for each sort.
- **Computing the final sum:** O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + m), making the approach efficient given typical constraints.
