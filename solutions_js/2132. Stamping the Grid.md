[Leetcode 2132. Stamping the Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2132)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each cell is in one of two states:
- 0 representing an empty cell.
- 1 representing a filled cell.

You are also given a `stamp` grid, which is smaller (with dimensions `x` by `y`) and contains only 1's. Your goal is to determine if it's possible to stamp the given stamp grid over the binary `grid` such that all the 1's in the `grid` become 0's.

A stamp can be placed only on empty cells (cells containing 0). Once a stamp is placed, the cells covered by the stamp will change from 0 to 1.

Return `true` if it's possible to achieve the goal using any number of stamps (including 0), otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the stamp be rotated or flipped before placing on the grid?
   - No, the stamp can only be placed in its given orientation.
   
2. Can the stamp be placed such that it partially overlaps areas with 1's?
   - No, the stamp can only cover 0's and will turn them into 1's.

3. Is it guaranteed that the stamp grid is always smaller than the binary grid?
   - Yes, **x <= m** and **y <= n**.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the grid and keep trying to place the stamp in every possible valid position on the grid. During each trial, we'll mark the cells already covered by the stamp, ensuring no conflicts arise according to the rules set by the problem. Ultimately, after trying all potential positions, if we have marked all cells that were initially marked as 1, then we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

### Key Points to Consider

1. Iterate over every potential start position `(i, j)` for the stamp.
2. Check whether the stamp can fully convert the cells matching its size starting from `(i, j)`. This can be checked using a nested loop.
3. If a stamp is placed successfully, mark the respective cells, indicating they are changed.
4. After the iteration, verify that the grid has no cells left unchanged from 1 to 0.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
var possibleToStamp = function(grid, stamp) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const x = stamp.length;
    const y = stamp[0].length;

    // Prepare a 2D array to mark cells turned from 0 to 1
    const marked = Array(m).fill(0).map(() => Array(n).fill(false));

    const checkAndMark = (i, j) => {
        for (let k = 0; k < x; k++) {
            for (let l = 0; l < y; l++) {
                if (stamp[k][l] === 1) {
                    if (i + k >= m || j + l >= n || grid[i + k][j + l] === 1 || marked[i + k][j + l]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        for (let k = 0; k < x; k++) {
            for (let l = 0; l < y; l++) {
                if (stamp[k][l] === 1) {
                    marked[i + k][j + l] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < m - x + 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n - y + 1; j++) {
            if (checkAndMark(i, j)) {
                for (let k = 0; k < x; k++) {
                    for (let l = 0; l < y; l++) {
                        grid[i + k][j + l] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1 && !marked[i][j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Iterating over all positions within the grid where the stamp could start: \(O((m-x+1) \cdot (n-y+1))\).
- For each position, checking and marking cells covered by the stamp involves nested loops over the stamp: \(O(x \cdot y)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O((m-x+1) \cdot (n-y+1) \cdot x \cdot y)\).

The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the `marked` array, which is \(O(m \cdot n)\).

This solution efficiently places the stamp, ensures all positions are covered, and checks conformity to the problem constraints.
