[Leetcode 2956. Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2956)
### Problem Statement:
Given two arrays, write a function that returns the common elements between these two arrays. Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the numbers in the array? Are they integers or can they be other types?
   - What is the maximum and minimum length of the arrays?
   - Are there any constraints on space or time complexity?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the common elements be returned in sorted order or in the order of their appearance?
   - Is an empty array a valid input? If so, should we return an empty array for this case?

Assuming typical integer arrays with no constraints on size, time, or space, here's how we can proceed.

### Strategy:
1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each element in both arrays.
  
2. **Intersection Logic:**
   - Traverse one of the counts and check if the element exists in the other count.
   - The number of times an element should appear in the result is the minimum count of that element in both arrays.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - Construct the result array based on the common elements and their counts.

### Code:
```javascript
function findCommonElements(arr1, arr2) {
    const map1 = new Map();
    const map2 = new Map();
    
    // Populate map1 with frequencies of elements in arr1
    for (let num of arr1) {
        map1.set(num, (map1.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Populate map2 with frequencies of elements in arr2
    for (let num of arr2) {
        map2.set(num, (map2.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const result = [];
    
    // Find common elements based on minimum frequencies
    for (let [num, count] of map1) {
        if (map2.has(num)) {
            let minCount = Math.min(count, map2.get(num));
            for (let i = 0; i < minCount; i++) {
                result.push(num);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(findCommonElements([1, 2, 2, 1], [2, 2])); // Output: [2, 2]
console.log(findCommonElements([4, 9, 5], [9, 4, 9, 8, 4])); // Output: [4, 9]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Building the maps:** O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `arr1` and `m` is the length of `arr2`.
- **Constructing the result:** O(n) in the worst case where every element is common and appears frequently.
- **Total complexity:** O(n + m), which is optimal for this problem.

### Space Complexity:
- **Maps storage:** O(n + m) for the two hash maps, where `n` is the length of `arr1` and `m` is the length of `arr2`.
- **Result array:** In the worst case, the space required for the result can be O(min(n,m)).
- **Total auxiliary space:** O(n + m).
