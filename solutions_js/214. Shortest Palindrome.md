[Leetcode 214. Shortest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l214)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to find the shortest possible palindrome by adding characters in front of it. You can add as many characters as you want such that the resulting string forms a palindrome.

**Example:**

1. Input: `s = "aacecaaa"`
   Output: `"aaacecaaa"`
2. Input: `s = "abcd"`
   Output: `"dcbabcd"`

Let's break down the process required to accomplish this task.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string `s` contain special characters or spaces?
   - Typically, `s` will contain only lower-case English letters.
   
2. What should we return if the input string is already a palindrome?
   - If `s` is already a palindrome, return `s` as is, because adding zero characters is the shortest intervention.

3. What is the range of the length of input string `s`?
   - Assume the length can be up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

1. To determine the shortest palindrome, consider the reverse of string `s` which is `rev_s`.
2. Create a new string by appending `s` to `rev_s` with special character `#` (which is guaranteed not to appear in `s`). Let this combined string be `combined = s + '#' + rev_s`.
3. Use the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm to compute the "longest prefix which is also a suffix" (LPS) array for the `combined` string.
4. The value of the last element in the LPS array gives us the length of the largest palindrome starting from the beginning of the original string `s`.
5. Add the necessary characters from `rev_s` to the beginning of `s` to form the shortest palindrome.

## Code

Let's put the strategy into code:

```javascript
function shortestPalindrome(s) {
    // Helper function to create LPS array using KMP algorithm
    function computeLPSArray(s) {
        let lps = new Array(s.length).fill(0);
        let length = 0;  // length of the previous longest prefix suffix
        let i = 1;      // the loop calculates lps[i] for i = 1 to len(s)-1
        
        while (i < s.length) {
            if (s[i] === s[length]) {
                length++;
                lps[i] = length;
                i++;
            } else {
                // This is tricky. Consider the example. AAACAAAA and i = 7.
                if (length !== 0) {
                    length = lps[length - 1];
                    // Also, note that we do not increment i here
                } else { // if (len == 0)
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }

    let rev_s = s.split('').reverse().join('');
    let combined = s + '#' + rev_s;
    
    let lps = computeLPSArray(combined);
    
    // Calculate the characters to be added at the start
    let add_length = s.length - lps[combined.length - 1];
    let to_add = rev_s.substring(0, add_length);
    
    return to_add + s;
}

// Testing the function
console.log(shortestPalindrome("aacecaaa")); // "aaacecaaa"
console.log(shortestPalindrome("abcd")); // "dcbabcd"
```

## Time Complexity

1. Creating the `rev_s` string takes O(n) time.
2. Constructing the `combined` string takes O(n) time.
3. Computing the LPS array using the KMP algorithm takes O(3n) = O(n) time since the length of `combined` is 2n+1.
4. Calculating the characters to add and constructing the final string takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which should be efficient for the given constraints.
