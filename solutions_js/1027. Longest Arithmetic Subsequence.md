[Leetcode 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1027)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic sequence if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
   - The length can go up to 1000.

2. **Element Range**: What is the range of element values in `nums`?
   - The elements in `nums` can range from \( -10^4 \) to \( 10^4 \).

3. **Output**: Do we need to return the length only, or the subsequence as well?
   - Return only the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence.

4. **Empty Array**: What should be returned if the input array is empty?
   - Return 0 for an empty array.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][diff]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index `i` with a common difference `diff`.
    - Iterate through each pair of elements and compute their difference. Update the `dp` table using the previously computed values.
    - Track the maximum length of any arithmetic subsequence found during the iterations.

2. **Initialization**:
    - For each element, initialize the hashmap for that index in the `dp` array.

3. **Update Rule**:
    - For every pair `(j, i)` with `j < i`, compute `diff = nums[i] - nums[j]`.
    - Update `dp[i][diff]` to be `dp[j][diff] + 1` if `dp[j][diff]` already exists, else start a new sequence with length 2 (since any two numbers form a valid subsequence).

4. **Result**:
    - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` table plus 1 (since the subsequences are at least of length 2).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestArithSeqLength = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;

    // Array of maps to store lengths of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Map());
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            let diff = nums[i] - nums[j];
            // If there is already a sequence ending at j with difference diff
            if (dp[j].has(diff)) {
                dp[i].set(diff, dp[j].get(diff) + 1);
            } else {
                dp[i].set(diff, 2); // Start a new sequence of length 2
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i].get(diff));
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We have two nested loops to check every pair `(j, i)` with `j < i`.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n \cdot d) \), where `d` is the number of unique differences. In the worst case, each `dp[i]` can store `d` different entries (differences).

This approach efficiently utilizes dynamic programming to track and extend arithmetic subsequences by leveraging differences between array elements.
