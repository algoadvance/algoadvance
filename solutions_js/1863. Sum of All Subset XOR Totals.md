[Leetcode 1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1863)
## Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums`, you need to determine the sum of all subset XOR totals.

- A subset's XOR total is defined as the XOR of all its elements.
- The XOR total of an empty subset is considered to be 0.

Return the sum of all subset XOR totals generated from the array `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of `nums`?
   - What is the range of the values in `nums`?

   **Assumption based on typical LeetCode constraints:**
   - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 16.
   - The values in `nums` are between 0 and 1000.

2. **Input:**
   - Should we consider any special cases such as all elements being the same?
   - Is it guaranteed that `nums` will not be empty?

3. **Output:**
   - What should be returned as the output in terms of data type? (Should be a number)

## Strategy:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Utilize recursion to generate all possible subsets.
   - For each subset, calculate the XOR value.
   - Sum all these XOR values.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - Using backtracking to explore subsets by including or excluding each element.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Given the constraint `1 <= nums.length <= 16`, the maximum number of subsets for the array would be `2^16`, which is 65536. This is feasible for a recursive approach.

## Code:

Here's the implementation using the recursive approach to generate subsets and calculate the XOR totals:

```javascript
function subsetXORSum(nums) {
    // Helper function to generate all subsets and calculate XOR totals
    function backtrack(index, currentXOR) {
        if (index === nums.length) {
            // Add current XOR total to the sum
            totalSum += currentXOR;
            return;
        }
        // Either include the current element in the subset
        backtrack(index + 1, currentXOR ^ nums[index]);
        // Or exclude the current element from the subset
        backtrack(index + 1, currentXOR);
    }

    let totalSum = 0;
    backtrack(0, 0);
    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(subsetXORSum([1, 3])); // Output should be the sum of XORs of all subsets of [1, 3]
console.log(subsetXORSum([5, 1, 6])); // Output should be the sum of XORs of all subsets of [5, 1, 6]
```

## Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is `O(2^n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This complexity arises because we explore every possible subset.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the recursion stack used during backtracking, where `n` is the depth of the recursion stack (which corresponds to the number of elements in `nums`).
