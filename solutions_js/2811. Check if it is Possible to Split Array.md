[Leetcode 2811. Check if it is Possible to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2811)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `m`. Return `true` if it is possible to split the array into exactly `m` non-empty arrays such that the sum of the values in each subarray is **positive**. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the subarrays overlap?
   - No, subarrays must be non-overlapping.
2. What should be done if the array has less than `m` elements or the sum of all elements cannot be split into `m` positive sums?
   - If `nums` has fewer elements than `m` or it’s not possible to split it to meet the condition, return `false`.
3. Are all elements of `nums` guaranteed to be integers, and can they be both positive and negative?
   - Yes, all elements of `nums` are integers and can be both positive and negative.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Check**: Verify if the length of `nums` is less than `m`. If so, return `false` immediately because you cannot split the array into more parts than there are elements.
2. **Sum Check**: Calculate the total sum of the array. If this sum is non-positive, also return `false` because it’s impossible to split a non-positive sum into positive sums.
3. **Negatives Handling**: Since we need each subarray to have a positive sum, consider how to group negative numbers. The only permissible negative sums should be small enough such that the combined sum of subsequent elements makes the whole subarray positive.
4. **Feasibility Logic**: Iterate through the array and try to form `m` subarrays where all have positive sums. If we can form `m` subarrays with this condition, return `true`, otherwise `false`.

### Code:
```javascript
var canSplitArray = function(nums, m) {
    if (nums.length < m) return false;

    let segmentSum = 0;
    let positiveSegments = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        segmentSum += num;
        if (segmentSum > 0) {
            positiveSegments++;
            segmentSum = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return positiveSegments >= m;
};
```

### Explanation:
1. Start by checking if the number of elements in `nums` is less than `m`. If so, return `false`.
2. Initialize `segmentSum` to accumulate the ongoing sum of the current subarray and a counter `positiveSegments` to keep track of positive subarrays formed.
3. Iterate through each element of `nums`, adding it to `segmentSum`.
4. Once `segmentSum` is positive, reset it (start a new segment) and increment the `positiveSegments` counter.
5. Finally, check if the number of positive segments formed is at least `m`. If so, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. We only need to loop through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
